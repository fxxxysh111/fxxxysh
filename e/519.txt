At my just recently previous job, co worker/manager(he an amazing suck up and got promoted) was a combo platter of lazy/incompetent/liar. When I first started working there, I assisted and mostly cleaned up his messes because ultimately it reflected on the entire IT department. Then I stopped doing that, and he would fail spectacularly yet still recover to save his own ass. Mostly by pure bullshit. Example: He didn follow through with renewing our domain with Network Solutions, host of our MX records, and email shocking stopped delivering. He concocted an DDoS attack story and that is what brought email down, nevermind the fact we are a company of 200 employees with no real front facing servers.

Subjective experience and meaning are the essence of life. What Peterson proposes as a different understanding of truth is not about ignoring scientific facts, but putting the experience of meaning in one life and the subjective truth that results above the scientific dictate. His whole point of Nietzsche whenever he brings him up can be summed up as that, the spiritual understanding of truth (this can also be seen as ethics, or code) has been killed in favor of what are cold, hard and soulless facts. The argument of "well, deal with it" is of course brought up often but thing is the way I experience life does not leave room or any need really for the proposed cold, hard facts, since they don have any impact on my being. I trust my own life experience more than what science proclaims as fact (whatever science finds out today will completely change in 50 years anyway), and that is more relevant to my happiness and success in life. I am not saying I am uncritical of my thinking by the way, I will look into new findings of neuroscience, genetics and ponder on these, but "truth" as what it means to me is a consequence of my individual being.

The "droplet" on the head of a trichome turns from clear to cloudy and that's what provides a more heady and energetic high. Over time the trichomes heads ripen into a deep amber color as the THC degrades into CBN.

Position is of course the other great unknown to the new player. Again to create a more exciting spectacle for the viewer, there is a disproportionate amount of heads up play shown on TV. The non player absorbs this and takes two false impressions from it, one that you should see the flop almost every hand, and secondly that a good heads up hand is a good hand in any circumstance.

Basically, that area is designed for co op. Back when the areas first came out with the vanilla game as DLC, if you didn own the DLC you could set down your summon sign at those stone statues in the front of the area and players who did own the DLC could summon you. Basically, the point was to advertise to the non owning folks "look how cool this DLC is! You should buy it, too!" And the areas were designed to be brutally hard specifically through enemy spam and ganks in order to encourage co op play so that the people who did own the DLC would summon all the folks who didn can see the comparison to the rest of the game: most of the time, if you get "ganked" by more than two enemies at once, even in Scholar, it because you done something wrong you rushed forward when you should have hung back and pulled enemies, or something similar. That is, getting ganked is a sign you made a tactical error. But in the Iron Passage, the Cave of the Dead, the Frigid Outskirts, and the Memory of the Old Iron King, they deliberately throw many hazards at you at once in order to as close as necessary require co op play.)

I think Nintendo biggest problem is how they run. Nintendo even admits it themselves, they consider themselves to be a "toymaker" not an electronics company. They understand they a platform holder, but their approach to 1st party games is that of "we making a toy" and not "we making a video game". That approach to games is why they make some of the best games out there. It also the same approach that has created a situation where Ubisoft has made a better Mario RPG than Nintendo has in the past decade, and it also looks like Ubisoft is about to make a better Star Fox game than Nintendo is willing to (they didn even make SF: Zero, they outsourced that to Platinum Games). But in terms of hardware, that what lead to the manufactured scarcity, because Nintendo does think of themselves as a toymaker, not a video game publisher/developer. This is one the main reasons why I think Nintendo will never actually succeed in making an online system that works or making a console that doesn have some design flaw (see: the Switch god awful WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity).

In order to understand why this "mum" stole so much money and then got sympathy, we have to return to romance as an ideology. People think of romance as "natural" and even "universal." the biochemical changes in a person brain when "in love" (or "in lust") may be innate, how we organize the feelings and desires that love arouses are culturally and historically specific. That sense, romance only became "happily ever after" at the birth of the modern era, as people were increasingly expected to marry for love and stay "in love" (that is, both men and women were supposed to be monogamous and have all their emotional needs filled within the dyadic coupling and that dyadic couple was increasingly isolated from extended family networks into the "nuclear family" in a geography of split level, suburban isolation)..

Many of the studies linking vaccines to autism are significantly smaller in sample size..

Naturally the tension makes for some great films and there have been some absolute classics. At the basic level you have Daniel Craig's Casino Royale which spoon feeds you what's happening at a very basic level. On a more serious note you've got Rounders with Matt Damon and John Malkovic. You can watch the final scene below (Spolier alert, natch) and it's worth noting that the drama of that scene is repeated all of the time in the real deal which is why the game is so attractive.

It's mostly used to describe the dissolution of your sense of self and your identity, either realizing that you are just a piece of the universe or universal consciousness, or when things go bad, believing that reality is a lie and nothing real exists (possibly not even you).

Sorry to hear the struggle you're facing. There is a lot good advice in this thread but it can be overwhelming to listen to any good advice when you are 'inside' the situation. I mean that as you're going through this it's natural to feel cynical about the advice and think that it's easy to say something and difficult to do it. So the first thing I say you do is recognize this and know that you may feel this way. Once you do that it would be easier to sift through the great advice you're getting here and follow something that makes sense to you.

Explaining to them that they can make like an extra 1 dollar an hour means fuck all to them when they probably have a job and the money doesn mean that much to them.. 
It would've been avoided if they had just put the aspect ratio notice on the original thread that hit the top of r/nba right away. Not one of the threads with far less comments that was posted hours later. u/twistedlogicx did in this comment what the mods should've done on the original thread, and that's clarifying the issue. This thread will almost surely not get the attention that original one got, which is a shame because a lot of people would love to see this highlight and it'll most likely get buried now. Not trying to hate on you mods, just wish that next time we could avoid this issue by having some transparency asap.

This might be a simple case of foreign (to Poland) audiences not being able to read the full name, thus deciding to drop the "Skodowska" in articles and books. Marie Curie is relatively easy to puzzle out when reading it. But how does one read the name Skodowska? An English reader would have know clue where to start with "", and sometimes its better to compress names for the sake of readability rather than writing the full name out. Take a look at Spanish naming convention for a similar practice. Pablo Picasso full name is Pablo Diego Ruiz y Picasso, but he almost never identified by his full name in any English sources. Or Arabic naming conventions where you have Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, but his name was usually shortened to either Osama bin Laden, or just bin Laden.

Warum? Sollte das Verfassungsgericht jemals entscheiden, ob Spiele wie Roulette und Poker rechtlich als Geschicklichkeitsspiel oder Glcksspiel eingestuft werden, verliert die Regierung entweder die Mglichkeit, Gewinne zu besteuern (Glcksspiel ist nicht versteuerbar) oder ihr Monopol, diese Spiele anzubieten (Geschicklichkeitsspiele wie Skat darfst du in jeder Kneipe spielen).. 
It's so interesting how she met this guy and is so in love only a few days after they started dating. She needs money and a place to live, so I'm sure this is why she fell in "love" so fast. He hasn't seen the red flags yet because she's too busy rocking his world with the Asuelu moves! Lol. I know in a regular divorce case, your lawyer would advise you to not flaunt your lifestyle or your paramour because it could negatively affect your case. You also shouldn't be living/cohabitating with your paramour. She will lose any and all support from Colt if she is living with someone else. (Don't know the specific laws in NV).

Perhaps we could even take a lesson from Christian Orthodoxy for our postmodern, secular cultures and apply iconography to contemporary media. Within Christian Orthodoxy, images in icons are purposefully made skinnier and elongated to give them a more spiritual and less fleshy quality. The same is true with icons of our consumer culture.

When you say you consider intelligence to be the variable that matters   again, that because you chosen that (as a human) because it something that has helped humans survive. But vision and flying navigation skills are something that help raptors survive. Digging and eusocial behaviour help naked mole rats survive. Asexual reproduction helps flat worms survive. Intelligence is just one route to survival   it happens to be the one that applies to us (so we think it is special)   but if it were the only route, then all species would have it (because we all evolved and extant species exist). Species wouldn be around and exist if they hadn figured out that supplement their survival   so again be aware of the inherent you doing here, and the anthropcentric bias that represents.

"Give it another three or five years. Poker here is going to be as huge as anywhere else in the world." It's a tempting bet, but can you ever really trust a poker player?

To play Texas hold em and win, you need to make the best hand possible out of your hand. The two cards you receive at the beginning, and the community cards, will help you make the best hands. While you play, you can bet on how well your hand is, if you think you have the highest hand. You will base your bet depending on the two cards you have and the other option is to fold. There will be three cards in front of the dealer faced up called the flop. The next card that will be dealt is known as the flop. When this card is already faced up, large bets will be placed on the Texas holdem table because it will be doubled. When the river card or the fifth card is already dealt, the players will decide if they will raise, check, call or fold. the dealer deals out 2 cards face down. these are called pocket cards. a round of betting takes place. the dealer then turns over 3 cards in the center. thease cards are calledcoummunity carsface upin the also known as the flop. thus each player has the equivalent of a five card poker hand. a 2 round of betting takes place . a thrid round of betting takes place. the dealer will turn over a fith card called the river a 4 round of betting takes place (Full Answer)

I'm sorry, but I simply know more about finance and politics than you do. I've read more, I've studied more, and I care more. I have multiple books on the subject, and I've studied crisis in detail ranging from savings and loan to Enron. I've read the works of Marriner Eccles in the Federal Reserve archives. You probably don't even know who that is. I've read Keynes. I've read Smith. I've read Veblen (have fun slogging through that). I've read Marx. When I play live I kind of get a feel for the environment, the mood of the table, the way people play and who I should be focusing or avoiding. Online I feel like I just clicking buttons, and even if I playing well mechanically, there something of a disconnect for me. I greatly prefer live poker, to the point where I haven played online in years.

Take a moment to wonder at the simple brilliance of the plan. The prison system is filled with connections, eyewitnesses, tips, and hints that the cops could have missed. And with the right incentive, be it money, a will to correct past wrongs, or just snitching on a guy they hate, a prisoner can be perfectly willing to aid the police. This caused the police to reopen the case three decades after the crime, examine the evidence, and eventually convict a 57 year old man from Seattle. After a hard knock life and a prison sentence or six, such threats were now old hat, so he had no problem spilling the beans once he learned the case was still open."I did it in exchange for a pack of playing cards NOT covered in dead people's pictures."

My best friend from high school and I were friends since we were each 8. We played world of Warcraft together. I played a warrior and he played a hunger. This was back during Wrath of the Lich King. Both of our classes used the same tier tokens. I think it was in Naxxramas but the tier shoulder token dropped and I won. I also got a necklace he didn't need off the same boss. So I received two pieces of loot. Since one went to me by default and one was won fairly through rolls, everyone was okay. Except him. He demanded I have a GM give him the shoulder (before you could trade loot for a short period of time). I said no, I won them.

Another important principle involves what "level" of poker you are playing at. At level one you know what your hands is. At level two you start thinking about what hand your opponent has, trying to put them on a range of hands based on their play and adjusting your play accordingly. loose aggressive, passive tight, etc.) in order to try to put them on a hand. At level three you will start thinking about what hand your opponent thinks you have. At this stage you will start to realize that certain lines of play will work because they play off what your opponent thinks you have instead of what you really have, and conversely you will abandon certain lines of play, realizing they aren't believable based on what your opponent thinks you have. For instance, certain spots will become optimal to bluff in because your opponent believes you have the cards that allow you to, and other spots will becoming obvious bad spots to bluff. Higher levels involve asking questions like "What does my opponent think I think she has", "What does my opponent think that I think he thinks I have?" etc. This is very advanced play and requires that you first of all know whether it is even appropriate to be thinking like this   in fact, for optimal play you should generally play one level higher than your opponent, especially at higher levels.

Determining the most optimal base of the exponential scale (normalization) is difficult in practise. The base corresponding to the Fibonacci scale may or may not be optimal."The precision of your estimation as well is very likely to be proportional to your estimation." Is this a rule in statistics or is this something humans normally do? If you use Fibonacci numbers, you assume, that the relative error of an estimation is about f(n 1)/f(n) = 1 goldenratio = 61 %. So if one estimates 5, people assume this implies a relative error of about 3, so a significant increase in complexity would only be 8 or higher.

A graphic illustration appeared on the front page of the New York Times on August 4. Two major stories appear side by side. One discusses how Republicans fervently oppose any deal "that involves increased revenues"   a euphemism for taxes on the rich. The other is headlined "Even Marked Up, Luxury Goods Fly Off Shelves." The pretext for cutting taxes on the rich and corporations to ridiculous lows is that they will invest in creating jobs   which they cannot do now as their pockets are bulging with record profits.

There are simply more runners and more organized races relative to the total population nowadays. Competitive runners are still competitive, and it not all that hard for them to find what they looking for, but they can expect every local fast guy to show up at every local 5k when there are half a dozen races within driving distance every week of the year. Maybe they the ones not living up to their potential anymore since the toughest competition isn guaranteed to show up at every race. I don know. I just don think it fair to point at people with different goals and say they afraid of improvement. People who would have been actively pushed away from running back in the good old days are finding their own reasons to pursue it, and that a good thing.

My mom isn a native Arabic speaker but she learned it to a point that even her accent is native like and no one can even tell she not Arab. She did it purely by immersion. Her original language was east African so language family wise it wasn THAT far off but she did learn it all practically by immersion. However, just immersion isn enough. Once you go to an Arab country you need to practically live an Arab life. Make Arabs friends, get a job (even if part time) in Arabic, and consume Arab media only. I don know about other Arab countries but rising Gulf countries are very accepting to people who speak Arabic to an intermediate or below intermediate level so I would suggest going there. They have lots and lots of immigrants from non Arab countries and another giant group of Arab immigrants so you would be exposed to all dialects and not just one. There also community classes made to teach non natives Arabic if you are worried about having formal instruction. I wasn advanced by any means I was barely touching intermediate at the time. I used to look up any words that I wanted to say and couldn consistently and over time these words just stuck cause I was using them. I haven actively worked on vocab in a long time (my fault I lazy) but while writing recently I realized I needed the dictionary a lot less and I knew a lot of words that I never went out of my way to learn. That method helped reinforce the grammar that I learned and kept consistently learning while adding vocab in the mix.

Les temps et les murs ont bien changs depuis l de Baudelaire: aujourd les deux usages (mdecine, toxicomanie) sont illgaux dans de nombreux pays.

Omega 3 fatty acids, contained in oily fish such as salmon and trout, selectively inhibit growth and induce cell death in early and late stage oral and skin cancers, according to new research from scientists at Queen Mary, University of London.In vitro tests showed omega 3 fatty acids induced cell death in malignant and pre malignant cells at doses which did not affect normal cells, suggesting they have the potential to be used in both the treatment and prevention of certain skin and oral cancers.Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be made by humans in large quantities and so we must acquire them from our diet.The scientists were studying a particular type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Squamous cells are the main part of the outermost layers of the skin, and SCC is one of the major forms of skin cancer. However, squamous cells also occur in the lining of the digestive tract, lungs, and other areas of the body.Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are the sixth most common cancer worldwide and are difficult and very expensive to treat.In the experiments, the scientists grew cell cultures in the lab from several different cells lines to which they added fatty acids.The cell lines included both malignant oral and skin SCCs, along with pre malignant cells and normal skin and oral cells.Professor Kenneth Parkinson, Head of the Oral Cancer Research Group at Queen Mary Institute of Dentistry, said:found that the omega 3 fatty acid selectively inhibited the growth of the malignant and pre malignant cells at doses which did not affect the normal cells.we discovered this was partly due to an over stimulation of a key growth factor (epidermal growth factor) which triggered cell death.

Instead of writing a concise story with the interesting premise he had he spends so much time just adding in tangents like the thing with Sadie ex and the school play   by the time I got that far in the book I was pretty much mentally heckling him for including this weird "Hallmark original movie" level of sentimental shit. 
If he puts up 35 ppg, the response from detractors will be "Its against mid level euro teams, and they feed him the ball". God forbid he had bad defensive ratings, that would hurt his stock a ton.

I played $5/$10 a few weeks ago with Bilzerian at Aria. Granted it was $5/$10 and like micro stakes to him, but he was pretty bad. All he was trying to do was just make big bets and bully everyone, but that wasn working for him. He stacked off $3k within an hour and sure, that doesn mean jack shit to him, but he was playing just like the video above which is pretty bad. His strategy might work for him when he makes a $500k river bluff on the high stakes table and people shit their pants wondering if their top pair is still good. But I cannot fathom that Bilzerian is a winning poker player overall.
