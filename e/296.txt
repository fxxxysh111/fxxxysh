I was working in the painters union 5 6 years ago, painting structures at a natural gas processing plant in a very remote location. The plant was under construction so there was a lot of construction taking place at once. A few hundred workers, pretty much dressed the same. The plant had an unusual layout, there was a small public road that ran right through the middle of it, open to public traffic. Maybe a dozen private vehicles a day, the rest were there for the construction. A man came right in the plant during work hours, dressed like he was working there, started up a large, I mean large! Telehand forklift. About the size of a dump truck. Drove it over to the material supply yard, picked up a industrial sized spoil of copper wire. I would say close to 5k worth of copper sold at scrap. Then drove right out of the plant, on the public road. He loaded the spoil into his truck. He Left the forklift on the side of the road. No body knew it was gone until the next day when they couldn find the forklift. I don think ever caught the guy, I never heard anything else about it.

I think everything he says is false with a ring of truth. I thought about this yesterday: he is still blaming SW. Even if it was a "crime of passion" (which I know this isn't but it seems like that's what he is inferring) it wouldn't make sense to then murder your children. After driving them 40 minutes. Nearly an hour where you could have said "wait oh no I messed up badly let me do the right thing" if anything his new statement just highlights this entire thing being premeditated. So, I think with this latest "confession" some things make more sense unfortunately. Although now that I'm typing this out it doesn't, why drive the girls 40 minutes to the site before killing them? The only reason that makes more sense to me is because of the "shadows" which I realize hasn't been confirmed by anyone in LE so I guess I shouldn't keep thinking that's evidence they were still alive. Sorry for the rambling. I agree with your post about him still blaming her it's sick.

She would tell me a lot of inappropriate things about my father. I remember the year between this, 2001, when I was in 6th grade, was when I noticed her starting to act weird. She would stay out all night, come home in the morning and. generally yell nonsensical, abusive things at me, then leave again. I guess it's been so long, and I've tried to forget. I know one time she took several thousand dollars out of my dad's savings account and used it to buy a Mustang convertible. She was driving out in the country and hit a deer and wrecked the car within days.
If someone says something you disagree with, then you should and are basically obligated to criticize it. However, there a difference between criticizing specific beliefs or things that people have said and smearing/dehumanizing an entire group of people as "far right" in the pages of The Guardian. Call it a boy who cried wolf situation. Tommy Robinson got banned from Facebook and financial services like PayPal, Mark Meechan got his BBC contract cancelled in a day for being a "hate criminal", etc., and thousands of UK citizens get arrested and thrown in jail for things they say online or in real life each year. If you want people to take you seriously when you criticize "far right" bigotry and hate speech in the future, then you also need to do a better job of criticizing bad behavior on your side and reforming the popular perception that you more similar to totalitarian Nazis than the far right is.

You obviously have absolutely no idea what this is like in real life, but in my small home town, you can not get an apartment cheaper than $850/month unless you have roommates. That is staying in a dangerous, violent, drug ridden area. 40 hours at minimum wage isn't even $1257 a month, you wouldn't even be making twice rent, and that's before taxes. Now count health care, food, travel (even if it's by bus), cell phone. yeah it's not happening. That's why I work full time, I'm in school, I qualify for food stamps, AND my mom has to pay all of my rent, insurance, and phone bill, and bought me my car. I make $2 above minimum wage. I wouldn't have been able to move out if my mom didn't co sign for me because of the income rule.
As a result, after about 14 15, I never spoke to my mother about anything important   because it felt like it didn matter, she dig through my school notebooks to find the notes my friends and I wrote to each other and would demand access to all of my online accounts to read my private messages anyway.

I a pet supplies plus employee. From stuff I learned at work, information I gotten from my vet, and experience with my own dog, purina is very low quality food. I do not trust any of their products. They have had various recalls recently. We have had customers return bags that had moths, worms or metal fragments in them. (Bags in our store are not put on the shelves before being meticulously checked for openings, and expiration dates are checked as well.) Many of the returns I dealt with were recent purchases too. Their food is generally high in fat and has a lot of unhealthy fillers for dog and cat food like corn. They produce their food in such large quantities that their quality control isn as good as other brands of food such as wellness, orijen, arcana, etc. I was feeding my dog proplan before switching to Redford, PSP brand. I started on redford with my dog about 8 months ago and I noticed a change in his health. His coat is healthier, he has lost weight, has more energy and his stools are healthier as well. Unfortunately purina is generally a lot more affordable then the more natural and healthier options. Of course every animal is different, some dogs and cats do just fine eating alpo or friskies and have limited health issues but there is a trend with dogs and cats that are fed purina having more health problems than animals fed on higher quality foods.
They have little control other than some minor wiggling.

If they want to have any chance of getting to Yezza before he tortured to death (unless the dark elves are going to keep this dude alive forever like the dwarves and Kima), assuming they haven already killed him, they need to go back up and talk to the two mages and say, "hey we know where the artifact is and is heading and you probably have a teleportation circle somewhere behind enemy lines by X city let do the thing"
I also would disagree it ruined her character  it changed her from the peace loving mage, whom I would argue was very one note and had lost relevance at the time, into a character with a neat internal conflict  someone who had forsaken her family for peace was now facing unjust consequences for her good nature, which would make anyone bitter.

At first it was a fairly technocratic arrangement, because the research institutions wanted to ensure the projects they had marked out would not be cancelled or the land repurposed. The political history of Shaja was dominated by the slow persuasion of the institutions by the increasingly complex government that they could be trusted not to do that. These days it a democratic socialist government and economy with a single chamber of representatives; these are proportional to population so the numbers of said representatives are slowly increasing over time. 
I just don want you to feel personally attacked by this. I do agree with the other half of what people are saying; you need to find a new doctor and practice. You can even try to get a referral to see a specialist, in those terms, because in some areas your GP isn even the one that should be doing the assessment in the first place. Finding someone qualified to work with Adult AD/HD is hard, and finding the strength to advocate for yourself in the medical system is even harder. Try to do some searching on your own for someone in your area that can assess you and ask for a referral to them. 40 points  submitted 13 days ago

The 4 rivers trail system (and others) has a passport system with stamp booths along the way, so you get to fill out your little pass book as you go along eac lh trail. At some of the checkpoints there is an office where you can get as completing a trail, you get a big shiny sticker in your passport and a little sticker to put on your helmet (or wherever, I put mine on my desk) anyways, every check point should (and usually does) have an ink pad. But almost every time I have gone to stamp my book the previous person had left the ink pad open, drying it out. So it a good idea to bring your own inkpad.

L'uomo  parte dell'Universo e i pianeti, con il loro simbolismo, fanno parte di quella che Jung definiva "Legge della sincronicit".

Frase che fa riflettere per il suo profondo significato. In virt di questa legge, quanto accade nel macrocosmo  riflesso per analogia anche nelle particelle pi infinitesimali dell'universo. Ogni movimento planetario vibra in maniera potente anche all'interno di noi, obbligandoci a rispondere, vibrando, a quanto l'universo propone.

He got fucked against Khabib and Nate (first fight) but his fight IQ when he was in featherweight was tremendous.

When people buy books from the specialty store, the person who owns the specialty bookstore gets a commission (up to 10 percent of the book's list price) from Amazon. The affiliate program gives Amazon great exposure because it now has over 1,000,000 specialty bookstores all over the Web [ref]. Therefore this model is now copied by thousands of e commerce sites. If you are setting up an e commerce site you will want to consider an affiliate program as one way to get exposure. Link Share is a company that helps e commerce sites set up affiliate programs.

Max may get an annual bonus of $13,500 which would be $700 to $800 per month after tax. That provides wiggle room in addition to current unallocated savings of as much as $1,053 per month. That income flow can go to the kids for university expenses other than room and board, for they live at home. In three years, when the kids have finished university, this money can go to retirement savings, Einarson advises. Those savings can be added to their present cash balance, $69,594. For now, if they reserve $34,000 for the remaining university expense, they will have $35,594 for mortgage paydown. The outstanding balance, $262,606 less this residual cash would leave a balance of about $227,000. To pay off that balance in the dozen years to Loretta age 65, assuming three per cent interest, would require monthly payments of $1,880. That $435 more than their present mortgage cost of $1,445 per month, but it would ensure that they go into retirement with no major debt. They could still add $480 to their RRSPs and $500 to TFSAs each month, as they do now, and boost these contributions with leftover cash.

A final note: in prose and poetry the Latin word "Quantum" has been mixed up with the word "Quintum" time and time again; Quintum means "a fifth" of something and has also been used as a measurement (equaling 3.65 grams) in pharmacy. The German language has actually wrongfully adapted the word over the centuries and turned it into "Quentchen" (a very small amount)   instead of "Quintchen". Chances are that this happened in other languages, too, but that now is the moment for a native British linguist to step in.

The scene in which Rogers tells his father that he wants to study business rather than medicine is among the novel's most moving. Disappointed at his son's decision but still unfailingly empathetic, Dr. Stout tells Rogers: "I'm so proud to be your father. I only wish your mother were here to witness your growth and development. If you want to head off to Philadelphia, do it. I'm sure you will impress them and excel at whatever you choose to do." Rogers, who hates to cry, cannot hold back his tears.

This comment is too low. I agree, this dream sequence would have crappy, especially for reason 1. One thing which Bioware has said quite a bit is that they want to make their future games respect the choices made in the earlier games.

It is falsely said that online poker site is usually rigged. It is believed that new players win a lot of money initially before tailing off into a losing spree. 
IMO it is a dangerously radical political device that reads like a progressives wish list. It lumps the objectives of climate change with other agendas like guaranteed wages for everyone, union rights, the gender wage gap, racism, protecting communities of color. It's not that I don't agree with those things and want them too, but I think it is dangerous to tie them together like this because you politicize climate change and you alienate the right and moderate politicians.

While it's true adults are less vulnerable than children (I'm aware 18 is adulthood, thanks!), that doesn't make anything done to them completely acceptable. I don't want anyone to think that if a professor or boss comes to them and says "hey, your grade is slipping/your job is in danger, but you can make it up to me" through sex that a) that's in anyway acceptable for someone with power over them to do and b) that they have no options to get that abuse of power to stop.

Koreans, regardless of age, can not seem to understand that a human being in a civilized democratic society has the right to believe and say whatever their heart desires, however ridiculous and scrutinized those beliefs may be, such as communism. I can go to the library and check out mein kampf, visit north korean websites, and even advocate communism and nazism if I truly wanted to. When Americans see demonstrations of people wearing clothing with swatstikas, waving the nazi flag, and advocating for white supremacy/nazism, we condemn them and stand up for what right. 
The number of 6 10 year old little girls who have "official" instagram accounts "monitored by mom!" posting videos and pictures of them in their leotards, sharing all kinds of information about their lives is fucking disturbing.

There plenty wrong with the justice system. There plenty wrong with DREs and the prevalence of pseudoscience in the courts, though the latter is at least as likely to get an acquittal or false finding of incompetence as it is to get a conviction. 
Its also reasonable to assume that some are controlled opposition who goal is to drive wedges in these movements so they don actually unify to get anything done. Its been documented that the FBI and CIA did all that stuff in the 1960s 70s and there is no reason to think that they and various local police forces have stopped infiltrating and disrupting these groups. Occupy Wallstreet likely got into the internal disagreements over how to organize when all these types showed up, some of which may well have been infiltrators trying to undermine them from the inside.

No, only a child would think that there's only one way to do things, and if that way makes you money, then that way is the right way.

Pascalev says that she and her husband had a wide range of concerns about smart meters, most of which seem to be privacy related. Collecting so much continuous data, she says, allows a utility company "to infer when and where the inhabitants are in the house, how they move around inside, what appliances they use and hence what they do.

Yes, but I wouldn avoid getting one simply because of what others might think of me, including my family and friends..

During a weeknight review visit, my dining companion and I found the truck parked outside Gunbarrel Brewing, which provided a spacious and comfortable interior to could enjoy our meal. Some of the sides have a traditional association with fried chicken; others reflect a more modern, farm to table sensibility, no mean feat in sparse winter months. It's a fair guess that Quilling's prior fine dining experience, most notably at Boulder's Oak at Fourteenth, informs this approach..

Air New Zealand have a really smart livery on their 787 Dreamliner, and it is actually different to the regular livery of their aircraft (such as B777 and narrowbody planes). Without being overpowering, the black plane just works and makes it stand out from the runway, whatever the weather. Another change of livery for their modern aircraft has came from Etihad, whose sleek and slender fuselage is now complemented with a cool new tailfin design, which is one of the better liveries here. 
Course, it a little easier here in this (smaller) barn and a little harder in Komoka. For us, it was just play hard and take away the lanes. I think that we did that very well in this whole series.

Before you think I drunk, I saying the abstraction we call ranks, not the members of the rank mentioned, form the doubly linked list. It is the people here, the members of these ranks, that form a tree, although I assume that the nodes at a certain rank also interface with each other at times (ie, their brother and sister nodes) , and with their niece and nephew nodes (ie, if layer 2 is the Barons, and Baron 1 watches over 100 peasants and Baron 2 the other 100 and so on, it is possible that sometimes a group of peasants had to interface with an uncle baron for problems directly. Maybe not though, fuck if I know). The peasants at the very least interfaces directly with their brother and sister nodes . especially if they were, well, brother and sister. I am drunk. Anyways, if you add edges between brother and sister nodes at all or some levels in a tree, I don know what the graph would be described as. Maybe tis then but a graph, maybe its become a special kind of tree, or maybe its still a normal tree with extra steps.
