This question reminds me of a scene from the original Star Trek episode The Corbomite Maneuver where the Enterprise is hopelessly outmatched and the logical Spock makes a chess reference indicating they have lost. Kirk replies to the effect that instead of playing chess they should play poker, and proceeds to make a bluff that succeeds in getting them out of the situation. 
If our first three cards are queens, our question really is, what is the probability that i get a pair given four cards out of 49? Since we already have three queens, we don't want to consider the case where we can get a pair of queens, being as this is clearly impossible. The total number of ways we can get any two cards is 49 C 2, or 1176. Therefore, our probability that we get a pair in any two places of those four cards is 432/1176, or 18/49. However, we aren't done yet because we have to make sure that we don't get another queen or two more of the same previous two cards that we drew on the remaining two cards, because either case would result in four of a kind. Therefore, we need to multiply 18/49 by the odds that neither of the two previous instances occur. The probability that they don't occur is 1 (probability that they do occur). So, the number of ways to get the queen is 2 C 1 1 or 2, and the number of ways to draw the same two cards is 2 C 2 , or 1. Our total number of ways to draw 2 cards from 47 is 47 C 2 , or 1081. So, the odds that we get either the other queen or the other two cards is 3/1081. To get the probability that our cards do not result in either of those two instances is 1 3/1081, or 1078/1081. So, our final probability is 18/49  1078/1081, or 396/1081, giving you an approximate 36.6 percent chance of getting a full house. .

Regarding Mahmoud Abbas, I tend to believe he would like to have an agreement with Israel, but he is even weaker than Olmert. This has been clearly demonstrated with Hamas's takeover of Gaza. Even before this act, he never seemed to be able to enforce his will over Palestinian society, and now it is not clear to me whether he represents the whole of the Palestinian people, or just a fraction of it.

Choice is a really fascinating topic for me in games, and ds2 is a direct answer to a question that the end of ds1 asks: "what are the consequences of my choice to link or not link the fire", and the answer is that there are none, whatever you choose. It also does a lot of interesting things with mental health (npcs, especially Lucatiel), and Buddhism (daughters of Manus, with a big gold star for Nashandra), and I get a lot out of pondering the importance and meaning behind that stuff.People_Are_Savages  3 points  submitted 1 month agofor people who aren familiar with buddhism, the primary belief is this: all suffering in the world comes from desire, the wanting of things you don or can have, and by reducing and eliminating desire you can reduce both the suffering you experience and the suffering inflicted on the world around youNashandra is explicitly a being of "want", and many of her actions increase the suffering of others (and herself) as the cost of obtaining her desires.At the simple end of that concept, she manipulates Vendrick into crossing the sea to make war on the giants for reasons that are not explicit, described vaguely as taking something from them; it not revealed what that thing is, but the result was conflict and death, an eventual revenge attack on Drangleic, and contributing to the divide between herself and Vendrick that eventually would lead him to put a plan in place to stop her from accomplishing her goals.On a wider story level, her ultimate goal seems to be gaining access to the Throne of Want, which is strongly implied to be the Kiln of the First Flame.

Thinking about getting your toes done? Any beauty treatment or procedure involving chemicals, fumes or massage should be OK'd by your doctor beforehand, just to be safe. If you do get a pedicure (or manicure) while pregnant, take some precautions. Make sure the salon's health inspection scores are high, and bring your own nail files and other tools (such as cuticle clippers). This will limit the risk of infections, especially if you get nicked. Don't bother if there's a strong chemical smell in the salon   go somewhere with good ventilation, as those fumes aren't good for you or the baby.
Fast forward to now. Boomers are still in power both politically and in the private sector. Because of their actions, they have fucked a large portion of their own retirements, so they can't leave their jobs. Gen X can't move forward the way boomers were able to, and since Gen X can't move forward, it's hard for millennials to even get in the fucking door. Gen X are okay, but millennials have no money. As a whole, the generation just does not have the financial capacity to do the shit boomers could, which is why we see "millennials are killing [some bullshit that we can't afford/isn't worth spending money on]" articles constantly.

It seems natural that a man would want to last longer during sex. Why wouldn't we be hardwired to prolong something so pleasurable? But in reality, men's sexual desires are malleable, influenced by external factors that scientists are only beginning to understand. In the survey, American men said they should last about 14 minutes, but British blokes thought 10 was plenty, and German guys figured 7 was enough. "A guy in porn can supposedly go at it for 45 minutes. That's not realistic! Even if Europeans have the same cultural references to sexuality, they have the education to break it down and realize it's not real."

Acupuncture. The use of acupuncture and acupressure is thousands of years old. These therapies were developed in ancient China and are based on the theory of energy flowing through a system of channels (called meridians) that flow through the body and are linked to certain internal organs. Disease is seen in large part as disharmony in this internal energy flow, and the purpose of acupuncture is to restore the balance. Acupuncturists may do this by using needles, finger pressure, heat sources, or other methods to manipulate certain specific points (or acupoints) along the meridians. Western scientific research is still at a loss to explain why acupuncture works. Some theories suggest that inserting the needles increases the body's production of endorphins (substances that make you feel better and more comfortable) and blocks the transmission of pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain.

Environment and Climate Change Canada said it has issued a permit for Ottawa Bluesfest organizers to move the killdeer and its four eggs to a nearby suitable habitat.Mark Monahan, Bluesfest executive director, said an official who has a federal licence to handle migratory birds started work Tuesday evening to move the eggs."We're hopefully going to have the nest and the eggs to a safe location by the end of the day," Monahan said, adding that setup work on the stages should start soon."It's not ideal, but we have enough time," he said. "We may have to work some extra hours, but we should be fine."Environment and Climate Change Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the relocation will allow the nest to remain   and the eggs to hatch   in a natural environment.The bird and its eggs   both of which enjoy protected status in Canada   were nestled on a cobblestone patch that would normally be directly underneath the main Bluesfest stage.Workers came across the killdeer last week when they arrived at the festival venue, which is being set up for a July 5 start date.What the workers described was an agitated bird   the usual defensive habits of an adult killdeer when a threat or intruder has come too close to its nest.Organizers put up yellow caution tape in place around the nest site, and the National Capital Commission paid for 24 hour security on ground overseen by the federal agency.Eggs generally take between 24 and 26 days to hatch, and it is unusual for them not to hatch by mid June.

The Kree/Skrull war is one of the classic Marvel comics storylines; its introduction here is haphazard and less effectively realized than one might expect from something so deeply embedded in Marvel lore. Although the movie might have benefitted from a more detailed exploration of the conflict, time constraints allow for no more than a quick overview. Captain Marvel always seems to be rushing from one set piece to the next, trying to cram too much story into two hours. Characters suffer as a result   Yon Rogg is one dimensional, the members of his team have little definition beyond their physical characteristics, and Maria's introduction is perfunctory.

A poker hand such as JTM JTM 4TM 4TM 9TM , that contains two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank (that match each other but not the first pair), plus any card not of either rank, is called two pair.

If both hands have the same two pairs, the kicker determines the winner, so 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM ATM beats 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM 4TM .

If you're concerned about your son being pulled out for the majority of the day, make sure to address and speak up about his service delivery time. When making an IEP, the services are described as X times per week for X amount of minutes; if you feel that the service delivery their offering is too much, address it. However, I will say, there are many special education teachers that do wonders for students and help close their educational gaps. I don't recall if you mentioned what grade your son is in, but elementary grade special education teachers are able to spend a lot more time with students (small group or 1 on 1), but once your son gets to middle and high school that may change. I'm sure it varies by state, but in my state middle and high schools use the co teaching model where special education teachers attend the core classes and provide service delivery within those classes (no pull out time); this inevitably means that many students do not get all the attention they need, sometimes there are upwards of 15 students in the core class with IEPs and the special education teacher is trying to deliver services to all of them at the same time while the normal class lesson and instructions are being delivered by the gen ed teacher. Just an opinion, if my child was still in elementary school, I would want all the attention he could get while he has the resources elementary schools have. Instructional intensity is one of the most recommended strategies for dyslexia, including more time, smaller groups, targeted at individual reading level, systematic sequence of delivery, extensive opportunity and feedback.

No chops means if 2 players go into a hand where it'll be chopped half the time, lets say 85% tie before the flop is run they agree to chop it and both take half the pot back. A good example of this would be Ace King of Spades vs Ace King of Hearts. The main reason poker players like to chop pots is because they don't want to get it in on a coinflip   poker is about getting the smallest edge possible.

No. In standard poker rules one pair, of any rank, beats an unpaired hand. Perhaps you are thinking of a situation where two people have the same pair, for example a pair of nines, and one has the ace kicker and the other a non ace kicker. Also don't get confused with Lowball, common form Razz, in which the lower valued hands win. In that case an Ace would beat a pair since a pair is a terrible hand to have. No, 1 pair can lose to an ace high, depending on what is on the community table, for instance, if your pair is lower than the 2 pairs on the table, your opponent with an ace high will win.

I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, yes, Bueller is an asshole who has no concerns about anyone else feelings or needs. But he exists as a plot device, a foil to the world around him. Everyone else in the movie is interested in following rules because they are the rules, not the purpose that those rules are actually supposed to serve. You go to work because that what you supposed to do. You go to school because that is what you supposed to do. While his refusal to follow any rules, or to acknowledge the point of said rules does move him firmly into the realm of he there to point out the absurdity of the people around him. I mean, if I actually knew someone like that, I think that person needed to be medicated or arrested. I find it easier to think of him as an idea than a character.

System can increase use of any substance if it suits the user and the user had a reason to want more of the substance. That an across the board thing as applicable to caffeine as it is to crack. Not everyone wants more of the substance they using though, and nicotine isn especially known for ramping up/diminishing returns like crack is. My observation is that most people don increase use of nicotine just because it easy and relatively consequence free to do so. Ever hear of someone ramping up their use of nicotine lozenges/gum? Not so much. I don know about pods, but everyone I know who vapes has to mix their own nicotine into the carrier, so we can easily tweak it up or down in strength, by minute amounts if we like. Over the last few years all of my friends have either lowered their strengths or stayed the same. How often they/we vape is harder to observe but no one observably more thumb sucky than they were before.

We been practicing excited to controlled tug games. I taught him a "give" cue, which I used to reward with food. Now I reward the "give" cue with another game of tug. So I play tug with him, let him get all excited, then I ask for a "give", and, hilariously, I have to wait for him to work himself up to handing it over (he gives the toy tiny little nibbles as he letting go). Then he sits for me, and waits for the "okay!" cue for him to be allowed to play tug again. If he fails any of these steps (doesn give me the toy, tries to grab the toy out of my hand before cued), then we stop playing for awhile. He learned that the reward for that self control (sitting and waiting for the tug toy) is more play, so he motivated to control his excitement.

[W]hat fascinates us [in Oedipus the King] is the spectacle of a man freely choosing, from the highest motives, a series of actions which lead to his own ruin. Oedipus might have left the plague to take its course; but pity for the sufferings of his people compelled him to consult Delphi. When Apollo word came back, he might still have left the murder of Laius uninvestigated; but piety and justice required him to act.

A game may be called $200, 1/2 no limit, which means that the buy in is $200, the blinds are .50 and $1, and the minimum bet the first two rounds is $1 and the last two rounds is $2.

But you can still get burned, for sure.

In all it took us about three months to come up with all the dough to make this happen. Since we're all avid gamblers we went to a few casinos around the Detroit area and made the most of our money.

All cruise guests basically eat the same things: Freezers on board Harmony of the Seas are the size of New York studio apartments, and stocking them is an art form. Before each sailing, the inventory team receives enough ingredients for 20 dining venues, plus servings for the 2,000 member crew. (The total cost, including other consumables such as paper towels, is about $800,000.) Overestimate the order and the voyage becomes less profitable (and wasteful); underestimate and you'll risk a riot over coconut shrimp.

The year 2015 ended with more illusions. Modi's two minute 'whispering' tete a tete with Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the Climate Change Summit in Paris, his foreign minister Sushma Swaraj coming to Islamabad for the Heart of Asia conference and the decision to resume the long stalled India Pakistan dialogue, his out of the blue telephone call from Kabul to Nawaz Sharif and visit to Lahore on December 25, and then within a week a bizarre terrorist 'hold out' at India's Pathankot airbase, all came together in a curious influx of dreamy illusions in India Pakistan logjam. No wonder, questions abound on all these high voltage events..

Ever since the day that I came into this world, kicking and screaming, I wanted to be a hero. My parents supported that decision, with as much love as they could, even if now looking back, I wonder if they really thought that I could do it. That was until the Tyrant King, Azorius did what every evil king had done to heroes every since the start of time. He had them killed. After that a slow steady rage built up inside of me. It consumed me, from the moment that I walked into the Guild, and ended up among a tight group of Adventurers, by the name of Atlas.
The reality is that if they were to get married in Morocco, it could be written in the nikah (marriage contract) that he could have up to 4 wives. But he'd have to be able to show he could afford to have multiple wives (unlikely) and need the permission of any wives he already had before adding another. to be protected by my own laws and when we registered the marriage in Morocco, I made sure that wasn't in the contract you file.

A lot of scum feel comes down to the abilities they use. They use lots of nasty tricks that debuff/disrupt their opponents, vs the rebels and imps that use abilities that mostly boost their own side. That not a hard and fast rule though, since things like Attani Mind Link and Manaroo exist, but it a trend in the faction to debuff rather than buff..

For Marx, our lived experiences  like being a Latina or being a worker  shape what we know and therefore often give us a more accurate sense of what is really going on in the world since a worker or a Latina or a working class Latina sees the world as the ruling classes see it (we all do) and also from her own standpoint and therefore has a double (or triple) consciousness.

As a current RA, I can't tell you what all RA contracts are like but the single room is not guaranteed. The contract I signed specifies that I may have a roommate, but in that case I get paid $5/day, for every day I have a roommate.

Overheating is the primary cause of the Xbox 360 freezing problems. When your Xbox heats up enough it causes the graphics processing unit (GPU) to loosen from the motherboard, and the green lights on your console display three of them in flashing red. The overheated motherboard continues to heat up until it begins to vibrate. The vibrating motherboard in turn loosens the solder joints that hold the GPU in connection to the motherboard circuitry, and the Xbox freezing problem occurs.
My last job I was an inside sales/acct manager rep and one of my customer accounts, who was the industry leader who we catered to at one point, basically became a side account that we only dealt with when convenient within years because they outsourced a huge majority of their company to Latin America AND put them on one of those script based call center programs. I'd speak to the few Outside Salesmen who were from the US and they said it had to have been the single worst thing the company has ever done because the US customers got frustrated with the language/accent barriers and with the scripted service and a bunch of them jumped ship to the 2nd and 3rd place industry leaders.

Science and religion most certainly do not have to be polar opposites "like many Atheists like to declare".

I absolutely agree, 100%. When I was growing up my dad had a friend I called "Auntie David." Auntie David, like my dad, was gay and I knew that but I also knew that he was a drag queen and would sometimes come over wearing makeup and wigs. He bring his box of jewelry, makeup, and feather boas and we play dress up together. That was my first introduction to drag culture. It was normal for me. I a bit older than a lot of the people on Reddit so I still remember seeing RuPaul music videos in the early 90s when I was in elementary school and my dad watched The RuPaul show BUT I was only allowed to watch the introduction and then I had to go to bed. As I got older I was introduced to more drag culture through movies and television (one of the ways I knew my husband was "the one" was when I popped our VHS copy of Priscilla while we were still in high school and he wasn like "oh this is weird.") I have a two year old now and we take her to the children festitivites during pride (they do drag queen story time, "love bubbles" where they have someone come in and blow huge bubbles, that sort of thing) but I don watch Drag Race or queens youtube channels around her because it not really appropriate content for children. I think there also something to be said for people who take their children to drag events but don really do much to support LBGTQIA individuals. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth because they taking from a community for their personal entertainment/gain but not actually doing much to support that community itself buuut that a different soapbox entirely.

For the poker players, the cards are definitely the most exclusive things. So the card covers are certainly going to be considered as exclusive as well. This was not a common scenario even a few years back. People used to have nothing to protect these vulnerable poker cards. Even if they unmindfully bended their cards, it would have been damaged. This was a pathetic thing for the renowned poker players. However, the scenario has changed a lot today as the players have become interested in using all kind of poker products that make their presences more obvious in the casinos around the world. No doubt, a Silver Bud Light Spinner Poker Card Protector is something that makes sure that you look elegant with your poker cards in hand.

A guy doing some work for me recently told me how his son, a Junior, was expelled from public high school last month because he posted, then deleted, a picture on his IG of an overweight black girl in his class eating a bag of Doritos and added the text "Black History Month." It is the only public high school in the area, and he was on the varsity football team.

(which they did to an extend) So comparing it to the "final version" of KH2 makes more sense in my opinion. There should not be much left to add to a full priced game.I also disagree that it always only nostalgia because many fans have replayed the HD versions recently (myself included) and still had a blast which is not exclusively because they played the FM.

"We have a counter here becauseof that; there was a need to monitorthis pollen to give people and hospitalsadvice."

Both economics and retirement planning are prone to making assumptions that all factors remain constant, from the Latin, ceteris paribus, meaning things equal. The problem with this type of linear thinking is that change is the only constant in life, particularly over a long enough time horizon.
I struggled with getting help. It was a long and difficult task that I did without any support or help. 
Button last year negotiated a two year McLaren deal, believed to be worth ( for 2015, for 2016). the lion's share comes in the second year   with a contract break on McLaren's side that would allow it to nullify the contract at the end of the first year. In this way, the team is protected if it feels the driver has under delivered because the team isn't actually committed to anything in year two.
