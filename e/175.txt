As for your top down hierarchic power structure argument that's not what we're talking about. We can have a social democracy where the people control their own fates and power is distributed over the whole population, it doesn't need to be the few wielding power over the many as is inevitable in capitalism.

Salvaging your relationship is 1 so if your husband cannot understand why you feel this way (I believe your emotions are completely valid, even without "proof" that they are more than friends) you really have to evaluate the future of your relationship. Communication is the key and at this current rate, things are only going to go downhill. Things like this start to fester and things start being done and said out of spite.

Have you ever actually talked to a woman about how they feel when a man they met recently cries in public?

So basically after I watched all of this is Jnandez wanted to be part of the nwo wolf pack ( doug, joey, ryan, matt) and Doug (hulk hogan) gave Jnandez(sting) his free t shirt and pat on the back and Jay wasn to happy with that. Thats the rules in the nwo you can speak in broken english. Sounds like the NWO won as the evil Doug (hogan) basically poked Jay(sting) in the eyes and dropped the special leg drop across Jays neck keeping that 100k to rub on his titties. Jay got out his feelings (hope he is finally happy now and can drop this) so hopefully he feels better now( even though hes a millionaire) and can go on back the poker tables and win that 100k back in a few months. ANd for the love of god stop asking people to join your plo site ever 5m when you stream poker. Your stream turned into a plo infomercial every 5m while your playing.

Chavez appropriated those companies to their workers, but then he implemented price controls.What if he hadn done the second part? Would there still be a problem? If you refer to my list of worker cooperatives from my last post, you should have your answer.that tried to provide cheap prices to the people, instead of the for profit method used in the rest of the world.Huh?

The naked chick just literally stayed naked the whole time, giving us lap dances all night, and doing things with bag of stuff off of her body parts. We did these things while drinking until the morning (I took a lot of money from them playing poker but they didn care) until it was just me and the guy who won the money left. Before him and I left to go cash out the chips we had, he began telling me that he is a massive dealer of green stuff, and was interested in having me do that for him as they were from a few hours away and I could cover the area around where I lived at the time. 
If a cheater knew how to cheat, they certainly wouldn't advertise. It is indeed possible to compromise the sites however, and it's been done in the past.

So Wendi and I decided to head back to Turkey from Croatia. Maybe we were starved for the friendliness and hospitality, after a year with the dour Czechs. I can't even begin to explain the hospitality of the Turks. Even the carpet sellers would hassle us to buy carpets and we would tell them, "We don't have jobs or houses, why would we need a carpet?" and they would invite us in for a tea and a chat. And then they would recognize us and talk to us every time we walked by which meant Wendi and I couldn't walk faster than about a mile an hour in the areas of Istanbul we knew. I think the ritual of tea is one reason it's so friendly. Everyone invites everyone else for tea. There are little storefront rooms all around the city where elderly men just brew tea and coffee all day long, and young boys serve as the runners. Local businesses have these "chips" that they give the boys when they arrive with the tea. It's kind of like a system of credit. But I digress

I did try and explain in a few follow up comments that I felt this admittedly desirable quality, going by convention (which is a thing, even if not precisely tangible), probably helped this man get his foot in the door sometimes. I was trying to say I lacked the same advantage he has, and I do think "tallness" is a typically desired trait. Certain good qualities may often allow leverage over less desired qualities, this is a genderless phenomenon, I don know how else to say that really..

I think a good way of looking at it is comparing starting a poker career/hobby to getting a job at McDonalds. If you start from just a baseline level of poker knowledge, or played in the past, how much time would it take studying to get to the point of profitability and then playing to make as much money if you had just been working at McDonalds the whole time? Obviously hard to know exactly but I guess about three years would be a good outcome. It could possibly be two, but anyone who says anything less is certainly wrong imo. And I find two pretty hard to believe. This also relies on the implicit assumption that truly unbeatable bots won be created in that time destroying the ecosystem, which no one can know for sure. And this comparison gets even worse if you replace McDonalds job with a job earning $20 or even $15 an hour.
Yeah I guess that does seem really high for my experience, but coming out of school I had a couple summer internships so I guess that helped. $48k is what, 35k? I guess that why I get confused when people say "you never make money in architecture." It seems that those who complain most on the internet about this profession tend to not do enough in the real world to change their situation. I highly doubt architects like Aravena, Adjaye, Ingles, Herzog de Meuron, and many others that lead projects at Snohetta, OMA, DS+R, etc are wasting their time on Reddit or Archinect talking about how shitty the profession is. 
I suppose that a lot of people who would say "bah humbug" to the plight of the Dickensian poor.

But most of us, a blessed majority of us, finally understand that greed is not good.

I do believe that Everyone deserves a modicum of time devoted to taking care of just themselves. This might just mean time to take a shower for instance.

We got the same problem in our neighborhood. A couple d bags who use their own driveways for storing junk then get irritated at anyone who dares to park on the public road in front of their house. I just always try to put on a smile, show some empathy and joke about all the people and all their stuff being crammed into such a small area and then complain about how hard it is for me to get a spot in front of my own place. (Some mornings my husband and i even brainstorm over coffee what our stories of commiseration will be today should we get caught parked in front of his house again). Won solve the problem, but you can at least claim to be the friendly neighbor "having the same issue and being supportive" while you go about doing whatever you need to do. grumpy people will always find a way to be grumpy. Even when im not agreeing or cooperating, I find my neighbor much less agressive when i verbally empathize with his plight. and with every month that passes, its less and less often that he bothers to gripe or even frown at us anymore. Good luck, crabby neighbors are a bummer!

I get this totally. For me I think it mostly centers around the group of friends I am around. It's like every time I change my circle of friends whether through a change of hobbies or moving to a new place, I start to adapt to which role I play in that group of friends. Then over time I just AM that person. Then I move away again and over time that old person dies and I become a new person. I never notice that change in myself unless I look back over the last 10 15 years and think of the things I've said or done and think about how I would never even have those thoughts now. Especially the motivations of the behaviors.

I think it depends on how the specific hapa woman was raised. Some hapas, even those with Asian mothers, are much more culturally Asian than others. I live in quite a multi cultural city and have met many hapas, there are those who are very Asian, like a girl I knew who had a white father and Japanese mother and she spoke Japanese well, hung out with Japanese friends and had Japanese clothes and food. Which was actually kind of interesting because she was very white passing to the point where I didn even guess she was hapa until she told me. And then on the other hand there are hapas whose Asian parent is second or third generation, who are pretty much removed from their Asian language and culture and don have much attachment to their Asianness. I can only imagine that different hapas have very different experiences of being "Asian". 4 points  submitted 2 days ago

I miss most everything about Colorado. The weather, the activities, the ability to get to anywhere else in the country with a relatively short flight. When you live there you tend to take for granted the outdoors and things like Red Rocks, the Mountains and actual things to do in town and around the area. The Denver area is a bit spoiled when it comes to things like that.
Also there are lot of salty YT comments about the agents being nice to Chris. I get the judgement and believe I not sending CW a Christmas present but people forget that the FBI has spent decades figuring out how to get these criminals to talk.

But right now Asif Zardari seem to have a better hand at the table. And he happens to be a better player too when it comes to political poker. His call to Tahirul Qadri was a master shot to exert pressure on the PML (N).

It was the hope that the Martians receiving the message would figure out the the dots/dashes related to Earth/Mars, finding that "Earth" was equal to their word for Earth (, for example) and "Mars" for (again, for example) their "Dule". And so on. The article is only two pages long and for what its worth it spends a fair amount of space on the description of the apparatus, and a little on what it was that would be transmitted.

Springer became Cincinnati most popular anchor on NBC WLWT TV. Upon leaving the station in 1993, Springer addressed his audience in a very personal commentary that reflected on his past struggles :You see, in political terms as well as human, here in Cincinnati, I was dead.

This is function of the model class and the data distribution. Naively, without using any prior information, you'd say you simply need a lot of data. But this isn't true, and people research finding effective data sets to train on for specific decision boundaries and model classes. Also, if you do need a bunch of data, can you learn as effectively if the data is obfuscated? These are questions Apple is trying to tackle before releasing a feature. Google or Amazon would rather release a feature then peddle back for the sake of privacy.

A core problem in the representative system is that representatives aren bound to their campaign promises (they even allowed to do the opposite of what they promised, and this happens quite often), yet the voters only have campaign promises to base their decision on. It legalized false advertising.
I think my edge still will be my psychology background. I do understand what's going on in a way and with a perspective that poker players don't have. I am an outsider, which is a disadvantage because I don't have as much experience but it's an advantage because I have a different set of eyes and mindset, which I can use.

You know, back in my day when the parents were picking up, the school literally handed out badges for parents to put in their vehicles, like a little thing to go in the dashboard with the kid name and grade.

Well people respected his skill set sure, but the fact that at that point he hadn beaten any top 10 competition and talked about how he one of the greatest made people really not like him. That second coaching stint probably did the most damage to his image in terms of people liking him. Its one thing to ignore your fighter fake tapping (Watch the video its blatant as hell), but to talk all the shit afterwards and allow encourage his fighter to get in the other teams face afterwards and mock them when he fake tapped was abhorrent behavior..

You don't you can't you shouldn't And that said. In the old days, there were many ways of cheating at cards, including fixed decks, cold decks, shiners, strippers, mechanical devices and a variety of dealing and slight of hand tricks. The simplest way is for your partner to simply and covertly inform you of the contents of their hand, and this small amount of information can sway the odds enough to make a difference.

And even then, you don know. Maybe a person can be vegan and have avocado every day, excluding themselves from the chain of suffering that the meat industry personifies, but maybe it because some hundreds of acres of tropical forest have been destroyed and converted in avocado farmland and maybe just one or two indigenous communities have been displaced to do so or forced to work for mostly nothing, in any case affecting their society maybe for generations, maybe forever. There are no simple answers unless you are a six year old..

The bring in must be at least the required minimum amount agreed upon before the game.

The bracelet events kick off with an 1,100 version of the WSOP's "Monster Stack" event with three starting flights, and a 550 version of the WSOP Colossus that carries a 2 million guarantee with an eye toward setting the record for largest live tournament field in European history. The schedule is otherwise similar to previous iterations of WSOP Europe with one major exception   the inclusion of a 111,111 High Roller for One Drop, paralleling it's Las Vegas counterpart. That tournament alone, with a field capped at 111 players, carries a 10 million guarantee.

I done my research and know all the great things SLC has to offer. I work in tech, so the employment landscape is of course a big part of the appeal. The cost of living, less traffic, and seasonal weather instead of an epic burning summer are all factors, too. We loved our 10+ years in Austin, but are ready to experience something new and really are hoping to take advantage of the beauty and outdoors of SLC. We have small children that we like to raise with a little more space, etc. I okay with less options for restaurants and music, saying goodbye to SXSW and Franklin BBQ. And I excited to contribute to a new city the way I have for Austin: volunteering, joining boards, voting, buying memberships to museums, zoos, supporting local businesses and nonprofits, and all of that.

If going to the Swiss clinic that offers injections of live sheep placenta cells is too dclass for you, maybe you'll be interested in this: CNN reported in 2008 that a Beverly Hills skin center was offering treatments using human placentas, obtained from Russian maternity wards, for $350 to $500 a session. While there doesn't seem to be much hard scientific evidence, proponents of placenta based beauty treatments claim that it does wonders for sun and acne ravaged skin [source: Yvkeff]. The practice seems to have originated in Asia. A Singapore company called Maylande markets a facial treatment made from human placentas that it obtains in Japan. Its placenta based products include a tonic, a soap, a facial mask and others, which it claims provide a range of benefits, from clear skin to brain stimulation [source: Maylande].

What about when it's a bus full of children going to school (because that happened)? Again, we've abandoned the presumption of innocence (the very foundation of our criminal justice system and a basic human right) and forced the dead to somehow prove their innocence posthumously for essentially the crime of living in the wrong region. And this was done not to capture or kill terrorists, but so that the government could lie about how many civilians they were illegally killing. This in no way enhanced the efficacy of the drone program, it just made it more politically and socially palatable.
Once it has exported the finished AVI, open AVIdemux and drag and drop your AVI file into the AVIdemux window. The format you want to use is up to you, personally I like h265/MP4. Under "Video Output", change it from "Copy" to "HEVC (x265)", and under "Output Format", change to "MP4 Muxer". Also if you want to add music you can do it here by going to Audio > Select Track and loading in the audio you want (make sure it matches the length of the video or it get cut off).

But walking improves your overall health in an even more important way: If you do it briskly (at a rate of between three and five miles per hour) and continuously for at least 20 to 30 minutes, it becomes an aerobic exercise. An exercise is aerobic if you can do it rhythmically and continuously and at a brisk enough pace to force your heart and lungs to work harder to supply your major muscles with oxygen. By forcing your cardiovascular system to pump blood and oxygen continuously throughout your body, aerobic exercise stimulates and strengthens the heart, lungs, and muscles..

Don call large open sizes. People on this sub post hand histories showing them calling 5x open raises with things like 89s, but this is a clearly losing play for multiple reason; you don have the required equity to call preflop, people behind you can still re raise and force you to fold your initial call, and you will be on the wrong end of "coolers" like straight over straight or flush over flush. Just fold pre and 3bet/4bet when you have strong hands.

I personally recommend trying a different moisturizer. The Neutrogena has a ton of silicone in it which can be good for some skin types (dry, normal) but it can potentially be problematic for others (oily, acne prone). Oily skin already has excess amounts of sebum in the pores and when you add dimethicone on top of that, it can cause clogged pores and breakouts.

The only thing missing for me is that real life investigation is full of false leads and ambiguous evidence, and this feels very linear by comparison. It's fine if you want it that way, but I think the framework can also be extended for things like that. There could be different branches, with it known to players that one is "right", the other "wrong", with different consequences, but they don't know which is which. Maybe there was a bandit also named Lord Zog 50 years ago, and if they follow that branch, they can find Zog's hoard but have lost valuable time for stopping the cult.

Treats? A common exercise to help new dogs learn their name is to say their name, drop a treat, say their name, drop a treat, etc. Once they anticipate the treat, you start waiting for them to look at you and then give a treat (might not be possible with Monty if he doesn make eye contact). In this way, you train that their name means "pay attention.".

I mean, I don personally think f!Byleth costume is really wildly sexual so much as it just got a bunch of of baffling design choices, like they wanted it to be kind of sexy but couldn really pull it off. But the point I making is firstly that if male characters aren designed with being attractive as the first priority then female characters shouldn be, and secondly that a lot of female sexualization is uncomfortable and denigrating to women while a lot of male sexualization is generally respectful to men. If m!Byleth can have a reasonable costume that both men and women can enjoy, then there is no reason f!Byleth should not, especially because they pretty much the same character.

She is dismissive of a claim made in Behind Sad Eyes, a recent, unofficial biography of Harrison by Marc Shapiro, that when George first met Olivia at a party in 1974, he had her "checked out" by investigators before they began dating.

Then he was playing great at the beginning of this season, but got injured again (along with Subban, Forsberg, Arvidsson, Smith, Sissons, Salomaki, Rinaldo and some others I sure I forgetting   who were all out for extended periods since December/January at the same time) and has been completely invisible since he returned.I will say it not only him. Most of the players who returned from injury have been playing poorly since they returned, most noticeably Forsberg. Still, it seems like we only gotten about a good 3 4 months of solid hockey from him since he was traded to us last season.I recommend a 340i or 440i, cheaper than m2. And get a burger tune on it for cheap and hella power. Get m sport packages on both. Also m240i is also a good alternative if you want smaller sports car, it faster than 2017/18 m2 but with awd. Beamer engines have great mod support. And their cars have hella aftermarket. Cheaper to maintenance than m2 probably. B58 engines are pretty reliable.Used s4 and tune or a4 and tune. Make sure to get quattro versions.C43 amg, it good but its eh.

Granted neither should Gring's. but if you're making the claim that there's evidence of something two sides saying different things doesn't constitute evidence.

I was more saying it's very unclear what actually happened versus the top comment saying it was definitely the nazis.

A lot of people are talking about how they probably changed their diet intentionally either to feel good about their workout or to match the fact that they are exercising.

I work for insurance companies, and generally, it is different. Most carriers adopt a scoring model from a third party in the insurance industry that generates a "credit based insurance score." My understanding is it is based on the information you'd see in a credit report, but weighted differently to more heavily reflect the indicators for risk when it comes to insurance. Generally, I'd say it can't hurt to reach out and try to run a new score; my previous company would apply the new one if it improved and keep the old one if it had gone down.

I was raised in a denomination that said that all you had to do to get into heaven was to accept Jesus into your heart as your personal lord and savior. My denomination rejected the notion of unforgivable sins, or the need for confession.

I don believe in God, but if I did, what loving God would set up silly rules like that???

I do not know who mandated validation of tasks,(12.3.11) but the result is a real hardship resulting in hours of staff time. Perhaps someone thought that HODs would thoughtfully consider each task and link the task to appropriate topics/skills. In this province at least, the school has little control over what skills are evaluated by each task. That is decided by the DOE. So what happens at the school is that some poor soul must spend days going through each task of each subject for each grade and mindlessly linking each task to all the skills. There is already great resistance to using SAMS for recording marks. This just provides one more disincentive for recording marks in the system.

Our Mori children   I went into politics to help our nation remember how to love our children. It is time to correct the disparity that exists between Mori and Pkeh   between indigenous New Zealanders and those descended from European settlers.

I want our children to know how great they are   to stand up and embrace the greatness of their ancestors and their achievements.

The effect is not something you can defeat with good thoughts. Chocolate is a hyperpalatable food, meaning it high in sugar and fats. This triggers your stone age brain to go "You need to eat this.

It incredibly hard to stop eating chocolate once you started, crisps are the same in that regard.
I am not in any way a medical professional but has anyone tested your thiamin levels? I had gastric sleeve done and about 8 months later I had a lot of these symptoms. I could not keep food down or it would pass through me so fast I was running to the toilet with horrific diarrhea in minutes. I would lay on the bathroom floor in the fetal position and cry. I couldn't walk from my car into work without stopping to use the bathroom several times or to catch my breath. I would sweat profusely, but shiver because I was cold. I honestly thought I was dying. I'd had a lap band converted into a sleeve so I didn't have a ton of weight to lose, I'd just been previously having issues with acid reflux. But I lost over 20 lbs in a month. My surgeon recognized my symptoms as beriberi, which is basically unheard of in developed countries because of our access to enriched white flour and variety of foods. I now take a daily thiamin supplement because my high potency multi vitamin wasn't enough. So it may be worth having that looked at as well.
