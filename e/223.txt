The defining aspect of reality TV is probably the manner in which it is shot. Whether the show takes place in a real setting with real people (much like a documentary), shoots in front of a live studio audience that participates in the program, or uses hidden surveillance, reality TV relies on the camera capturing everything as it happens. In this article, we'll learn about what constitutes reality TV today, the types of reality programs, when they got to be so popular   and if they're all as "real" as they claim to be.

Garlan the motherfucking Gallant is straight up one of the best dudes to show up in the books. When Tyrion is basically persona non grata in Joffrey court, Garlan is the only person to publicly honour him for his role in the Blackwater defence. When Joffrey is trying to humiliate Tyrion, Garlan stands up for him and disparages Joffrey behaviour, in front of everyone.

At my former full time position (got a new full time and bumped myself down to part time there), the manager had us do a run through of the store to see if there were any lingering customers. I found one chilling in movies, on his phone. Mind you, we made 15, 10, and 5 minute announcements, and this guy just chatters his way through, looking for a movie.

He hears me, turns around, hangs up, stutters an apology, and bolts for the front door.

Reddit has a way of taking what feels like shallow internet courtesy on other social media in the form of "likes" and occasionally comments and makes them feel a lot more real.

But on here I get a sense of validation and feel like people are actually reading what I have to say to understand and not just to reply or make a weak ass joke or just agree with me. I've never gotten any of this from Twitter, FB or IG.

It just that they didn foresee the development of the service and information sector, which has largely replaced farming and then industry as a primary employer. They were actually completely correct that those jobs would largely be relegated to the history books. Human muscle was mostly replaced but they still needed more human brains than ever to manage this ever increasingly rapid and complex world.

If new sectors that we can imagine spring up, computers will take those too because we have nothing to offer that they do not.

The Tantra Massage is a technique developed by Andro Andreas Rothe, the founding father of the first German Tantra institute (Diamond Lotus Tantra Lounge, in Berlin since 1977). The male prostate massagers massage the lobes that surround the prostate gland resulting in its voluntary contraction. It's also seen, in lots of circumstances, that a mild massage of the prostate flushes out bacteria which might be trapped inside the prostate glands. The prostate gland could possibly be referred to as the male G spot and this prostate massager is accessible with a ribbed shaft and has a constructed in microchip. This microchip controls the three totally different vibration settings of the massager. The perineum stimulating stainless steel ball is the defining characteristic of this prostate massager. Setting the mood of the room previous to the massaging is as vital as massage itself.

Since poker became the "big game" in Las Vegas, many people are buying chips for home play. An interesting way to do it is to literally buy them from the casino and take them home with you. Use them for your home games, and if you ever stop playing, or need the money, cash them back in at the casino you got them from for full value. Don't worry about the changes a casino may make, or even the possibility of a casino being sold or closed down. This would only make your Las Vegas casino poker chips even more valuable

The signals from your cut hand travel into the spinal cord through the dorsal roots. There, they make synapses on neurons within the dorsal horn (the top half of the butterfly shaped gray matter).

His quality of life has been one of the things I have felt the most guilt over. I feel like we didn give him enough attention while he was alive, our dog sometimes policed him and try and keep him away from us. We would often times tell our dog to be nice and remove her from the couch and let the cat sit with us, but sometimes he would have already left due to her. We also would hang out in our office with the door closed to keep heat in and sometimes he would just be alone in the rest of the house. He was very finicky about being stuck in a room, sometimes we hear him meowing and let him in, and then he immediately want out and start meowing at the door to be let out. Because of this sometimes we didn bother letting him in because he want out within less than a minute. I know cats are more solitary, but I still feel bad about it.

As far as Atlantis goes I know the commonly accepted theory is that Plato was talking about a fictional place. A couple of comments are saying he explicitly stated that in the book? I don remember that part, but it has been awhile so I def double check. But there are also older maps that show Atlantis in the NW part of Africa right below the Atlas Mountains. Near there is a natural formation called the Richat structure or the "Eye of the Sahara". It looks pretty interesting in google earth. It is not too hard to imagine before a large climate shift/Catastrophe that its lower lying rings could have been filled with water and connected to a waterway that could easily access the ocean. Plato does have quite a fairly amount of detailed information that he said was passed down to him from Solon and was originally in an Egyptian temple documenting the history of Atlantis. The description matches word for word to the site with fairly eerie accuracy from what I can tell. For example the 3 colors of the stones in the city. On the ground at the Richat there is rubble everywhere with those 3 exact colors. There are also specific distances in Plato account when he talks about the layers of the city and it ring like shape. They match really well with this natural structure. I not sold on the Atlantis part, but it is really really fun.

So true. My first baby was born at 35 weeks in our apartment because I didn realize I was truly in labor in the beginning. How could I not notice I was really in labor? Because my water didn break like in the movies   it was a trickle. Plus, every single pregnancy book and class said to expect first labors to be close to 24 48 hours.

If I play well and get a bit of luck, hopefully I can go a long way into the World Series main event."

It like in school, you could tell when kids went through their paper and replaced a word in each sentence with something from the thesaurus that they never use in real life, but this looks like just about every single word was taken from some corporate speak handbook. 
The smallish crowd of about 400 was doing its own worshipping   if not Stapp, then certainly his message. They whooped and cheered throughout the show. And when Stapp said that the song "Surround Me" was, in retrospect, a prayer, someone shouted, "Amen!" introduced "One" by saying, "The only way is one, my friends," and it had a nice, faster pace. When Stapp saw people who were trying to dance getting directed to the side of the theater by security, he said, "Come on, get out of your seats!"

Overall if I had to choose again I would probably still go to UH for engineering as some of the professors really make it worth it and the experience itself overall I think was quite good.

Most people tend to be pretty satisfied with the laws of intestate succession (basically the default rules of where your stuff goes), while wills are for people who want to customize the distribution of their estate upon death.

Berati touched a concealed bell embedded in the top of his desk. Almost immediately, through a door which Fawley had not previously noticed, a young man entered, noiseless and swift in his movements and of intriguing personality. His head was shaven like the head of a monk, his complexion was almost ivory white, unrelieved by the slightest tinge of colour. His fingers were bony. His frame was thin. The few words he addressed to his Chief were spoken in so low a tone that, although Fawley's hearing was good and Italian the same to him as most other languages, he heard nothing. To his surprise, Berati introduced the newcomer.

Metroid Fusion (GBA)Still a good game, but a big disappointment after playing ZM. I don't mind linear games but in that case I really prefer it if it just cut out the exploring and backtracking altogether and stuck to a stage based structure.

It wasn an especially intense pain, but I injured my back a couple of years ago, herniated disc was pinching a nerve in my spine sent constant paid through my left buttock and leg. It was a long dull ache, for about six weeks no matter how I wriggled or writhed, no matter what position I tried to rest in, I could never get away from it. I couldn even sleep, I might doze off for 20 40 minutes but the pain would always wake me up and force me to shuffle around trying to do something about it.
