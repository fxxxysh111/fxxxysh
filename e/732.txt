And to me, it is the dehumanization and the silencing of a particular pain and suffering of people, should not be ok and normal. And you can't be in the practice of humanizing and uplifting the suffering of one, if you're not willing to do that for everyone.

I never go to the dark place of saying "here's a Jewish person, they're talking about Palestinians, Palestinians are Muslim, maybe they're Islamophobic." I never allow myself to go there because I don't have to.

The odds don change but the strategy can based on the situation.

Likewise, 90% of American commercial animation is funded by American companies, made within the Hollywood network of western companies and creators, etc. Same for China, and same for the smaller industries like Thailand and Russia.

There are two extremes you can swing between when rehabbing and flipping a home: the "I have to have it   this house is the ONLY house" extreme, and the "Nah, something better will always come along" extreme. Both ends of the spectrum are dangerous. If you're SO invested in a house that you HAVE to have it, it will be easily read on your face. You may as well write "Take advantage of me" in felt tip pen on your forehead, while you're at it. On the other hand, if you're so preoccupied with finding the BEST deal that you sacrifice many good, profitable deals along the way, you'll not only miss out on opportunities but you'll end up too confused to think straight by the end of it all. Keep it simple: find one good deal and see it through.

The Strata Property Act establishes the change must be significant and applies to use or appearance, but how does a council determine what is significant?A straightforward test on the proposed change is helpful. Will the change in use alter the ability of owners, tenants or guests to access the facility? Is the change short term only to address a maintenance or safety issue or is this a policy change in use? How will everyone be affected by the change? Will the change result in other occupants being affected adversely?If you are planning a change in use or appearance, there may be other considerations. A removal of a tree or group of plantings may affect the appearance, as well as the use of the property, and may affect privacy.

If he was asked to bowl 14 or 15 overs in a Test, you might get him to change his mind. But to bowl 15 to 20 with his action is too many."

The video prompted strong responses both for and against when it was posted to social media. It has since been taken down.Since it was posted to the Facebook page of the Pacific Balance Pinniped Society earlier this week, a debate has erupted over the safety of sea lions and other creatures, as well as the safety of fishing crews struggling to make a living in challenging times.The society says it is trying to save salmon stocks by lobbying for a commercial harvest of harbour seals and sea lions on the west coast. Several scientists have disputed the claim that culling pinnipeds would help salmon stocks and warn that a cull would have consequences for the complex food web.Marsden said there a double standard if someone fishing on a river can use a banger to scare a bear, but he can do the same at sea.Three years ago, he said he was attacked by a sea lion while working on his boat.Gina Anderson shot photos of a sea lion dining on a four foot sturgeon in the Fraser River on Feb. 
"Surrogacy is the new adoption," says Delhi fertility doctor Anoop Gupta.Similar surrogacy tourism is happening around the world, in the and even in rural, white areas in the US like the one where I work, poor women carry the children of the urban upper classes in exchange for $8 10,000.Again, what if the situation were reversed? if science showed what many of us suspect to be true: the upper classes, like purebred dogs, are more prone to neuroses and even, perhaps, psychoses as well as a host of rich peoples diseases like gluten intolerance? if rich women were forced to be the surrogates for poor women so the poor women could continue to work and then the poor women would raise the child in the seemingly healthier environment of knowing that life is not about "happiness" and the project of eternal youth?So now we have heterosexual couples with money renting the wombs of poor women so they can have the full rights and benefits of being married and, perhaps more importantly, reproductive.But if modern love says reproductive and married is good, it does not think that reproductive and married is good if it same sex.

Your to do list is likely getting super long at this point, and I'm sorry if this feels overwhelming. But people like your mom operate out of the same playbook, generally, and this is stuff that, taken care of as a preventative measure, will make things easier in the long run. It will form a wall for her to run into, and that's a lot better than waiting for a mess that will need cleaning up.

"The clubs that are steaming ahead are those that are thoroughly modern, in touch with their members and are diversifying to a greater extent," Mr Ball said. Warilla Bowls and Recreation Club and Oak Flats Bowling and Recreation Club, which amalgamated with Illawarra Yacht Club earlier this year, provide two very different examples of diversification in the industry. This December, the Warilla club will open the doors to its $6.3 million revamp, which is the result of 18 months of strategic planning.

10 points  submitted 11 days agoWe dated for a while, and still hooked up occasionally after "breaking up." Although she was conventionally only just above average in looks the way she carried herself, talked, acted and just existed made me fall head over heels for her.After being together as a couple/"friends" for eight months she went overseas to finish her degree (she was taking a gap year after some messed up stuff happened to her) and although we talked less we were still affectionate (in a non sexual way) with each other.I met up with her over the summer and she made it quite clear from the start that she wanted to be friends, not "friends" with all the sexual intimacy that came with being "friends." She wanted to hook me up with a friend of hers and I ended up dating her friend for the past 8 or so months.I want to see her as just a friend but to be honest I still have quite a lot of feelings for her.So what am I doing? I not talking to her, at least not for now.

Chris DysonThe biggest winners in our historically close election may yet be problem gamblers. Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie is pushing for the introduction of a $1 maximum bet on poker machines. The commission itself concluded that if you're not lucky enough to win the free games feature, "it is easily possible to play 19 button pushes per minute". As things stand in NSW, you can lose $10 with every one of those pushes. That's not to say people don't love their clubs. That's not to say clubs don't do a world of good for society through services, junior sport development, community sponsorship, supporting volunteers and myriad other good deeds. That's true. No doubt, internet gambling is a huge problem that is only going to get worse.

2 It good to have a minimal loss system. Instead of buying into 1/3 losing and buying in again, start with 80 100 on 1/2. Once you have built your stack to $250, move on to 1/3. If you lost on 1/3, go back to 1/2 with 80 100 (Crowns 1/2 max is 100). This way you are learning to win more than you lose and though it wont feel good to dwindle a big stack, too many dwindle their bankroll/paycheck.

And like I said this response is for those more sympathetic to the Gaudiya cause rather than a direct shastric response. Most of Gaudiya philosophy rests upon the divinity of Mahaprabhu, and if people aren willing to accept the shastric praman brought in support of that, its impossible to have any form of debate regarding it.But I don't find it surprising that people attack Prabhupada's character since he himself was very disrespectful towards many teachers and even Gods.

The fact that this guy managed to make up a story about 2 white men in MAGA hats, wandering around Chicago at 2AM, one of the most liberal cities in the country, carrying bleach and a rope, and not a single person either stopped them or called the cops, should have been a gigantic Tiannamen level square flag. The "This is MAGA Country" they supposedly yelled, or the fact that the attack just happened to occur out of sight of cameras, or the fact that these racists somehow recognized a black, gay man who has a supporting role in a show with a majority black cast was WAY too much. Add in the fact that it was  20 in Chicago that night (fun aside: bleach freezes at 18 degrees) and it sounds like bad fan fiction.
