The few things I would do in folded mode on small screen is to accept calls, read messages on the go, maybe peek at emails. That is it. If I am not walking, the phone will be in tablet mode. Really don need anything more from the front display, I wouldn mind if it would be even smaller. I could imagine if it would be moved to the top and have more space on bottom for a qwerty case or something like that. On the other hand, I don really mind the Huawei design either, it is just right in the promo video (and we did not yet see the Fold in such lighting conditions that would tell us if Fold has the same "problem or not), the Huawei is not really completely flat, and there seems to be some bumps and kinda like bubbles which would point to the fact the glass is really just a thin film. So one particular day there another gay guy in the van, in our row. I was at the window, ex was beside me, and gay guy was beside him. So we were both napping (really really early morning) while holding hands. Then I woke up and saw that gay guy was also napping (or pretending) and his hand was on my guy leg. I didn know what to do there and my ex was near his stop anyway so I woke him up and he had to get down the van. Gay guy and me were left and I was side eyeing him hard.

Where to Meditate Chose somewhere that you can sit comfortably, with your thighs parallel with the floor and your back vertical. You can sit in an upright chair (try propping the back legs up on something to help the spine rest vertically). You can sit with pillows propping you up on a bed. The key is for the spine and head to be balanced. When you sit down, spend a few seconds imagining that there is a thread of light pulling you gently up by the crown of your head and let the rest of your spine find its own place.

1. Hold 'em Each player is first dealt two cards down. A round of betting occurs as players decide for the first time if they are in or they're out. Then five community cards follow with betting after the flop, the turn, and the river. In the end, the best five card combination wins the hand and takes the pot.

When your blind is raised, consider the pot odds carefully and almost never fold getting 1.5 to 1 or better. For calling with longer odds, the best hands to call with are two aces, ace + low + face card, and big pair + two low cards. In general at the end you should lean toward calling very loose, as well as reraising all in often against opponents that may make a terrible fold.

It also helps when you're in an area with limited options. Generally the people who have a lot of money (doctors, lawyers etc ) refuse to play the lowest limits available at the casino. They feel it's beneath them. This leads to the people with the most disposable income playing 2/5 which juices the game. The 2/5 player pool where I play is 30% regs and the rest are people shot taking from 1/2, people waiting to play PLO and people with a lot of money. In my opinion it's much more profitable because of this. The 1/2 players are trying to play tight so they don't go bust, the plo players are fun because they are ready to gamble and the guys with money are usually arrogant enough to think they have an edge in the game or are just there to have fun.

The convenience that online poker gives players is simply unbeatable. Being able to play no matter what time it is can really make people love the game even more. A lot of people don't have much time in the day with all the chores to do. So, some people find it better to play in the middle of the night or whenever their busy schedule clears. They don't need to waste time by driving to a casino in order to play. All they have to do is turn on their computers and log on to their favorite poker site.
Counting Turnover and RevenueTurnover can be counted by calculating incoming revenue, such as when inventory turning over brings in sales income. But inventory turnover can also be evaluated in other terms, such as the amount of time it takes you to sell the stock you typically have on hand. In this instance, a turnover cycle is measured in terms of percentage of total inventory being sold and the time it takes to sell it.

A cash game is not a tournament so you have all the time in the world to play the right hand with the right timing at the perfect spot. Blinds are similar and always there so you can always get another stack or rebuy if you want. This means you do not have to take chance on making a double. So, skip bad hands and play tight in a cash game.

Me give you one example. In translation. The ribosome assembles as a small subunit and a large subunit, and the messenger RNA is sandwiched between them. When the ribosome moves along the mRNA, the large and small subunits twist relative to each other in a ratchet motion physically pulling itself along the mRNA. In order to see this happening, researchers took advantage of the fluorescent molecules called cy3 and cy5 as probes. These small molecules emit light of different wavelengths. The researchers attached one probe to the large subunit and one to the small subunit. Then then took advantage of what called FRET or Forster Resonant Energy Transfer where shining light on one probe causes the probe to fluoresce light, but if it is close enough to the second probe (like angstroms distance) instead of fluorescing light, the energy excites the second probe and it emits light at its own wavelength. Knowing this, hand having special equipment to do these experiments, the researchers could watch as the light emitted from probe one would flick on and off, and the light from probe two would flick off and on in sequence. There are differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes including the translation of the triplet code that you need to be aware of to optimize your experiments for your system of preference.

Reduction of depression (two studies): Both studies found improvements in depressive mood. Gentle touch massage showed more favourable results than foot massage but no differences were reported when compared with full body massage (one study). Inclusion criteria were specified adequately. Various relevant data sources were accessed. Language and publication restrictions might mean that studies were missed and the relative biases could not be ruled out.  and quality assessment were carried out with attempts to minimise error and bias; it was unclear whether similar steps were taken for data extraction. Appropriate quality assessment checklists were specified; although apparently used as a study selection tool, the results of this assessment were not presented. Study details were presented. These demonstrated high variation among the interventions and outcome measures and suggested that the method of synthesis was appropriate.

YTA a thousand times over. Your sister got up and did something pretty difficult.

But no, your reaction is totally vain, selfish, and vindictive. She your sister for fucks sake! You totally the asshole.

I think it's terrific that she finally faced some very real consequences for her lifetime of raising and coddling her GCJN piece of crap, while terrorizing the lives of her well meaning "good" kids so GCJN could have an "easy" life. She fully earned every bit of that phenomenally stupid foreclosure, and really, she needs to be on her own now. Whatever social services has to offer for housing, that's what she gets. I really, really hope that DH isn't guiltily holding on to responsibility for helping out his Moooooommy when she encounters hardships late in life. She didn't earn it. At all. She, and GCBIL, did earn every bit of the bad fortune and consequences that are finally coming their way, after a lifetime of abusing the rest of the family. Let those consequences stand.

If morals are on, I can see moments of hesitation with most of these heros. The military could capture the MCUs loved ones dopplegangers (the ones available) or hostages, and use psychological warfare. The MCU would tire before they can defeat the ENTIRE military. It's simply too much manpower.

A high dynamic range video feed on an HDR TV set should have more vibrant images with better contrast than non HDR 4K TV sets. But there's a catch   you need an HDR video source to take advantage of the image boost you get with an HDR TV. At the moment, there aren't many options. Plus, there are different HDR coding standards battling it out behind the scenes: HDR 10 and Dolby Vision are the two main opponents. The two standards aren't compatible, and if your TV only supports one you won't be able to take advantage of the content using the other.

In college one night I was cross faded; most fucked up I been my entire life. I stumble into my apartment, and decide I want to sit down. Instead of the couch 3 feet away, I push the TV to the back of the table and sit down where the TV usually is. Then, I started staring at the couch for a solid ten seconds and in the pitch black dark, at 3 in the morning, all by myself, I said out loud, "So this is what it like to be a TV." After that I realized I had way to much and went to sleep immediately before I hurt myself

In September, The Sunday Age had applied for access to the foundation annual reports under an obscure disclosure provision of Victoria Fundraising Act.

However, one notable experience I had in recent memory, I was looking for my wallet. I couldn find it anywhere.

Poker games have been around for a long time and used to evoke images of a small group of men sitting around a small table stuck in the back of a garage or basement with the inevitable tapestry of dogs playing poker on the wall above them. Poker has become even more popular recently and it is now not uncommon for a large group to get together for a full night of tournaments and cash games once a week or more. One of the biggest changes has been the inclusion of women into what was once thought of as a mostly male activity. The game has become so popular that ladies poker nights are beginning to pop up everywhere.

Give me a break, "cheaper form of slavery"? Most slaves were provided with little more than a wooden shack and the ability to grow their on food to survive. Comparing that to a system that pays skilled, voluntary laborers with a competitive wage established by market values, health insurance benefits, retirement fund matches, paid vacation, life insurance, and a myriad of other forms of compensation to slavery is ignorant and insensitive to those who suffered under slavery. Also, I think you are confusing libertarians with anarchists.

I personally prefer the Monologue to the Minilogue, but that personal taste, both are fantastic. $300 ish is too high for a Monologue, pretty sure $300 will grab a brand new one if I remember correctly. Used ones are pretty consistently going for around $200 lately from what I seen, bought a floor model with no scuffs and box and all for $200 about 6 months ago. $350 is a pretty good price for a Minilogue, I usually see them going for just shy of $400.

Cards: The saying "you get what you pay for" couldn't be more true than when it comes to purchasing poker cards. Every poker supply store will sell you "cut" or "stamped" cards real cheap. These are cards that were used by a casino and have been retired. They usually come from the blackjack tables and have seen only 5 6 hours of play. But, these cards will get bent and marked quite easily. I suggest you stick with Bicycle brand plastic playing cards, or if you want to go for the professional feel, search for KEM or Copag cards. These are plastic cards that will not be ruined if a drink is spilled on them, they take back their original shape after being bent and are a solid investment for long term use. These cards will cost you $10 $15 per deck but will save you money in the long run as you won't be replacing them several times per night like you would with the cheap cards.

So how does one prepare to take on a tri? As the popularity of the sport grows, so does the training community expanding around it. Unlike athletes who focus on one area such as running or cycling, triathletes tend to move in groups. Covering miles upon miles on long training rides can be tedious alone, and open water swimming in a group is much safer than hitting the waves by yourself. Since most people are less likely to flake out on their training routine when there are others around to encourage them onward, the motivation and encouragement from a group can spur better performances and help athletes get to the finish line without burning out.

As I am all for a bit of help when it comes to giving parents information on useful sites to block and with younger kids I would definitely monitor them a whole lot more. When they hit their teens though and can just access this stuff anyway they still need to know the reasons why we as adults (mainly) don view gore/snuff/ISIS videos or else they will just look it up on whatever fringe website will host it. Unless you think that you can convince teens to just accept an internet banning as well, which would never fly.

Cupping involves placing glass, bamboo or plastic jars on the skin and creating a vacuum by suctioning out the air. The underlying tissue is raised, or sucked, partway into the cup. The purpose of cupping is to enhance circulation, help relieve pain, remove "heat" and pull out the toxins that linger in your body's tissues. You usually will feel a tight sensation in the area of the cup. Often, this sensation is relaxing and soothing. As the name implies, in this method your practitioner applies massage oil or cream on your skin in selected places, puts the cups over the areas to be treated and then slides them around that region of the body   most commonly the back. The cups slide easily because the cream has lubricated your body. You ought to consider exploring the benefits of cupping if you seek relief from stress, pain, allergies, fatigue, flu, colds, back pain, anxiety, muscle aches, red itchy skin conditions or fever.

Similar type of professor so my plan was to show up an hour early. Just my luck I got pulled over for a random smog check. (I didn know that was a thing either.) As a part of some kind of environmental initiative they were pulling over random cars and making them do smog checks on the side of the road which was going to take over an hour because there was a line of cars they already pulled over. I begged the cop to let me go, and I even promised to return after my final but the best the cop could do was give me a little business card explaining I was detained for an hour for this random check. I got to the final only 5 minutes late and the doors were already closed and locked. I had to show my card from the police to the TA, who took me to the professor through a back way. They both looked pretty skeptical about the card but I argued that coming to class one hour ahead of time was a reasonable precaution and that I couldn control the police. So he let me take the final but had to throw in there that I would not be given extra time to make up for being late.

Why don they support comprehensive sex education in schools and easy access to contraception, things that would dramatically decrease the amount of unwanted pregnancies?.

The second half of this problem was the immense amount that was being bought online by underaged users with a credit car mommy and daddy gave them, and then they ignored the bill for.

4) For me, I like to always carry a sniper so I can see farther as I travel, then I like having an assault rifle in my second slot and an smg/shotgun in the third. This means as opponents get closer I wheel mouse down, and having a gun for every range is nice. I always upgrade for color, but I find the AK47 does the most damage for ARs, the Pump does the most damage for shotguns, and i like the P90 for smgs, so i prioritize those over others. I like the bolt sniper and hate the VSS (very shitty sniper). Only grab a pistol or anything gray if it the only thing you can get and upgrade immediately, Don carry two ARs, but you can pick them up because you get extra ammo. I sometimes exchange the sniper for a specialty gun, like Rubber or minigun. They sometimes seem OP against bad players but good players will kill you every time, so it depends on who you run into. Miniguns have crazy range but are easy to defend against and take forever to reload. Basically you always want a long, medium and short range weapon and 1 2 heals.

Physiotherapy students at Nottingham provide fantastic opportunities for students helping them to gain experience in many area of physiotherapy to advance their skills in ways which may not be possible elsewhere. For a number of years the students have helped out giving post massages at sporting events such as The Robin Hood Marathon and various Touch Rugby events. This year, two lecturers took 19 students who volunteered their time to help treat injuries, strapping/tapping and provide massage to 20 teams. The experience gained was huge with a variety of interesting injuries being treated, acute and chronic, including a suspected ankle fracture, subluxed glenohumeral joint, thumb and finger sprains as well as partially ruptured muscles. The donations received from the event totalled

In 2000, one of my favorite directors made a film that he deemed his "love letter to rock music." Cameron Crowe spent his younger years as a reporter for Rolling Stone Magazine, covering some of the most notable acts of the 1970s. Almost Famous was a movie filled with classic music, memorable scenes, and great acting. Even though most of the actors weren't ones whom might be called "A listers," the ensemble cast was unforgettable.
But don't count on that pampering just yet, because while the good news is that this is doable, the bad news is that the techniques require lots of training, even actual exercise. 
It is easy to understand how this occurred because the units are not consecutive building by building. That appears to be the root of the problem. My recommendation is to immediately correct the strata plan unit entitlement for this fiscal year as it relates to each strata lot and unit number and talk to your lawyer about the possible consequences and remedies.

To his credit, Matt Smith does a solid job portraying the photographer, leaning into Mapplethorpe's lifestyle and never shying away from the shittier aspects of his personality. It's refreshing to see the silver screen spin on the life of a genius balanced with the truth about what a prick said genius could be. That said, Smith's performance doesn't do enough to make this movie worth the time.

I'm glad you're looking after your sister and I think you are right to at least want to check in on this further. Based on your post and a couple of comments from others, I do want to say that it is very important to focus on overall well being and not downplay this because of the common (but horribly misguided) perception that eating disorders only happen in people of a certain weight, that things like eating vegetables or running are inherently healthy no matter what quantity they are happening in, or that because she's at least eating something, that's not quite an eating disorder..

EDIT2: You can go to the State Board of Election Voter LookUp tool and (eventually, once it settled), find your sample ballot with all the elections you able to vote on in November. From there, you know which candidates you need to research to make the most informed decision. Again, I like primary sources. Candidate websites are about as primary as it gets (but definitely biased). I like Longleaf Politics, which provides fairly moderate analysis with a slight lean to the right. As I mentioned in a previous comment, the N will likely publish candidate coverage and questionnaires closer to the election.

This would actually be really cool because one of the main problems with Main stream starcraft is that they don bring enough knowledge to the commentating. While they addressing this with bringing in Gm casters (Tod, QxC, Nathanias etc.), It making it a lot harder for newer players to understand or follow what happening. In contrast, having a noob stream where they explain really basic stuff while the game is happening would be awesome. 
I just can determine if it is a good or bad sign. Perhaps neither. Maybe a hello or an acknowledgement. How should I go about returning the possible favor? I liked the original commenters idea of placing toast but I not sure

Also in Victoria, gambling and poker machine data is free and easily accessible to the public, however, in NSW this data is not freely accessible. It was recently reported that just 10 pubs in NSW made $117m profit in one year. That is profit, not turnover.

It might indicate that the hospital reacted rashly to attempt to look like they were "doing something". This is very common in high profile cases, not just in medicine but in all industries. 
The lifelong Angelena grew up in Compton and remembers being "definitely affected by incarceration in my neighborhood, and the lopsidedness of the criminal justice system." As her research progressed, though, she expanded her scope: "I thought it was just going to be about the prison industrial complex and prison for profit, but I started to see that in order to fully explain it, I had to give it historical, cultural context."
I glanced over, as if I could see through the door, and see who was there. When nothing moved or shifted, I chalked it up just hearing things. At first, that had happened a lot. I turned back to the pot, shifting my stew around with a wooden spoon. Then, there it was again, louder and more urgent. I was hearing things again, but as much as I wanted to just let that be it, I couldn't. A small hope inside of me, burned on strong.
DeepStack has an algorithm similar to Libratus nested subgame solving, which they call continual re solving. As in Libratus, the opponent exact bet size is added to the new abstraction of the remaining subgame to be solved. We published our paper on the web in October 2016 (and in a AAAI 17 workshop in February 2017), and the DeepStack team published theirs on arXiv in January 2017 (and in Science in late Spring 2017).

Facing turn jam, v is super polarized so having kh is really bad for bluff catching purposes, esp bc it a 3 bet pot where he flatted oop 3 way so he has mostly pairs and some suited Broadway hands pre flop. So kh is bad bc we block a lot of his potential flush draw bluffs. You have a lot of over pairs here, so you probably need a mixed strategy of some calls and some folds, which you can just do by folding when you have a heart and calling when you don.

The vast majority of the means of production are not the products of the capitalists labor. They were made by other workers. I suppose some capitalists may have built some of their machines themselves, but this is so minuscule out of the total set of machines and factories that it doesn justify their ownership of the rest. The early capitalists purchased machines and had factories built using wealth they had acquired from land ownership. Using these machines, and exploiting the landless proletariat, they were able to acquire more wealth to buy more machines.
Nights out I like to go out with the boys, having fun; I a bit of a lad. My son Chris, who is 22, has just reached the age where he happy to hang around with his dad, so I go out with him quite a lot. The other night he had six girls with him, all of them 19.

If you have the money to waste, go for it. The point of layering it is this: the ramp will skate faster when you are riding with the grain and slower when you are riding across the grain. Diagonal layering may provide the best compromise, but it tends to be a big pain in the ass and a waste of plywood. I suggest putting the surface on so that the grain runs lengthwise on the ramp. You cover more ground going back and forth than you do along the coping, so this should make it nice and fast.

Eh, you're underestimating the power some women have had in the past. England's Middle Ages saw a lot of equality in the lower classes with women owning their own businesses and property. They had access to the same education lower class men did. (It wasn't much, but hey.) True birth control wasn't too good but abortions were legal until around month 5 when the baby moved and midwives did them. It could be dangerous but that's the fault of biology, not society. Technology simply didn't exist for it. These rights started draining away around the same time as the Renaissance. Viking women had a great deal of power too.
All cases were decided in a single hearing and nobody complained of injustice. Contrary to today large benches, a single Qazi dispensed justice.

Every single dollar a CEO earns would not exist without someone doing the job on the ground level. The CEO and board are not essential. Management do more harm than good because they're there to keep labor working hard for the sake of profit. 
One of the best ways to do this is to practice on your own time, dealing yourself cards and figuring out what type of a poker hand they will make for you. And once this is done, you will then be able to play a passable game of poker. The factor that will make you a better than passable poker player however, will be experience.

Essential oils are used to stimulate a person's senses during treatment of illnesses or imbalances in the body. And aromatherapy is a health practice or an alternative medicine that is designed to cure a person from sickness using essential oils. Aromatic plants are gathered to extract very concentrated oils to be used during aromatherapy sessions. Even sinus infection can be cured by aromatherapy. All you need to do is to make a sinus oil blend, and use it. Here's how to cure your sinus problem using aromatherapy.

In his online chat, Warrecker tells the decoy,
I absolutely run into people who insist that they are submissive when they are, in fact, just lazy. They haven been my partners, fortunately. A good way to tell is if the person has done any research or attempted to learn anything about being submissive. If they know they have hard limits, soft limits, and a safeword, chances are they are a "true" submissive. (Also, if they worry about coming off as lazy.) If they tell you they don have any limits, chances are they never tried to learn a damn thing, and they can fuck right off.

McDonald was at fault because they were serving their coffee at 210 degrees instead of 180 degrees because it meant their coffee stayed hot and fresh longer, which allowed them to save money by making less batches of coffee per day.

I was a cobol programmer in the late 90s working for a software company that developed financial software for local government. It comes to no surprise to me that these applications would still be in use (after our Y2K fixes :)) as they just worked. After the initial development/testing/go live we'd have a few months of random bugs but after that it was just people entering bad data. Very stable, reliable, and easy to use once you got used to not having a mouse. Plus it was easy to code. I created the California PERS portion in about a week.

And I don agree that she more of POC than Caelynn. Caucasian Iranians might be "othered" because of Islamophobia, and that real bigotry, but being othered doesn mean having the experience of a POC. A Muslim Caucasian Iranian person can hide their religious affiliations and change their name to avoid being "othered" in the US in a way that women like Rachel and Kirpa cannot. That the difference between Islamophobia and racism. Race isn something you can hide or take off 99.9% of the time. Religion is at least more of a choice than race is. A child of a white Muslim parent can be given a name like Joelle Fletcher and raised non Muslim, and that child will likely avoid 99% of bigotry and discrimination. A child of a black or Asian parent can do that. Now, Muslims shouldn have to hide their religious affiliations or their ethnic origins at all, but being Muslim is not the same thing as being a POC. There is still racism in the Muslim community, where white or light skinned Muslims are privileged over Muslim POC. That why "Muslim" or "Iranian" cannot be a racial marker.

Now, those laws may not be very incorrect, in the sense that within the equivalence relation given by existential parametricity there may always be a representative that satisfies your/Van Laarhoven two laws, especially given a rich enough type theory. I find that to be very believable, though I have no proof (your work seems to make it over half way there I think). However, I still think those two laws are wrong by virtue of the fact that there exist values of "isomorphism lens type" that.

Been there. I went to another province for a few weeks to visit my parents. I wrote him a list of important stuff to remember to do (garbage day, recycling, a minor repair) while I was gone. Came home 2 3 weeks later to find 2 3 weeks of garbage and recycling, every dish in the kitchen dirty and the floor gritty underfoot. Also, he thrown out a fabric shower curtain that had grown a bit of mildew on one corner instead of, you know, washing it. The list was right where I placed it before leaving, on the coffee table. Covered in dust. His excuse was a combination of "I didn see the list/I forgot". But his SW Battlefront score was killer :/

The rest   well, it's a lavishly produced slog, and it may fool the Motion Picture Academy's craft branches and audiences taken with posh surfaces, but it won't fool anyone hoping for what the novel achieves: a portrait of a society with a doomed woman pinned to its center. Knightley is able to capture many aspects of Anna   her kindness, her superficiality, her perceptiveness   but the tragic dimension eludes her. Maybe she's not yet there as an actress; maybe Wright's smothering visual brilliance won't let her get there.
