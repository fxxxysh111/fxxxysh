TIL one of the original members of Fleetwood Mac went out to the store while on tour in California in 1971. He never returned and, after the band, record producers, and the police searched for him for several days, it was discovered that he had joined a cult called The Children of God. In reality, many people who claim to be Republicans do so just because they disagree with an idea, and they aren even fully aware of the entire message, point or platform against which they disagree. It simply put, not the Republican party, but the imbeciles who claim to be Republicans, that are making the Republican party a joke and a cult

When in doubt, see the fine folks over at for advice. I have to say that this is one of the best blog postings I have ever read! When all else fails you can do like my sister does. When we moved here, my sister went down hill, in a big way. Mom didn't care what she was doing and we did not know. By refusing to acknowledge your feelings and thoughts, the gaslighter causes you to doubt yourself more and more. It's like what in the world are you talking about!

To be honest, most the books I read are centered on geopolitics and environmental policy as its the sector I looking to integrate, so most "pure" environmental literature I tend to go through are papers.

Don't worry! You're not being mean at all! In hindsight, letting them see where I lived was definitely sketchy and not a good idea, but at the time, all that was in my brain was a "flee to safety" sort of response. I was scared to go outside at night alone for a while after. Thankfully this was two years ago and nothing happened after that and on the upside the apartment building was pretty huge and had a fair amount of security. I've since moved, but you're right to point that out   it's definitely something important to keep in mind in situations like this.

Similar type of professor so my plan was to show up an hour early. Just my luck I got pulled over for a random smog check. (I didn know that was a thing either.)

In Kas (which means "eyebrow" in Turkish) we stayed at a really nice hotel that set us each back $4 per night. Incredible! Immediately we met really nice people and had fun partying with them. One guy, Meki, who had a restaurant, and his Dutch friend Edmund decided to go with us on a day trip to a town called Kalkan. Of course Meki had a friend who had a restaurant there and his cousin had a disco there, so we were hooked up in that town! We went to a restaurant in the mountains where you picked out your own trout from a stream, they caught it and grilled it for you. Super delicious! We were out with them until 5 in the morning and then we slept for a few hours and then left town   onto the next adventure!

Sure variance matters since I want to know how likely I am to loose my entire roll, but it obvious on its face that it easier to go bust in a game with uncapped betting than one with a cap. CV is what players are really talking about when they talk about swinginess (how likely is it that I go on a sustained downswing where I continue to lose despite my edge?). You can really play loose aggressive in limit holdem, so everyone plays tight, but a tight player has more variance in limit holdem than no limit imo. A limit player is going to get forced into a lot of large pots due to drawing hands with barely enough pot odds to call and lose most of them, while a no limit player can play hands with high equity preflop and flop to reduce variance.

ConclusionThe Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde remains a classic novella that entertains generation after generation. Yet each film adaption of this timeless tale tells us something of the period in which it was made. The 1930s film changes politician Sir Danvers Carew, MP to become a soldier, Brigadier General Carew, ahead of the military build up to the Second World War. The 1940s present an austere, censored version that is respectable on the surface but nevertheless contains subversive dream sequences showing that American society is not quite as black and white as it first appears, with Hyde's subconscious whipping of Bea and Ivy foretelling the McCarthy witch hunt. It is notable that the women are named after nature, Bee and Ivy, at the time mankind's greatest atrocity against nature, the atomic bomb, was created. The 1960 adaptation has a licentious London full of enticing exciting nightclubs promoting pleasures and sexual promiscuity ahead of the swinging '60s sexual revolution. The early 1970s adaptation highlights gender relations and the changing role of women in society.

Sure old Christian ladies are certainly not helping but its not like the surplus of older women is outweighing the liberal, gay loving 20 somethings. In the west, straight young girls stan drag queens and talk shit about Becky with their gay best friends but this concept does not translate at all into Korea. Oftentimes young girls are equally as unreceptive to gays as their straight male counterparts. Furthermore, gay establishments in Korea charge women outrageous cover charges (popular itaewon gay club King charges men 15,000 cover and women 50,000) or completely prohibit them from entering. Straight Korean girls are not looking for gay best friends and gays are equally as uninterested in associating with the opposite sex.

Trustworthiness of a real game flow somehow affects the gaming community as well. The feeling is different when you're able to see the croupier actually at the table doing all the things he/she needs to do compared to witnessing the actions made by a piece of software you can't communicate to in any way or even consider an entity. Online casinos with live dealer games are attractive to players because they represent a certain level of fairness and safety. Despite the fact that digital games are regularly submitted to testing and verification by independent auditors such as eCOGRA, people believe what they see and it's that simple.
Other researchers have reported time to recovery in the most minor cases at 8 weeks; time to stabilization in the more severe cases at 17 weeks; and time to plateau in the most severe categories as 20.5 weeks. Thus, the notion that whiplash injuries heal in 6 12 weeks is challenged.

Fascia messy stuff. It hard to study. It so expansive and intertwined it resists the medical standard of being cut up and named for textbook illustrations.Besides that, its function is tricky, more subtle than that of the other systems.For the majority of medical history it been assumed that bones were our frame, muscles the motor, and fascia just packaging.In fact, the convention in med school dissections has been to remove as much of the fascia as possible in order to see what was underneath, the important stuff.That framed Illustration hanging in your doctor office of the red muscled, wide eyed human body is a body with its fascia cut away; it not what you look like inside, but it a lot neater and easier to study and it the way doctors have long been taught to look at you.

Etc?The simple field tests I mentioned, and thermal imaging are probably best   thermal imaging has the potential to expose a problem (or more accurately an area of injury) which hasn been considered or which was erroneously ruled out. X rays for those problems would require recumbency (putting her totally under and laying her down), but the catch 22 is those injuries are also likely to be seriously aggravated as she wakes up and tries to get her footing (I personally had a horse break his leg waking up after colic surgery, requiring his euthanasia   and he was even in a recovery room purpose built to prevent injuries as they come out of anesthesia), so tbh I wouldn recommend radiographs unless your vet it super confident it can be done safely.Honestly, aside from thermography your best bet for deciding neurologic vs mechanical injury might be a course of strong anti inflammatories and Robaxin (or similar muscle relaxer) for a week, followed by a dose of analgesic (one which provides good relief of pain without significant motor impairment) and concurrent lameness exam. If she shows significant improvement in the areas of short striding, holding her head to the right, holding her tail to the left, and/or willingness to bear weight on the leg, then very likely you have a pain issue.

In other words, burlesque is exactly what the soldiers and soldiers wives need: a source of bawdy humor that is also a social critique, a slap in the face, to the powers that control their lives. Like working class men and women a century ago, today enlisted soldiers are being screwed by a system that sends working class Americans to war after war after war, while the ruling classes (myself included) would never consider risking our lives for a system from which we benefit the most..

Last time I was on a greyhound some loudmouth drunk/high guy got on in Albany. He was annoying as all hell, so I put on some noise cancelling headphones and tried to ignore it. After a while I noticed that people were moving toward the front of the bus and it was suddenly very quiet. I looked back and saw the dude had projectile vomited all over the place and was sitting hunched over with his head by his knees. The bus driver called the police and the dude got arrested for public intoxication and I think possession. Then we had to wait around for a new bus. The new bus broke down in Connecticut.

The higher pitch of a womans voice trips our brains to things like having tingling sensations, release of hormones synonymous with arousal and so on which in turn actually contributes to being a worse active or passive listener; the effect goes as far as a man or woman brain being able to approximate fertility and adjust accordingly.

As far as the mom splaining stuff goes, just keep saying that you, your OB and when he time comes your pediatrician have decided that this is the best way to do things. "Mom, best practices have changed since you were raising babies. This is all backed up with the latest research, and my doctors and I agree that this is best for me and the baby."

I don't think this game needs ranked. Fortnite for example doesn't have any ranked mode and it does great. BRs are pretty random by their nature and if I was playing in a lobby with people of the same skill level, the early game would come down to loot luck which sucks. What I would like to see instead is a solo game mode, so that I don't keep losing because my random teammates are trash. Solo means it's all up to your skill alone which I think will be great for this game

Dogs like Labrador and Chesapeake Bay retrievers were bred as gundogs to hunt duck. Their job was to go get the bird after it was shot, and being a duck it would most likely be shot over water. They also have deep, barrel chests to help them float and thick rudder like tails. But even without special features bred into them most dogs are good swimmers. The exceptions are ones we over bred away from that, mostly the ones with short legs and squashed faces. English and French Bulldogs and Pugs are terrible swimmers without a life vest, and also sight hounds like Whippets and Greyhounds have so little body fat they sink without one. But still; give them a vest and most will instinctively know to paddle their feet in water. Whether they enjoy it or not is down to personal preference.

Self imposed advertising restrictions are expected to cost Sky tens of millions of pounds in annual revenue. Gambling accounts for about 200m per year in television advertising sales, and Sky is thought to control nearly half of the market.

It's not an easy thing to do the consumer research. 
Interestingly, humidity is a bit easier (and more accurate) than one might think. The consumer level stuff (a polymer that changes length based on uptake of moisture) is pretty sloppy, but sling psychrometry (or using the equivalent dry/wet bulb thermometer combination where the sling is replaced with a fan blowing air across the wet bulb) in conjunction with tables is much more accurate than dial type hygrometers..

Poker calculators are handy tools for online play that give you (at the very least) accurate pot odds to know if you should be in a hand in the first place, but also to offer the right advice for checking, folding, or betting in any given situation. Now consider this   the right advice from a poker calculator is actually the mathematically correct decision. As all experienced poker players will tell you, that is just part of the equation. There is absolutely no guarantee that a persistent maniac doesn't have your two pair DEAD TO RIGHT with a made straight. That's the intellectual part of the game. But poker is a game that persistently challenges not only your intellect, but your emotions as well. What may be surprising to you is that a poker calculator can help you check your emotions.

The owners of many tracks   along with ghost tracks that now offer only simulcast racing   are hoping to survive long enough for states to let them drop the facade of dog racing altogether and just run casinos.Lawmakers, mindful of the interests of deep pocketed casino operators who don't want the unfettered competition, seem to have other ideas.Last year, West Virginia lawmakers rejected a bill pushed by one of the state's two dog tracks to cut its licensing fees by more than half and to reduce the minimum number of race days.Two months ago, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad signed a bill that will shutter one of the state's two tracks by 2016.Florida, which in 1931 was the first state to legalize wagering on greyhound racing, opted against a measure in its most recent legislative session that would have allowed tracks to keep poker and slots and ditch the racing. The plan, which proponents hope to revive in the session next year, is seen as an expansion of gambling and faces opposition from gambling opponents and other competitors.The "decoupling" movement has created an odd alliance between racetrack casino operators, who see the races as a burden, and animal rights groups out to end greyhound racing altogether, much as they succeeded in outlawing cockfighting several years ago.

There is another storm cloud on the horizon. So far, downtown Manhattan has held up remarkably compared to Midtown, with vacancy rates at 8 percent. But the bloodbath in the financial sector and the industry's contraction will surely affect the area's real estate picture. The World Financial Center houses Merrill Lynch, but with the firm's takeover by Bank of America, Merrill's continued presence in the building is questionable. One million square feet is already available at 85 Broad Street, the current headquarters of Goldman Sachs, as the firm is set to move into new headquarters on West Street early next year. And firms that survived, like AIG, are hobbled and hardly in expansion mode. When you factor in developer Larry Silverstein's on again/off again World Trade Center project, it could increase available space in the neighborhood by several million square feet. "Jobs create the need for space," says Mack. "There's a big question as to what will take the financial industry's place, if it doesn't come back."

For the outside of the case, Llewellyn can source any type of wood (but predominantly uses Macassar ebony, masa birch, burr walnut and rosewood), and can add further personalisation through motifs, initials or engraved text.

I think that Queenie is under the imperious curse when she is with Grindewald. We see her basically fighting it as she goes through the flames and it makes SO much sense  it gives Grindewald a perfect edge in his manipulation tactics for anyone, but especially for Credence AND it's a perfect cheeky nod to her first scene when she has Jacob charmed to do her bidding, the poetic justice is just the type of thing Rowling would sneak in right in front of our eyes. It also would explain how quickly Queenie turns, a lot of comments on how it was poor plot development/cinematography but I'm telling ya it's gotta be the imperious curse.

But walking improves your overall health in an even more important way: If you do it briskly (at a rate of between three and five miles per hour) and continuously for at least 20 to 30 minutes, it becomes an aerobic exercise. An exercise is aerobic if you can do it rhythmically and continuously and at a brisk enough pace to force your heart and lungs to work harder to supply your major muscles with oxygen. By forcing your cardiovascular system to pump blood and oxygen continuously throughout your body, aerobic exercise stimulates and strengthens the heart, lungs, and muscles.

But when you playing yourself in specific situations   say especially heads up at a final table where you only play a small number of hands for a lot of money   are you typically thinking this way about keeping your ranges really balanced and hard to exploit? Or are you a lot more active in trying to play exploitatively against the tendencies of your opponents, and using a lot of very unbalanced ranges?Good question, I get asked this one a decent amount.
Problem with Venezuela is it suffered a rise in populism under Chvez. He came in and began eroding democratic norms including frequent attacks on the media undermining them, creating a polarized society, he used twitter and social media to push false narratives.

Well, unless the people who grow meat animals want comics or cheese whiz (they don you are SOL. But wait, Your neighbor wants the comics for his 3 year old. Awesome, you are in business. except they don have anything that the ranchers want either. So you are screwed. Well, enter gold. You trade the comics for gold (or silver more likely) and, as the rancher is smarter than you, you trade 10 oz of silver for a runt pig.

I consider myself a Motown enthusiast, but the label was more about big (or minor, they not that picky) chart toppers than cohesive albums   at least pre Marvin Gaye/Stevie Wonder magic. This album gimmick is to collect a bunch of the aforementioned chart toppers, performed by Motown most precious act, nay sensation of the time. So, these songs are immediately familiar, but selecting the right artists to record these songs (instead of just mindlessly handing them all to that one super successful vocal group) to turn them into the cultural tour de force they were really was Motown big achievement. The auxiliary renditions on "A Go Go" are merely pleasant diversion for both the Supremes and the listener.

Ben Affleck may be suiting up soon to play iconic superhero Batman, but here he explores his villainous side as gambling kingpin Ivan Block. When one of Block's poker websites swindles Princeton grad student Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) out of tuition money, the bright but broke kid travels to Costa Rica to confront the international entrepreneur. Block is impressed by Richie's savvy, offers him a job, and promises him limitless cash, ladies, and luxury. But, when FBI Agent Shavers (Anthony Mackie) tries to bring Block and associates to justice, Richie has to find a way to outwit them all or end up in a Costa Rican prison, ay.

Director Brad Furman comes to the table with no previous experience on a gambling movie, but he did helm the Matthew McConaughey legal thriller The Lincoln Lawyer. And that's a decent card to play.

Eye contact is key because they will note that you can identify them later or at that moment on the phone, which makes you a harder target..
