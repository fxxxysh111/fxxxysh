In Canada, public healthcare is good and all until you have to wait for the doctor in the clinic. Typically I expect to wait around 40 mins to go into a examination room and even another 20 mins in the room. If I have to get ultrasound, gotta wait another 20 mins to book an appointment. In emergency room, I seen waits that go up to 2 hours in a room full of sick people. While the "free" health care is good and all, the copious amount of wait time deters my doctor visits to at most once per year.

I majored in economics in undergrad. I think most people would get much more happiness and utility out of saving $300 or so on their glasses and spending it on something else. Then again, both my wife and I think spending hundreds of dollars on Gucci purses and pretty much everything else is horrific waste of money and would rather spend $20 on that stuff on trips or cruises or other life experiences; Veblen and conspicuous consumption and such. If you happen to get a lot of happiness out of designer glasses, then maybe that a good choice for you. Plus, I see a lot of very poor children and adults as patients, so my goal is to get them seeing clearly as cheaply as possible so they can do well in school or their jobs. Vanity is a far second, and even though I want them to be happy with their glasses, those patients need every dollar they have for other things in life. If you routinely see rich patients for whom a purchase of severy hundred dollars isn even a consideration, then yeah, get all the money out of them you can. In my experience, though, even working in Beverly Hills, Brentwood, etc, those people are fairly few and far between.

He was a family friend, he was Penny friend based off the fact that he totally knew exactly how she want to get back at Diego regarding prom and such. 
The image you project in the table is also very important. Build a sturdy table image by not bluffing early in your play. Bluffing too early in the game can make other players discern your bluff 100% of the time. Play good cards and throw away the unplayable ones. Have the opposite players at the table see you are only playing sturdy hands. This sets up the chance for you to use a smart bluff later in the sport as you have conditioned the others into thinking that after you raise, you have the cards that can win a hand.

FYI the term "net neutrality" started as boiler plate contract language between two ISP or whatever autonomous Internet system (AS). There was a "net neutrality" clause in the contracts, that is where this all started. and it like many other words that have taken on more baggage and meaning over time significantly different than how started. So we are talking about contracts laws here, but it become a big consumer protection blanket term for any and almost every issue across the board. an ISP throttling a customer is substantially different than the peering and transit services they provide to internet back haul providers. So I like how you listed common carrier, but that is one of the topics not related to net neutrality (as a contract language goes).

The ratio of caseins and whey in cow's milk is nowhere near sufficient to support a growing kitten [source: Fries]. If you're attempting to nurse kittens without the help of mom, pick up special cat's milk at the pet store. This "milk" is specially formulated to provide the right ratio of caseins and whey to meet the nutritional needs of kittens without the painful digestive issues associated with cow's milk.

But alas, there seems no God willing to punish Christians for using combat sports to reinvigorate an insecure and white masculinity.

Growing economic insecurity, the increase in women educational levels and salary potential, and, lets face it, the fact that American culture just doesn consider straight white Christian guys very sexy, many of them are drawn into the promise of the Promise Keepers (or the new Dockers ads for that matter).

The senator is not much pleased with getting beaten by the young gun and decides to have his henchmen beat Johnny and deform his 'lucky hand'.There aren't a lot of points of interest that came from this storyline, but two are the cameos. Doc from Back to the Future (Christopher Lloyd) makes a cameo as a back street doctor and Lady Gaga appears as a kindhearted waitress.Levitt's performance is solid, but why his character and storyline are even included is baffling. His story doesn't bring much action and in the end fizzles out with Levitt losing out to the powerful senator.Clive Owen's character Dwight is played this time around by Josh Brolin.

A little known fact is they actually planned to use nuclear devices in Vietnam. My old boss was one of the guys who was trained to do this. They had these small tactical nukes (about 80lbs or so) in a backpack and they planned to air drop the Army guys in, two to a team, and detonate them at the damns and flood the country in hopes for a quick surrender. I doubt it would accomplish much besides killing a lot of civilians.

When you are in a bathtub (with the door closed and while proned) during a bombing run, and you get 1 shot with a pistol, you look up at the killfeed and see it just scrolling with headshots as your whole squad dies to an attacker, you just have to watch the killcam. 
Some of these functions have local effects, while some are systemic (affecting the body's systems as a whole). For example, the stomach meridian consists of 45 points, stretching from the head to the toes. A point just below the knee known as Dubi, or Stomach 35, is used almost exclusively for knee pain (a local effect), while the point just three inches below it, known as Zusanli (Stomach 36), has a systemic function..

On the turn, what flush draws and gut shots are you really considering? I just don see QJcc out there trying to check and see a cheap river. More likely feels like a trap with KK or he so tilted he played a hand with a 9 like A9s or T9s. Just seems unlikely for $265 pre. I think I check behind now and reevaluate on the river. Not that it likely he improved on the turn, but checking twice makes me think I might be getting trapped.

So when the Cold War ended in the US, we Americans rewrote our foreign policy narratives to turn the bad guys, the Soviets, into good guys, the newly "democratic" Russians. Russians, meanwhile, continued to have very complicated feelings toward the US. ordinary Russians as well as policy makers, the US was powerful and therefore had to be taken into account. the US was also still seen as imperialistic (although primarily cultural imperialism after the Soviet Union), too simplistic, and far too arrogant.

I have gotten many commissions/contracts because someone saw my work posted on reddit or twitter (which I don even use) and they looked me up.I don even think it up for debate anymore that people are more likely to view a direct image link than to browse some website that might require a login (looking at you Pixiv). Anyone who really likes my work will probably search my portfolio anyway.Unless you are a major league artist like Sakimichan, who needs to control their IP for legal and financial purposes, you should just expect your artwork to be shared without your consent (which is why you always brand the artwork clearly).Unfortunately, the links or photos you posted could have been posted by anyone, and they don prove that you are the person doing the AMA. Your proof needs to be something that connects the fact that you doing an AMA with your identity. This could be something like a photo of you showing what you doing the AMA about with a sign that has your username and the date. It could also be documents (partially redacted if desired) with a note that has the username and the date.

In terms of proper poker strategy the sizing is donk as fuck. It way too big. Leaves behind a 1/4 or smaller bet OTT. Impossible to balance. Missing value when you have it, risking way too much when you don The best way to get money in the pot is bet the same amount relative to the size of the pot on each street. If he bets 75 into 180 and gets a caller he has 130 behind and there 330 in the pot, around 40pct each street. Betting 100 into 180 and picking up a caller = there 380 in the pot and he has 105 behind. Anyone who has a clue is gonna recognize that he have a tiny fraction of the pot behind when called and thus can never bluff turns, since he can be bluffing turns he can be bluffing flop either, as a flop bet would be sized such that if it doesn work there would be sufficient room to maneuver on the next street and decide whether or not to fire an additional barrel.

One of the more iconic images of the 1970s is a young, bikini clad girl sprawled on a plastic mesh lawn chair soaking up the hot summer sun. You can almost smell her tanning oil and hear the crackling of her transistor radio. For many people, there's nothing more relaxing than lolling about in the sunshine. However, like many things, the sun is best enjoyed in moderation. Its invisible UV B rays are necessary for enabling skin cells to produce vitamin D, but overexposure can cause sunburn, or worse.

My reiteration of said cue was meant to be reminiscent of a director or, I guess, a conductor (for the violin analogy below). As in: the actor has forgotten his entrance, give him his cue again.

The economic dislocation beginning in the 1980s and 1990s began the slow, inevitable process of not only wearing down our communities, but splintering them as well.

Whenever there's money involved, there are people willing to cheat. When poker was first played on Mississippi riverboats, it was often referred to simply as, "the cheating game." So it should come as no surprise that cheaters have gone to great lengths over the decades to give themselves an upper hand. Many cheating methods require a confederate, a partner at the table to help you put the plan into action. Usually, the dealer must be involved; considering the surveillance in place at modern casinos, finding a crooked dealer there is increasingly rare. However, at a less formal poker game, where the actual dealer rotates around the table, the two cheaters simply have to wait until one of them has the deal to put the plan into action.

If you're drawing a blank, then understanding the appeal of Zulfiqar Mirza's invective should not be too difficult. Stereotyping Sindhi political and social identity with ajraks, vaderas and dacoits in "interior Sindh" regularly goes unchallenged in Pakistan. Why should the stereotyping of Mohajirs with the MQM, and the stereotyping of the MQM with bhatta financing, with targeted killings and with urban violence at large be any different? The fact is that it isn't. Powerful stereotypes are not restricted to Larkana or Nawabshah. Far from the madness of Mirza's hate fuelled ethno political theatrics, the twinning of Mohajir identity with the MQM and the twinning of the MQM with violence is a distinct and palpable reality in living rooms right across Punjab.

There is a very long standing, deeply connected, and barely secret community around the participation in and facilitation of child abuse in the industry, and it extends publicly to the protection of the jobs and images of the abusers.

Of course, it extends past Hollywood to those in positions of great power.

Also, Mars freefall velocity due to air resistance is about 1/3rd that of Earth so factoring those two in, you can extend the model 3 charge up to 836.3 miles per charge accounting only for the gravitic difference and guesstimating the air resistance difference you could arguably say that a Model 3 could get around 1,000 miles (1609km) per charge with no payload attached, and if we assume a significant payload then we can half that and get 500 miles (804.5km) per charge with a model 3 acting like a mini semi on the surface of Mars all through the electric motor with ridiculous torque.

In fact, within the micro stakes rooms with betting limits of $.10 per bet or less, there is certainly occasionally no rake.

The 6 year old wants to earn $18,000 from the lawnmower race."All the money we bring in at the relay stays in our area," said Josh Rich, entertainment chairman for this year's relay and a 16 year veteran of the event. 
Professional players are interested in how much money they win, not the proportion of hands they win. Maximizing money can be done by many strategic routes including: playing lots of small pots; playing only a few big pots; losing only small pots but winning big pots; winning a few more big pots than you lose; and so on. Different strategies will produce different percentages of starting hands and different percentages of winning hands.

Even if you cooking your own food, say $10 $15 / meal (blue apron) on average, and let be honest here I can spend $15 at Chipotle, you talking several hundred a month on food. Gas / car insurance are probably your next 2 biggest expenses. 
If you want to see why, you have to look up their actual publications on a research platform like jstor or maybe even Google scholar, or one of their Press publications. I would recommend MIT Professor of history and native Turk Lerna Ekmekcioglu book called Recovering Armenia, and Cambridge historian Stefan Ihrig Justifying Genocide.

The poker table cloth that you use can be essential to the look and the feel of your game, and with just a little bit of time and effort, you are going to find yourself in a place where you can get the perfect look for your needs. When you are interested in playing a game of poker and you want a feel that is as professional as possible, the cloth that lines your table is going to be an important part of it, so see what you need to know about the kind of cloth that is going to be used!

The most valuable thing in there is the case. What I do in your position given your country refund policy is start by telling your mom how badly she got scammed. Then, I start by getting a new cpu, motherboard, and psu, and putting those in the new case. Personally given the new budget you on, I recommend the 2200G or the 2400G on a B450 motherboard, but that also requires ddr4 ram, so I don know if that in the budget yet. The integrated graphics on those will be better than the gt730 by miles. Save the actual GPU upgrade for last, and as you replace parts, try to see if you can get any money off them by either selling them to people who actually want them for some reason or by selling it to someone/some company for the raw metal. Personally I also recommend to try and involve your mother in the replacement process so that if she, for some reason, tries a stunt like this in the future, she at the least knows how to properly research and look for parts and how worth the price they are.

I was a poker and prodder too. But that was my life after my loss, incredibly worried when I didn't feel movement. I can tell you that even with poking and prodding (even at my 4am bathroom break), both my kiddos sleep just fine. They are both excellent nappers, my 2 yr old even takes 2 naps a day yet, and my sweet pea sleeps just about anywhere and any time. I did sleep with both my little ones next to my bed once they were here. My little guy for about 4 months and my peanut is still there. For DD (dear daughter) I got a brighter night light to have on next to her sleeper. That way if I wake up in the middle of the night I can peek in on her without turning on a brighter light. I think I was most stressed those first few weeks after bringing her home from the NICU. Once she started gaining weight and getting bigger, I felt more comfortable. Now, the only thing that is keeping her in our room is the fact that she would share the room with her 2 yr old brother and I'm afraid he'd crawl in the crib with her!!!!

So if villain announces call as hero is cutting his chips, hero can immediately pull back any chips that havent touched the table yet if he is bluffing, or if he has major value he can bet as many chips as he brought out. 
It one of those situations where I don think anyone at the company, or at least the forward facing personalities of the company, is homophobic or hateful outright, but there are definitely some people who still do and say stuff that pretty telling of how they actually feel and what they view is acceptable, all while balking at the idea of being homophobic when it called out. You can do homophobic/transphobic/racist/general shitty things without being an overt homophobe/transphone/racist/shit person in general. 
The event was a huge success with everyone enjoying the day and completing the hike!

Another place I love is Maurice Again, you can fit into both their regular and plus size lines so more selection for you! They have awesome jeans that are only $34 there.

I focus a lot of my time and energy into my career, because I love it so much. Outside of that, I have hobbies that I enjoy and I spend a lot of time with friends and family.

En ce qui concerne le judasme, on constate qu'il est plus enclin que le christianisme  l'emploi profane des matires parfumes. Ces dernires ne sont donc pas interdites   condition de proscrire les fins idoltres  (8). Quant  l'islam, on y retrouve une approche assez similaire  ce que firent des parfums les gyptiens de l'Antiquit :  que le parfum soit libralement utilis, ou rserv  l'change avec Dieu, il s'agit toujours de bannir ce qui fait horreur dans l'image du corps. Ainsi la bonne odeur et les aromates qui la favorisent sont ils signes de puret  (9). On retrouve donc, une fois de plus, l'ide de puret associe au parfum.

As I've said before, people love to run with myths, and sadly, this one is self sustaining: The misinformation brings a lot of vitriol, the vitriol prompts removals, and the removals result in more misinformation.

While at the same time, comments beginning with "I've heard." or "I've seen." get upvoted, read, and repeated by people who don't actually know anything about the situation..

It's kind of funny to think about it now, but back then we would hold our poker nights in different rooms. Some of us would bring adult beverages, others would bring chips or other snacks, and we would bring all the poker accessories. Whether it was cards, poker chips, or even a folding table that was mine and my roommate's job. The only problem was we carried the poker chips in a wicker basket my mom sent to school with a bunch of food in it.

Ah, so vegans only buy from local vegan farmers and don utilize crops produced from industrial agriculture, therefore keeping their hands clean of the primary reason animals are endangered/extinct. Gotcha, because otherwise I would just say they self righteously ignorant morons whose survival depends on the death of animals (who were never intended to die, like livestock) just as much as anyone else I making myself clear? Does any of that make sense?We always used tools to kill animals. A significant part of our rise to apex predator was due to our ability to create tools (after the discovery of fire and being able to cook meat giving us bigger brains).

One thing I never understood about the VA is that they don universally cover dental care for us. I wish I had the resources and time it would take to evaluate whether it would confer a cost saving for the VA(or insurance in general) to cover routine dental when so many things begin or are exacerbated from poor dentition and subsequent malnutrition. I can only imagine how much the VA spends yearly on things like Ensure Thic it that can become a lifelong expense..

They used to go out "canning" in the fall to raise money outside of stores and such, but Penn State put an end to that because of growing safety issues (culminating in a student getting killed in a car accident while returning from a canning trip). Now, students mostly raise money through crowdsourcing, events, and letters. There are even organizations specifically created to raise money for THON, and most clubs participate as well. Corporate sponsorship has also become a big part of fundraising through donations and other events. Here is a breakdown of fundraising for 2018.

The Tantra Massage is a technique developed by Andro Andreas Rothe, the founding father of the first German Tantra institute (Diamond Lotus Tantra Lounge, in Berlin since 1977). The male prostate massagers massage the lobes that surround the prostate gland resulting in its voluntary contraction. It's also seen, in lots of circumstances, that a mild massage of the prostate flushes out bacteria which might be trapped inside the prostate glands. The prostate gland could possibly be referred to as the male G spot and this prostate massager is accessible with a ribbed shaft and has a constructed in microchip. This microchip controls the three totally different vibration settings of the massager. The perineum stimulating stainless steel ball is the defining characteristic of this prostate massager.

But I could be wrong. Maybe its common to negotiate the bubble. In any case, best 200$ I have ever spent. I won some sick hands TBH. I also bluffed the big guys, which was the most satisfying. And I watch online poker, they tend to show their opponents that they were bluffing. Nobody in this group showed what they had, but every time my raise got other fold, I would just show my cards. I don know how bad that is, but I just wanted them to try and read me. Felt like it could be used in my favor. Sometimes I would have a really good hand and someone would fold, I would show my cards just to tell them "Nice fold".

This is an interesting addition to the collection (though not designated as a category) of several dozen cross section/tomographic/cutaway technical and medical illustration posts to this blog, though this one has a more complicated and perhaps more tragic history than most. It depicts work being done on the ill fated Hudson River tubes, which began life as a project in 1874 with construction starting in 1878; unfortunately there were at least three different companies that undertook the difficult project before going bust, and there was also one major disaster in 1883 in which more than 20 workers were killed. project got underway for the final time in 1899, and was opened to traffic in 1908. the top image workmen are installing a shielding that would later be abandoned, working I think via one electric spark lamp at upper left; below we see a casson in which a number of laborers were, that being sunk lower and lower as the excavations proceed. two images are about life size from when they appeared in Illustrirte Zeitung (Leipzig), on 29 January 1881 though they no doubt appeared a few months earlier in Harper Weekly or Scientific American or some such. .

It's a gruelling experience that rewards slow, methodical play and punishes carelessness or over confidence, but this admirable design is spoilt by poor key elements such as oddly flat and disorientating visuals. Your default weapon, a wrench, is idiotically underpowered and killing even weaker enemies is infuriating, while overpowered larger aliens prompt regular retreats. Running solves nothing, however, when success depends on harvesting junk from corpses and new areas to make ammo or health.

However just like gambling in a casino, online gambling also offers the risk of losing money too. The similarity of losing money if not gambling wisely can never be avoided, whether online or not. Here are 10 tips when gambling online. Even though gambling can be done online, it doesn mean you can escape the law of society. There are some places that make online gambling illegal. For a period of a year in the place where I live, the online gambling shops were closed due to laws. The problem is, it is hard to know which online casinos are legit and which ones provide great service.

There are lots of online casinos out there that make you play for free. Play for free at the various online casinos you visit. However, don be persuaded to play at the casino that you seem to be winning for free. It just might be a rouse to make you feel that their casino is a great place to win. Visit us to learn and play online poker and gambling games today.
At that point, I check back, and at least save myself from speculating whether or not it was a bluff. Most of the time, I have to call the turn with my check/call hand, so why not just waste my bet on the flop and at least get some information out of it?.

That's not to take anything away from Jessica Chastain, who inhabits the role of poker impresario Molly Bloom with such panache and vivaciousness that she may well take home a best actress Oscar. Whatever plaudits she receives, though, will be due to Sorkin's cunning screenplay."Molly's Game" is Sorkin's directorial debut, and captures the same staccato patter of Sorkin's trademark TV series "Sports Night," "The West Wing" and "The Newsroom," as well as the awards darling films he penned, "The Social Network," "Moneyball" and "Steve Jobs."Bloom narrates the bewildering tale after the fact, explaining how she was was a genius and elite athlete turned chronic underachiever in her early 20s.

Reiki can be used to treat imbalances on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels. When any one of these areas is out of balance, the other areas are also affected. Thus a physical affliction is believed to be a manifestation of an energetic imbalance rather than a symptom to be eradicated. Reiki works by removing blockages to the flow of life force both within the physical body and the energy fields that immediately surround it. When one's life force is in balance, a person can sustain wellness on all levels.
