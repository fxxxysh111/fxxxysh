This strategy can also be useful for estate planning if you wish to maximize the amount available to your heirs by lowering your tax bill on death. For example, for someone in a lower  or middle income tax bracket, it may make sense to strategically withdraw more than the mandatory minimum annual amount from your RRIF. These withdrawals might be taxed at lower rates while you alive, rather than have the entire fair market value of your RRIF (or RRSP, for that matter) taxed as income in the year of death (absent a tax deferred transfer to a surviving spouse or partner).

Be Careful, Protect Your Stack   You must protect your stack and survive until you get some good hands you can use, so be careful to expend that chip depot deliberately and judiciously   always with purpose. When a player raises you significantly, you must think: 1) how much of my stack can I afford to invest in this one hand, 2) can I win this hand if I play it fully, and 3) what kind of play will yield me the most chips and give me the best overall odds to win against this particular player.

Other good, late pokers include the 3ft, yellow 'Brimstone'. This willowy, classy poker begins in July, but invariably has a swansong in mid October. The yellow orange 'November Glory', making a superb show in the trial, will persist until November. This is from Bob Brown's Cotswold Garden Flowers (see suppliers), which has a large range. Bob also lists 'Frances Victoria', a slender flowered poker that opens green yellow in late October before flushing to apricot. It can apparently flower in December in mild years.
Using an earlier example in this article, assume you have a pair of aces, and you place a $100 bet and one player calls with AK. The way to determine your EV is as follows: Put yourself in this situation 100 times. (It costs you $10,000 [$100 times 100] to enter this situation 100 times.) You will win 92 times and receive your $100 in return plus your opponent's $100 for a total of $18,400. You will lose your $100 the other eight times. Therefore, your $10,000 investment nets you $8,400 in profit ($18,400 minus $10,000). Now divide the profit ($8,400) by 100 times, and this figure   $84   equals your EV. What this tells you is that, on average, you will win $84 every time you are in this same situation. Good poker players maximize the times they have positive EV and minimize the times they have negative EV.

Most people who live this way don and can work. Do not use any sort of carbon monoxide producing heater in your car, the risk is not worth it. If it comes to that take the risk of emergency shelter. If they are first come first serve just show up early. If you are working and car living you will need and be able to afford indoor motel/Airbnb respite sometimes. If I were you I would not be settling in to stay in the car, I would be working on getting physical shelter ASAP.

For example, people who are new at the game might want to play at a lower level like 1$/2$ (or 1 cent/2 cent if you playing online). The great thing about that is the people who play at the lower levels of the game are generally the less skilled players. It like you actually can a level and advance to the next where the competition is stronger but the money you can make is better, just like if it were a video game.

Overall, it continues to appear that this construction cycle was cut short by the financial crisis and never had a chance to fully mature. In the end, this will prove to be a boon, as supply growth will not be excessive as demand and rates improve. The hope now is that, when demand and prices more fully recover and financing becomes more readily available, construction will bounce back faster than in previous cycles.

This sentencing is an attack on the rule of law. This is Ellis saying that white collar crime is no big deal. Ellis expressed disdain for the prosecution throughout the entire trial.

I started hanging out with another girl whom i fucking adore and am connecting with really well. She had bad experiences with poly folks in the past and is only single at the moment. She also re examining her approach to sexuality and some troubling thoughts and behaviors. Says she going to be celibate for a while but she be willing to re consider that.

I just absolutely refuse to hurt her or for her to feel used (which is true of any potential partners.) so i am going reeaal slow, trying to show her i really care about her, that i really like her, while also making it obvious i find her painfully attractive.

Let say (HUSNG) you playing against a player who you notice folds all of the time in the big blind to a shove from the button. Maximum +EV would be to shove all of the time with all of your holdings. But this is not a GTO strategy, as it can be exploited. The player can adapt and stop folding 100% of the time. This is an important assumption to have as well. To make it clear, GTO gets misconstrued to mean a lot of things, it is just a long term unexploitable strategy. I feel I being as objective as possible here, Nash equilibrium has been a huge part of HUSNG for a while now.

He arrived with his gun men and shot her in the thighs and legs, so she couldn't dance anymore. At this point, I do not care about her dancing.

Or at least the sort of students any college should want to attract  the ones who know that it not about "perfect" but about knowledge  which can happen in crumbling buildings with no air conditioning and weeds all around. And knowledge which can happen without the help of vice presidents without end earning 5 times what the professors teaching them earn. In fact, I be willing to say that few students care about the administrators they encounter in their four years at college and if the cost of the administrators was offered to them as a choice, a sort of educational menu, most students would choose lower costs over "perfect.".

Intensive care unit (ICU) costs contribute significantly to hospital costs and stem from intervention services and management of sepsis including nosocomial infections. 
Another important point is, that Germany has a special relationship with Russia as it population (not the government) sacrificed arguably the most in WWII to free Europe from the nazis and also because they were supportive of the German reunification, which took an insane amount of diplomatic work.

If he told you not to be a stranger, he probably not sure if you upset and doesn want to hurt you more. 
But from my ethical stand point, the more I have equals the more I can share. 
I can't argue with that. It is the parents responsibility to provide and as long as we don't ask for results equaling the cost of providing (meaning best private school = Harvard) then I'm fine with that, that's where I draw the line. But I also think it's the parents responsibility to make education meaningful and enjoyable and not just providing them financially. 
Now, keep in mind, this is by far the biggest bet in $ amount that I have ever made at this point in my poker career (not to mention it a bluff!). So I sweating Villain hard. I know that if I get called, I always lose.

No, you do not. This betrays a very limited knowledge of the syntax of various SAE languages (which differ amongst each other significantly) and the syntax of both English and Mandarin. While in some cases there may be surface level similarities, and even in a few cases some deeper parallels, there no way someone who has actually studied Chinese syntax to any meaningful degree would make this claim.

I don think there will ever be a day where our team actively decides to move all esports off the subreddit or to move all esports onto the subreddit in favor of other league of legends content. We really don want to split the sub. That said, there are a lot of other league subreddits out there that do absorb the content we don allow: /r/lolesports, /r/summonerschool, /r/rule34lol, /r/leagueofmemes, then there all the team specific and champion specific subreddits.

The foundation has refused to explain how it calculated the 30 per centdistribution figure for 2014. But it may involve a related charity, known as The Shane Warne Necessitous Circumstances Fund, which reportedly distributed $83,400 to needy children that year. 
The payout for blackjack depends on many small variations of the rule. Some of these rules that should be given concern are: how many decks of cards are being used? Can a player double and split bets on few hands? Does the dealer peak for blackjack before the players? Can the player still surrender when the dealer has an ace for an up card?

The briefest background here shows that the most popularizing idea of life on Mars came about as a mistranslation/interpretation of astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli observing term "canali" to be "canals/channels", meaning an intelligent life form existed on the planet capable of constructing large technological forms.

North Korea has had nukes for over a decade, but the turning point was the missile tests spearheaded by Kim jong un. US territory was now in direct threat, and every missile test was a treasure trove of data to improve upon for NK. Stopping those tests was undeniably a priority  and it has stopped for over a year now. That is definitely not nothing. Ceasing war exercises is the price to pay for maintaining diplomacy. In your opinion, has that degraded readiness?
Complaint   Stupid elections in Spain means the marathon we were signed up for is postponed for a week. None of us can go that week :(. Can even go to Barcelona cause there will be rioting (that part of the country is trying to separate from Spain). Flight money lost about 200 each.
And to be honest this was also the reason I did not play any Total War before Warhammer, and also the reason that despite me wantint to try I am unable to enjoy other Total War games (I own Rome 2: Emperor Edition and tried Shogun 2 demo 3 times).I love the art style of 3K but I completely utterly indifferent towards it characters and without a liked or beloved character I can hold onto and guide thourgh his/her path in the campaign, I simply cannot care to be motivated to move a finger. 10 points  submitted 11 days agoWe dated for a while, and still hooked up occasionally after "breaking up." Although she was conventionally only just above average in looks the way she carried herself, talked, acted and just existed made me fall head over heels for her.After being together as a couple/"friends" for eight months she went overseas to finish her degree (she was taking a gap year after some messed up stuff happened to her) and although we talked less we were still affectionate (in a non sexual way) with each other.I met up with her over the summer and she made it quite clear from the start that she wanted to be friends, not "friends" with all the sexual intimacy that came with being "friends." She wanted to hook me up with a friend of hers and I ended up dating her friend for the past 8 or so months.I want to see her as just a friend but to be honest I still have quite a lot of feelings for her.So what am I doing? I not talking to her, at least not for now. In the future when my feelings have died down I hope that we can hang out sometime and just be friends but at the moment I feel that if I talk to her it won be helpful to myself or more importantly her or my girlfriend.With yourself OP maybe you could try dating other women? Maybe when you are seeing someone else your feelings for her will start to lessen.

EDIT: Instead of answering everyone individually, TL:DR We stayed in contact through high school, I went on an epic cross country Amtrak trip when I was 16 with them, we drifted apart for about 15 years before reconnecting on Facebook.

While I agree with you, I want to point out that a Bernie Sanders for President run is basically insurance that Trump will win re election. I too want to see the country go back towards the direction Obama was taking us and I had hoped Hillary would continue to take us on. However, the last thing we need is a nearly 80 year old white guy running on stolen ideas.

As a cosmetic surgeon from a Gulf state told me, he used to only see women for nose jobs because it was considered unIslamic to show a male doctor your body for reasons of vanity as opposed to illness. however, he sees more and more (fully veiled) women for boob jobs and lipo. is a trend he himself sees as fully Islamic since God is beautiful and therefore we must love beauty.
Definitely not worth it, at least for me.. 
The art of change is something to be very cautious about, because we need to preserve what has been done but we also need to move forward. Like now we play hockey in the parking lot during Shabbat, so we have our tradition but we are also doing something different. We just had our first Parsha and Poker, where we learn the Torah together and then we play cards.. 
A letter from my lawyer to my ex lawyer would cost me between $60 $100. Odds are pretty high that would be all it would take to stop this bullshit. I definitely pay that much to stop my ex from abusing my kid like this.

I think gray and grey both have uses, but I personally feel they should just notate different kinds of grays. Gray feels like it should describe warm tones of gray, like low saturated reds or yellows. Grey applies nicely to cool grays, with undertones of blue or purple. "Gray" is only one letter away from "Gravy", which is delicious when warm and often disgusting when cold. "Grey" has an E in it, like STEEL. Steel is COLD.

Keep track of at least 1,500 hours worth of play. This is where you're going to say, "Aww, man, that sounds like work." And it is   to make this your living, you gotta put in the grunt work. And that means keeping track of every game you play and the results.

Green felt is classic and if you have room that is paneled in dark wood or decorated with dark colors, you will find that it can be a great way to get the effect that you are after. On the other hand, if you find that green is a little bit boring, you will soon discover that there are many colors that might suit you.

The Henderson City Council will vote tonight on a four month ban to prevent new massage parlors from opening and give staff time to craft new rules to crack down on prostitution in the industry.The 120 day moratorium would stop the licensing of any new massage establishments until September.The target of the new rules would be massage parlors that engage in prostitution and human trafficking.City Attorney Josh Reid said the vast majority of the city's 83 massage establishments follow the law, but there are a few "bad apples" that need to be weeded out.The current enforcement strategy focuses on issuing misdemeanor citations to individual workers caught breaking the law, whether for prostitution or any other violation of regulations.

Studies were conducted in the United States and Asia. Participants were men and women aged between 30 and 88 years diagnosed with metastases relating to lung, breast, pancreas, prostate and colorectal cancers; some patients had bone metastases. All patients had an estimated life expectancy of less than six months. Most patients received full body or partial massage as part of palliative care in a hospice or oncological centre. Intervention durations varied (five to 45 minutes) and different outcome measures were employed.

Anyways, I struggled to understand why I want monogamy and I think you really helped me understand why. As of late, I'm a big fan of stoicism and I have struggled internally with aligning what I know to be true (humans weren't wired to be monogamous) and what I feel (I strongly value exclusivity probably because of my childhood issues.) I felt bad because almost every google search for monogamy will bring up a lot of articles about how monogamy is dumb. But looking at it as a choice, along with the other choices one can make for their relationship really puts things into perspective.

I see you on 52book which probably means you intend to read all of these, but I do genuinely think that trying to keep a low amount of unread books on your shelves is a great thing to teach yourself.

I don agree with "unfair" or "appropriately" btw. What is unfair is if you spring the ruling on them in the middle of combat, especially if it a completely unreasonable ruling. But, from this thread alone it appears that 5e treatment is out of line with both how we understand the world and all the previous editions. So it not really a radical question to ask or ruling to make. It personal preference whether you want to lean tight toward RAW or adjust the rules for more verisimilitude. The designers themselves don advocate for rigid adherence to RAW   or use RAW alone in their own games.

(MLive file photo)LANSING   A judge ordered the state to temporarily stop enforcing new charitable gaming rules that went into effect earlier this month. Michigan Court of Claims Judge Pat Donofrio on Friday issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Michigan Gaming Control Board from implementing or enforcing the new rules while a related lawsuit plays out in court. The rules took effect May 14 and restrict so called "millionaire parties" that allow nonprofit groups to raise funds by hosting casino style games such as Texas Hold 'em and blackjack. She said the injunction is a "breath of fresh air" that will allow the group and charity poker businesses to determine the next steps from a legal and business perspective. "Our hope is the governor's office finds this enough of an incentive to try to come back and meet with lawmakers and deal with Senate Bill 878 that addresses the problems that have been going on in the industry while still protecting charities ability to raise funds," she said. The state Senate in Aprilunanimously passed SB 878that would allow poker rooms and other locations to host games seven days a week as long as no more than four charities hold events at the same location at the same time. The House has conducted hearings on the bill but has not approved it. Rick Kalm, executive director of the gaming control board, said on Friday afternoon that he hadn't seen the order but that the board always respects the court's decision. He added that the board has approved 263 millionaire party licenses equating to 869 event days to occur between May 14 and the end of June. Kalm has previously said the new rules were meant to address issues of gaming violations, violence and other problems at some permanent poker rooms.

Experiment with finger placement. While the standard shuffle grip works for both right  and left handed people, it may not work best for everyone.[7] You can place your fingers however you like, as long as the position fulfills two major requirements: You must have at least one digit on the far outside edge of each stack so that they can be pushed together.

What about Cotto? Wouldn't a rematch at 154 lbs be somewhat appealing? Wouldn't Arum love to see if Pac Cotto II could outdraw Cotto Mayweather in PPV sales and gate receipts? Yes. And yes. But the problem here is that neither Cotto nor Pacquiao are currently donning title straps.

You definitely right in that Gregson was below her, socially. Honestly, I always thought it was refreshing that Edith didn seem to care about that.

The songs feel more diverse on the self titled, the production sounds more up front and full. Colour is much spacier, quieter.

Writing clean, concise notes by hand is one of the most powerful ways to absorb complex/technical information. It so powerful, that many of the best students you ever meet take notes quickly in lecture and then go back and re copy their notes carefully, taking time to reorganize the information logically, re state the really important topics, and maybe add a few examples or questions as they go. Obviously, going through this process with electronic notes is helpful too, and probably has a similar level of benefit if you type the notes out in class but hand write them later on.

In the past (emphasize on past, lately, not so much) China has made it clear it is willing to maintain the status quo as long as the ROC government claims that there is one China. Since by the constitution, the land China is part of ROC, and we agree there is one China (country), then (by their logic) Taiwan is also part of China. Thus our constitution still states we own the land China to maintain the status quo..

John Parmeter's lawyer, John Ellis, said it was difficult to secure prosecutions in historic child sex abuse cases, and ''things went pretty badly wrong'' with the Brock case.

Former Maitland Newcastle diocese child protection officer Helen Keevers said she vomited beside her car after hearing John Parmeter's allegations in September 2007.

For sure, let say the job hours are 9 to 5, that means he has to leave at 7:30 at least, more like 7:00 if we are being realistic, he has to leave home before the kids even go to school, he won be dropping any of the kids at school anymore. He will be getting home at 6:30 at the earliest, but let put it to 7:00 realistically. So he gets home to have dinner and kiss the kids goodnight, that it.

It's one of the most visited stately homes in the UK.2. It's old and steeped in history. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade I listed building, with a collection of armoury second only to that of the Tower of London.Over its long history, it has been owned by 36 different individuals, plus four periods as Crown property under seven different monarchs.It was the family seat of the Earls of Warwick, which included inheritance through the female line so the castle has had three woman or girl owners.Eleven of the monument's owners were under the age of 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three.

The best way to represent this unusual cadre of skills is to start Doc off with the Maverick archetype of the gunslinger. Mavericks lose out on Gunslinger's Dodge, Pistol Whip, and Gunslinger's Initiative, but instead they gain Stacked Deck (allowing them to gain bonuses on Bluff, Profession (Gambler), and Sleight of Hand checks), Fist Fighter (treated as having Improved Unarmed Strike as long as they have 1 grit point left), and Gun Twirl (gaining the Dazzling Display feat, and being able to use it with any firearms even without having Weapon Focus as long as he still has 1 grit point left)..
