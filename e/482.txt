Fnatic is extremely good on Inferno. Their last 3 games here were 16 14 against LG, 16 2 against G2 (old G2) and 16 7 against TQM. They have played here quite a few times so far this year and all of their results have been pretty good. The only thing that would worry me is their 14 16 loss against ex Titan (the team they up against here), but it may have just been an anomaly. Fnatic usually don lose to anyone on Inferno, let alone a team that isn in the top 5. I think that even with this past loss they should definitely be favored by a pretty large margin.

I was lucky enough to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium when they had a baby great white in their big tank. They had it there for a while (198 days, according to a Google search, which is about six and a half months) and got it to eat the food they gave it. It hung out nicely enough with the other critters but then had to be released when it attacked two other sharks it shared a tank with. The tank they kept it in is monstrous (one million gallons) and is home to tons of animals that all live together. If the great white had the place to itself it probably would have fared better, but that hundreds of critters that would need to be re homed, plus who knows if the GWS would have been happier for longer, or if she would have become just as depressed or aggressive, or what else could have happened.

I just recently started applying to go back to school to complete my degree, which was in the sciences. But the light designer at the community theatre I been follow spotting at for a few years now just blew my mind tonight with the simple comment of "yeah you could totally do this for a living." And now I dunno. I love love love to do theatre professionally, for the rest of my life. If I potentially don have to go into debt to do it, that sounds fantastic! :)

First of all if you have a kid and aren't prepared for them to turn out different than what you perceive as the "default", reconsider your life and your expectations of other people. Notwithstanding, how you raise your kid has nothing to do with what their sexuality turns out to be. If a boy plays with a doll it doesn't mean he's gay.

As of right now I am a pretty big winner in the 5 10 10 20 games but probably would have trouble moving up past this point. I am just trying to figure out if it is worth the amount of work I would have to put in if I only plan on playing for another couple years. I understand the difficulty of the next step I would have to make (I pretty good at using teh computers for teh maths), but it is still hard to calculate if my time would be better allocated grinding stats out for poker or for something else. I know that it is a decision that I have to come to on my own but it is just really weird being in such a middling zone.

Couple that with the demographic we talking about here, typically old and white (race presents it own complexities the Russians have been trying to exploit for over 80yrs because they deftly understand it our Achilles heel), and it makes sense they wouldn believe this could happen as they can grasp the current threat because they by and large don grasp the technology. During the Cold War it was easy to understand the threat Russia posed because nuclear weapons are very in your face about the massive scale of damage and destruction they wreak. In this new cyberwar era the Russian threat is a trojan horse (or maybe stacking dolls would be more apt) that comes into the palms of everyone hands.

Although it is far from being a "totally bad dictionary", it does have numerous inconsistencies like the one that led to this thread. I have also gotten plain wrong translations for basic words, or sometimes more popular translations won even exist for a specific term. This is because, instead of using the Collins or Oxford dictionaries, they use a service provided by Curiosity Media, which doesn seem to have a single language expert in its team. How can you trust a dictionary if it was made by non experts?

At first, many Germans thought it was just another concentration camp, or work camp. In fact, many Germans remained deluded due to their own stupidity, or zealotry, or because they simply could not grasp that what was happening really was happening. Certainly, many people DID understand what was going on. But by 1941, when the first actual extermination camps were built, it was far too late to protest and all they could do was watch in horror. People who did protest were killed themselves. There were groups like the White Rose who tried to resist but they were mostly murdered when the Nazis caught them.

He dropped me off, and refused to take any money, and just asked that I pass on a favour if I was able to. I still think about that, and how that situation could have gone so very very much worse. It was so totally selfless, and so opposite of anyone I knew at the time, it really made me reconsider my friend group, which was a good thing, and also made me desperately sad that I had nobody to call to help me when I really needed it..

Over the last five years with my teacher, particularly this last year, it become apparent to me, i think, that the real challenge of being a healer is healing ourselves; purifying ourselves and increasing the quality and magnitude of our own "vibration"; our own subtle energy that those around us, including our patients, can sense. I finding that i need to become this healer and, in order to do this, i need to heal myself. I need to face my own fears, my own addictions, my own apathy and ignorance, and cultivate the good: ethics, obedience, discipline, and other qualities i could probably go on about. For example, shiatsu is a hard no, as is energy work and yoga instruction. Those looking to offer traditional healing arts will find it difficult to do so without breaching SOP.

But there likely will be a few more quests. For example, The quests with the College of Whispers at Frostcrag Spire Tower was clearly unfinished. Quests connecting Bruma with the political turmoil of Cyrodiil will need to be implemented. Plus, I guessing that when the full release comes out, you end up receiving an actual quest when you talk to Bathes In Murky Waters. The town of Applewatch had a large building (or was it two?) that were un accessible. The devs informed us that they were part of a quest that would cross county lines so would be implemented in the full release.

Der Rundweg durchs Museum beginnt im 1. Stock. Ein recht ausfhrlicher Film zeigt alle 14 Arbeitsschritte, die ntig sind von der Gewinnung der Rohseide bis zum fertigen Werkstck. Der Film ist sehr informativ, streckenweise fanden wir ihn ein bisschen langatmig. Leider zeigt das Museum nur die Form der Seidengewinnung, bei der die Raupen in ihren Kokons durch Hitze gettet werden. Die alternative Form, bei der die Raupen sich zu Faltern entwickeln drfen und dann von allein den Kokon verlassen, wird nicht gezeigt. Diese Seide gilt als minderwertig.

Both of the weapons used by Lubke aircraft seem as though they would be devastating, and indiscriminate. (Politicians would pull away from the idea of attacking civilian areas and sign treaties to that effect that all went away with the invasion of China by Japan, and the attack upon cities by Nazi forces in WWII the Allies followed suit almost immediately thereafter.) Lubke image (which appears in the section titled "Der Zukunftskrieg und die Technik") must have seemed terrifying to his readers of 1927, though they are at least spared the image of the effects on the population in the imagery of the attack. Of course things rapidly in the few years following that, so that by the end of WWI people got a good taste of what it meant to controlling pieces of property without actually occupying them, raining chaos and destruction from above.

It isn as though color printing was new in the publishing industry, as books had been printed in different colors besides black for at least 300 years by this time; even full color printing had been around for 120+ years, so it isn as though they were experimenting with the color equivalent of newly available typefaces in a 1985 word program. Color photography in books is brand new at this point, the wide scale use taking place this year, but these images are not photos, so I doubt that this had much of an effect on the creativity of the designer. Was very adventurously used int he early sci fi pulps and monthlies, but that stuff was already being employed for two decades by this point so their newness in regard to publishing experimentation is not an issue.

I a Maori/Samoan living in Hong Kong at the moment and had a real interesting chat about the movie Mulan before Moana had come out. I told my HK Chinese colleagues that Mulan was one of my favourite Disney movies. I was surprised to hear from them that, while they liked the movie too, Mulan wasn Chinese. They considered the Disney Mulan to be what "Westerners" think Chinese is (in terms of appearance and culture). It was a super interesting thought, but not one I completely understood until Moana was released.

You have enough room to create a notch and many commercial brakes have 2 notches cut out for that reason, and also perhaps so you can adjust what direction you want the compensation to go. The AKM muzzle brake is intentionally offset to account for the imbalance of the bolt carrier, and with the AKS 74 being even lighter it might make sense to just run it in the current notch. Either way, if you cut a notch you be fine, it doesn take any load and you have enough clearance.
Galley does things a little differently than most of the Twin Cities' existing or on the way food halls, in that they're also a restaurant accelerator.

One of the key grounds on which environmental attorneys say the trial decision is vulnerable on appeal is failing to consider more environmentally sound alternatives than just adding more concrete to an already compromised site. In a world threatened by climate change, where green ideas have suddenly gained new currency, perhaps it's time to acknowledge that we can no longer just build our way out of problems.

Claim your walls and furniture. I am not sure this works for females as well as males, but for my male kitty, this worked amazingly well. Clean up his marking when he is watching using a spray bottle (Nature's Miracle). Clearly state this is "My wall!" Look at him when you say this. For my kitten, this sank in very well. I claimed all the wall space while he watched me and even sprayed the furniture. As cats usually find security with their people, I believe it does not stress your cat by you claiming your walls and furniture, but rather gives them a since of comfort because they are yours and not the other cats. I believe this works better in multi cat households where there might be some inter territorial issues.

I think preflop sizing is fine as well, but I do agree with JohnRusty that the post flop decisions here are not particularly significant to EV. It can be easy, especially in hindsight, to look at a high variance spot and think there was a crucial decision point that dictates a massive EV turning point. That can be certainly true in some cases, but I don think this is one. For an actual post game analysis given the information here, we somewhere between 22% (if V only has sets/2p/AA) and 50% (all TT+, JT, AJs, KQ, KJs, A3dd, AQdd). Maybe even higher if V has random bluffs with underpairs or the bizarro bluffs you sometimes see in live poker. In any case, without any info on them, it hard to place where we are in this equity range.

7. Mood related mistakes or 'going on tilt'   many players loose their temper in the following situations: after loosing a big pot, after someone got a 'miracle' card and beat them, after they were bluffed, when they loose a lot of money or for some other reasons. If you are 'on tilt' and can't control your feelings   leave the table immediately. You can't win poker when you are not concentrated on the game. If you recognize others in this situation, exploit it. They tend to play a lot of hands and go too far with those hands. Let them take your blinds when you have bad or even mediocre hands, and play aggressively with your good hands.

I believe that in some parts of the US you can live on much less for the same lifestyle, but not in the major cities. And I know rural Indiana is a fine place to live, but a civilization historically requires things like universities, business hubs, large corporation headquarters, arts culture, etc. If we all moved away from cities to rural property we quickly lose the ability to make major positive innovations to our society. I see so much "I live in rural Indiana and I do just fine" in this thread, but what they really saying is "I live in rural Indiana and I fine as long as millions of other people keep living in big cities living paycheck to paycheck so I have access to the Internet, hospitals, medical breakthroughs, and a functioning government. Good luck living in a rural area with no large cities or government hubs to run your nation and your civilization for you.

Proper hydration allows the body to process the waste easier and excrete the out through urine or sweat.

Live PLO is very soft. Its always 9 handed, which in my opinion is a terrible format for PLO, and there are many players who like to limp every hand. It also seems to play more "honest" and very rarely will you see people run big bluffs. They also use pot sizing more often than online. The live stakes are also definitely larger than the blinds would indicate. Aria 1/2 PLO is a $5 bring in with a $500 cap buy in. Open raise is to 15. I been in that game for as much as 4.5k. They also run a rock game 2/5/10 which can become an absolutely massive game. Many regs have had 10k 15k +/  swings in a session that game. Also a relatively soft game given the stakes.

You'll learn that not every hand that has a card with a letter on it is a powerhouse worth playing.

Depends on what cattlebeast we are talking here, and whether it is horned or not. A bull tends to be more ferocious than a cow would, and double that when he's got horns. However, a cow can be just as dangerous if she has a calf that she needs to protect with her life. And it really doesn't matter what type or size they are!
