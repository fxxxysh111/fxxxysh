I would argue that it was backwards. The royal family were lunatics by the time the japanese annexed the country. Most of the people were living as they did 5 centuries before. Japan had been in an industrial revolution since the meiji period and the destruction of the shogunate. As for whether or not korea wouldve been split up, i would argue that it probably would have. Those in the north, the gogyro, had no love of those in the south, the baekja and silla, since tje two in the south had hooked up with the chinese to destroy their kingdom and unify the penninsula. Living here as long as i have, i know that asians hold grudges for a LONG time. This argument actually reminds me of that scene in life of brian where one says "what have the romans ever done for us?!" To which they list off a number of improvements the romans brought. Did the japanese do some awful things during the time between the annexation and the end of ww2? Most certainly. Were koreans innocent victims for the entire period? Id argue no. Many of the heads of industry here at the end of the war had been collaborating with the japanese the entire time. Ive seen enough pimps around high schools in this country today to know that many of the comfort women might not have had to be kidnapped and hauled off as is claimed. They couldve merely been naive girls who believed some officer promises of a better life. But persuing these lines of investigation into recent korean history will get your tenure revoked and banned from academia here.

Don't. Only touch your own cards and chips. Other players' chips and cards, discards, board cards, the pot and everything else are off limits. It is customary for the winner of each pot to tip the dealer 50 cents to a dollar, depending on locale and the stakes. Sometimes you will see players tip several dollars for a big pot or an extremely unlikely suck out. Sometimes you will see players stiff the dealer if the pot was tiny or split between two players. If you are the victim of such a mistake, call it out immediately and do not let the game proceed. If your opponent is the victim, let your conscience be your guide; many see no ethical dilemma in remaining silent. If you are not involved in the pot, you must judge the texture of the game to determine whether to speak up. In general, the higher the stakes, the more likely you should keep your mouth shut.

The film doesn't linger on much of anything long enough for heavy punctuation: a quick snapshot of his school days, meeting Patti Smith in the park, moving to the Chelsea Hotel, discovering his photography skills. These defining moments pass quicker than you can take them in; the only consistent thread is the lifelong struggle between Robert (played here by Matt Smith) and his father. Yet even this relationship doesn't seem important enough, all things considered, to warrant any emotional investment on our end. Chances are you won't get much out of this cinematic take unless you know absolutely nothing about Mapplethorpe the man.

Had Williamson been jerking off in his own home, no doubt the supposed connection between being naked and "a threat to children" would be written in stone. American children are taught to fear all adult sexuality as predatory, even when it has nothing to do with them. But how exactly would children be harmed by peeping in a man window and seeing him set the coffee to "brew" while he scratched his underwear free private parts? Perhaps the children would be appropriately grossed out and learn not to look into peoples windows? And perhaps they would realize that not all naked men are a sexual threat?.

Anyways, by this point all hell has broken loose in the poker room and all of the games have stopped. Everyone is just watching what is unfolding. Apparently, and I don know this to be 100% true, the guy son was standing right next to him. This was pointed out to me by someone who I believe to be totally credible and who is a local who plays in the games almost daily.

I not OP but a few things that generally apply: 1) fingering her furiously is not generally hugely enjoyable when done as it is in porn where it the only fingering move that they use for a long period of time. We like the hither motion, pushing down towards the base of her spine movement and generally a mix of techniques which includes very slow movement and/or no movement 2) licking of the clitoris with the tip of a tongue in a jabbing motion is not great. Try sucking the whole clitoris, taking long licks with the whole of your tongue.

Yeah, it probably theoretically a fine line to end up here with 4c5c, but it sucks to play. When UTG is a competent player and takes a line like that, you looking at a nutted range. You lead into the previous rounds aggressor who is still left to act, so UTG calling your lead with an overpair would be suicide. That pretty much leaves them with A9s, 97s, T8s, some 33 (if they open these pre), 99, some 66, and 77. 77 would be especially gut wrenching, but could make sense with a bet flop, check turn line.

That's an oft repeated "statistic" that isn't true.

MERS worked well for a long time. The young brainiacs who programmed the coding built it to scale well. And it has. There are millions of homes going into foreclosure.

But now attorneys across the country are arguing that MERS doesn't have legal standing to permit foreclosures. Some judges have rules in MERS favor, others have ruled against the company.

Small cheap games don just fit my constrained time and attention as an adult and caretaker. They bring me back to a personal "good old days" where I was in a community of small time people, making small experimental games. It was the Flash era, the Game Maker 7 era.

While a judge has the discretion to require a single trial, the Appeal Court said, his decision must be transparent so it can be determined if it was legally sound.

When I was in 3rd grade we were pretty broke (Like all of us living in the bedroom at my aunt and uncle house broke) and could barely afford food for the house, definitely nothing for packed lunches or paying for school lunch.

Maybe the best way to go for beginners are the FKK  or Sauna Clubs (FKK is short for "Frei Krper Kultur" and basically means naked).

I think they mean this. Pragmatically, you need to give some response to the recruiter to dissuade their fears about you having the gap because you had a job that you got fired from or something and are leaving off your resume, or are a subpar candidate who couldn find a job.

Our culture has a huge negative bias against time spent not working, even though the first thing basically anybody would do if they were suddenly promised financial security is quit their jobs. A resume is a list of qualifications you choose to present and there no obligation to put something on there that you don want to, or talk about something you don want to (as long as you aren actually lying or concealing a felony or something lol).
Not only the paid idiots, Bryce! Look at all the riff raff coming out of the woodwork here today. I never seen so many pathetic, hate filled losers in all my life! Poor Sandman, sitting at home with his Tivo, playing and re playing the moment to put his own spin on it instead of just enjoying the moment for what it was, a great moment in history. Sure, Barry isn one of the most liked guys in the history of sport. But do you think he cares? Do you think his family and close friends care? Do you think his kids care? And how would all you haters feel if his kids read your hateful drivel and were hurt by your pathetic words? What the hell does it matter to you whether he cheated or not? You have absolutely no evidence that he did. So go cry in your overpriced latte and keep your un intelligent opinions to yourself. Now, lets get on with turning this team around, which means, sadly, eliminating Barry and his overpriced salary and getting young, eager players who act like they want to win. Klesko. Please retire! Benjie, keep up the great work, buddy! You the one bright spot in our stinky season. All you young starters, hang in there. One day you will get run support!

It hard to unpack your comment. You were saying we should build farms and factories for South American? Yeah how about no? If it would be financially worthwhile they would build them themselves.

Tour and sit in a class at the beauty school and at least one massage school. Culture matters too, pay attention to it. Even among massage schools there a wide variety, particularly with more energetic schools vs not. It will affect what and how the teachers teach, and the kind of feedback you get from your peers when you exchange massages.

Of course, since then, President Obama has made a lot of choices that change nothing and actually make many things worse. Obama chose not to pursue the Bushies for their crimes  from torture to lying to the American people and Congress.

Further, although other studies have suggested that CCD related mortality in honey bee colonies may come from bees' reduced resistance to mites or parasites as a result of exposure to pesticides, the new study found that bees in the hives exhibiting CCD had almost identical levels of pathogen infestation as a group of control hives, most of which survived the winter. This finding suggests that the neonicotinoids are causing some other kind of biological mechanism in bees that in turn leads to CCD.

The major challenge for a Bot is to not be predictable. It is futile to play good if you are always playing the same. Your opponents will eventually get the upper hand. Keep in mind that players do take notes and there are also a few HUD type software that collect data on players. This is where I find most poker bots fall short, because most of the poker bots available cannot be customized and have their logic hard coded in the program.

Now, finally, to the last question: Why does Slim go relatively unremembered? While I would somewhat disagree on this, knowing that there has been a resurgence of books and articles on Slim campaigns lately, I would point out this fact. Unlike other famed British generals, Slim was considerably more modest about his achievements. He wouldn actively court journalists or put himself in front of a camera. He was a honest man, not holding himself back from pointing out his own faults (even in his memoirs) and downplaying his own role so that other individuals, who often would remain in the shadows, got some time in the spotlight for their achievements. Slim knew he was working as a team, he did not consider himself a "Great Man" who by pure force, masculinity, and will could shape history. Ultimately, the true credit for his achievements went to his soldiers, a truly multi ethnic, multi cultural army.

"The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will. United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West's critical facilities in the event of a conflict. They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated. In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants."

For my position, I personally do not believe that Cromwell committed genocide, as I have repeatedly stated, for the reasons I have repeatedly stated. They are, in summary, that the genocide happened 200 years after he died, and murder/genocide is a deliberate, intentional act of killing. How can you deliberately kill somebody who isn even born for over 100 years after you die?! In my opinion, murder is carried out by the living, or maybe very rarely the very recently deceased in the case of some kind of deliberate, delayed explosion or something.

They might even give you something to "make it right." But, the way I see it, they could have prevented your dissatisfaction and the blame primarily lies with them, but you also could have prevented your dissatisfaction by checking, which I would encourage you to do.

Yes, TERF, homophobic, and transphobic are shaming. Because it bad to be homophobic, transphobic, or a terf. Duh. Heteronormative is something that describes something somewhat negative, but it more used as a mild call out of a societal issue. It not used at individuals. A person can be heteronormative. It a descriptor for trends and bigger picture things, just addressing the erasure and othering of people who aren straight. It asking for the world to acknowledge that gay people exist. Seems pretty gentle to me.

Serious journalism demands that we ask these questions.Should politicians who purposefully lie to start wars of aggression be executed without trial? After a trial? Yes or no.Should bankers who profit off the misery of millions of people and then pay themselves record salaries be executed? Yes or no.Should these same bankers be tortured? Yes or no.Should Tiger Woods be executed? Or just tortured? Please choose one.Should the journalists who thought debating the execution of homosexuals was good journalism be forced to complete an intensive seminar in ethics? Or should they just be fired? Or should these journalists be executed? Please choose one.The problem with old school, BBC style reporting is that its ridiculous claims to "objectivity" and "neutrality" leave it open to just these kinds of mistakes. The claim to objectivity, in journalism as well as in other fields of inquiry, is based on the belief that a body can rise above its position in the social world and view life from above, an Archimedean viewpoint.But this claim to objectivity is a fantasy.

But it appears any such efforts at cooperation and compromise are far off, at best. At their annual investors' meeting in London on Monday, officials from the Russian gas giant Gazprom said they expect the company's market share in Europe to increase in the upcoming years. And while analysts say they aren't predicting any major EU sanctions against Moscow for the ongoing Ukraine crisis, they suggest any such punitive actions might actually backfire on the Europeans.

I agree that a blanket rule enforcing a 40kph limit past any red/blue flashing light is unnecessary in many situations and potentially more dangerous when the a sudden decrease from 100 to 40 is a risk in itself. 40kph limits past emergency services should be at the discretion of the personnel involved and could be implemented by portable flashing speed enforcement signs when the situation is considered to be presenting a significant risk.

My second problem is that it taking the long road to a one stop solution. The science is in, we need to be emitting 50% of what we were emitting in 2010 by 2030. There is no way around the absolute shock to our entire society that that sort of drastic change is going to entail. People call for carbon taxes as if its some sort of less drastic solution, but it not. The amount of taxation that will be needed to get carbon emissions to the needed levels will be gargantuan.

I argue that with Valor, we already had bad luck protection of a sort. At least you could say "Well if I kill three more raid bosses at least I can get a guaranteed upgrade" if nothing dropped. Bad luck protection as is feels shitty because we can measure it nor influence when it kicks in or what we get. Currency gear had none of those issues. FFXIV still has currency gear and bring able to actually track your progress to a new item feels far better. And any upgrades from drops in the meantime are a pleasant surprise rather than something you agonise over.

In nearly every culture, incense was believed to attract the gods and goddesses, keep evil spirits at bay, and purify both body and soul. Ancient peoples, believing that spirit and life entered the body through their breath, also thought that inhaling certain odors brought them closer to God.

No editing a paper in a hotel room at night doesn violate any Visa laws. Doing work in that country and getting paid in that country is what violates Visa laws. With YouTube you can be paid to a home bank account and then transfer it here, but it pretty obvious what you be doing.

Staying in country, editing uploading making money while in country and staying long term would.

This is the crux of it, imo. The public service wants to present as a modern efficient place to attract top talent but isn't willing to do any of the actual work to make it happen   like modernizing systems, permitting regular telework, and fostering an actual flexible workplace that comes with the modern 2.0 or gcworkplace style environment.
It difficult to look at this rationally when somebody close to you has been hurt by the situation.The tunnels into Israel aren to supplement the economy, those into Egypt though are. There no way to use them to supplement the economy in bringing anything from Israel.

Hunter explains that of the 4,000 native American bee species, none make honey.

Honeybees carry pollen on their sticky hind legs, and it is taken back into the hive. They are pollen gatherers, not primarily pollinators.
I used to turn very red when I drank alcohol. It was not a blush like red. It was almost crimson. From the middle of my chest to the top of my head would turn so red, it looked almost as if I painted myself. Without a shirt on you could see the border line; the contrast was stark. The flush also came with itchiness. I used to scratch my chest, neck, and scalp to the point of breaking skin. I avoided my face for obvious reasons, even though it did itch as well. I used to take Pepcid AC to prevent this, although I did not drink often since it probably wasn wise to ignore such symptoms.
