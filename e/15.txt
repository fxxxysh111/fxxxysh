It ties in better with the wider ranging plot (stopping destruction via the world engine), gives him a clearer arc (the limitation and usage of his power, compared to Zod disregarding use of power) and blends far more naturally with the pull between Jor El and Johnathon Kent, with Clark blending and encompassing both of their worldviews into his own personal philosophy.

Not saying the silence doesn suck, I would think it would, but if you really are so considerate, consider what may be the reason for a woman or couple not responding. Imagine having filtered through vile, hateful, abusive messages for years just because you said "no thank you" to someone. Imagine how horrible all those experiences would have been for you to resort to just deleting and moving on instead of being able to be yourself, be nice to others, and just say a simple "thanks but no thanks."

One of the best things about online poker is it can help you win money more than the amount you can have in real life poker rooms. Online poker, for a fact, is more economical than its real life counterpart. This is because poker sites on the Internet don't really charge people for membership fees. In fact, they even give out bonuses for people who want to register on their site. These bonuses are called sign up bonuses and they can be used to play poker. There are also deposit bonuses where players can have a bonus that would match the amount of their deposit to a certain percentage. With bonuses given by poker sites, players can wager more than their budget and play more games.

Wow, you missing the point again. There a difference between 5bb eff and 5bb avg stack.

Usually businesses grow because someone can do something better than the competition (or creates something new, that newer existed before, but soon they have competition anyway, so they need to keep their first mover advantage). And usually big companies have efficiency problems, because when you small, you can squeeze some time for a quick call with your main investor, a question regarding some tax problem with your accountant, a meeting with your designer about the new company logo and typeface into your week, but eventually you need to find people that you can trust and delegate to..

Tolkien's inspirations were European epics: Beowulf, the Norse Sagas, the Kalevala, the Odyssey, the Iliad, and so forth, along with various folkloric traditions and mythologies as well as his own experiences with war and the conflict between humanity and nature. Lord of the Rings isn't especially "medieval" or otherwise "historical," even if he includes the aesthetics of medieval/renaissance/Iron Age cultures. He set out to create a mythology that would fit in with ancient mythologies and the ways that we humans use stories to respond to the world around us, not to depict a "realistic" medieval fantasy world, and people so often fail to realize that when they try to pit GRRM against him..

Idk personally I think Fahrenheit makes way more sense for day to day life and especially talking about the weather. Think about it. Anything below 0? So cold that bad shit starts happening. School buses don start, pipes freeze, it dangerous to be outside without proper clothing for even pretty short periods of time. Anything over 100 is so hot that bad shit starts happening. Doing anything athletic outside without proper considerations is just a recipe for heat stroke/heat exhaustion, without AC elderly people and babies are at risk of straight up dying, sun burn happens real quick if you light skinned.

So in sum, the British Celtic language imparted so few loanwords into English because 1) linguistic contact often changes syntax morphology, not vocabulary 2) Celtic languages influenced English on two occasions: a phonological influence imparted by a hypothetical Lowland British Celtic language which can be discerned in Old Irish, its closest surviving relative. Celtic didn influence written Old English syntax morphology due to socio linguistic reasons, but did influence Middle English grammar as a result of other socio linguistic phenomena 3) the dialects spoken by Britons in the initial area of Anglo Saxon colonisation may not have been Celtic at all (some form of British Latin) or a heavily Latinized form of Celtic distinct from other Insular Celtic languages. This is why Celtic influence on the English language is incredibly difficult to discern if we assume that the Highland British languages (Welsh, Breton, Cornish) are paradigmatic of British Celtic languages as a whole.

We have to take care of ourselves no matter how we feel. Loving ourselves is not just a feeling, it something that we do. We often love (in deed) everyone else except ourselves   we put ourselves last. Our brains notice this, and so they rank us last too. Our emotions often follow our deeds.

Well, yeah, that the exact argument I making. The roles of other species aren fluid over time. They pretty strictly align to biological sex. In humans, that strict alignment doesn exist. So what exactly is linking the concept of biological sex to social gender? Nothing, except the idea that it should be. that trans people exist and their chromosomal sex doesn correspond to their gender identity (and presentation post transition). And even if these people are a small part of the populace, it a stronger argument than saying "Well, all these other people don really think about it being separate, so it probably not."

Reiki was discovered in Japan during the early 1800's. There are variations of how it was discovered. I was taught, and continue to tell the story of Dr. Mikao Usui searching for how Jesus was able to heal people. I am not suggesting that this is how Jesus healed people. It is just part of the story. The story goes into the steps that he took to find it; who he met to help develop the practice, and the woman who would eventually bring it to America.

Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.

Altogether, some 35,000 Canadians served in the Forestry Corps[2] which eventually was composed of dozens of companies (each composed of several hundred workers). Towards the final two years of the war, more and more Canadian soldiers volunteered for the Forestry Corps, as it was viewed by many as a way to serve the country without facing the German Army in direct conflict. Many members were also underaged volunteers who had lied about their age to be accepted for overseas service, but were strongly suspected to be under the age of 19 and not legally allowed to service in combat. The Corps was not without casualties however, accidents like those which would occur in a forestry camp in Canada were not uncommon: power saws, machinery and transport all took lives. Additionally, particularly during the last 100 days of the War, the Forestry Corps was repeatedly combed for volunteers for transfer into the infantry.

Someone is going to try to make popcorn in their room, and that person is going to fail miserably at it. The plumes of smoke are going to set off the fire alarm, and the entire building is going to be evacuated at 1:30am. Rather than being one of the fools who stuck outside in nothing more than their underwear   and that does happen, you see   you want to be the smug and comfortable individual who laughs in the face of the cold from within your bundle of soft cotton and fuzzy slippers. Then, when you start living on your own, you have something you can wear when you want to relax, and your home will feel that much more welcoming.
