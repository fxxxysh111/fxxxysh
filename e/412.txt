Looking for some opinions. I injured my knee 6 weeks ago while running down a hill. My PT had me do a few test runs last week and the pain came back. They think I have a MCL strain and at least one of the assistants at the PT office thinks I probably tore my meniscus. After reading about a torn meniscus it sounds like the chances of it healing on it own are pretty slim. Would you wait a little bit before asking for an MRI or have I waited long enough for this to heal? Thanks!
Wendi and I found a hostel in the Sultanahmet area that had a bar in the basement! How convenient J Our first day back we walked to the Grand Bazaar to visit our "old" friends from our February visit. They were so surprised to see us, and so happy. Aly, the owner of the leather shop, introduced us to his friend Mustafa. Now Mustafa looks about 50 and his passport says he is 45 but he claims to be 34. Hmm. This tells you how sketchy he is. But that of course didn't stop Wendi and I from going to dinner with him! (Here is where I remind you that I have not earned real money in a year). Mustafa took us to this amazing restaurant and ordered tons of appetizers and kebobs and drinks. I seriously think hours passed and then he informed us that we were waiting for his friend Mehmet.

Massage is nothing more than a way of fooling our muscles into believing that they are working out. The forced movement of muscles causes the brain to release serotonin and endorphins to cover the pain of muscle building. However, there is no pain so we get the 'runner's high' for free. Also, because the muscles are not actually working, they do not secrete lactic acid; lactic acid is a byproduct when one does vigorous exercise. It is not the lactic acid that makes the muscles bulk up but the exercise that one does. Therefore, our muscles actually become more flexible after a massage. Nonetheless, the most important part of a massage is the relaxation factor.

The fact that the Sindhi language, Sindhi culture, and Sindhi socio political discourse at large are so removed from the overarching discussions about Karachi is telling. In these six decades Pakistani historians have lauded the sacrifices of immigrants from UP, Bihar and Punjab. Tributes are even paid to the sacrifices of Bengali speaking Pakistanis   notwithstanding the partition of Pakistan in 1971. But what about what Sindhis sacrificed? Where is that story in the larger national discourse? Think hard..

This is an interesting addition to the collection (though not designated as a category) of several dozen cross section/tomographic/cutaway technical and medical illustration posts to this blog, though this one has a more complicated and perhaps more tragic history than most. It depicts work being done on the ill fated Hudson River tubes, which began life as a project in 1874 with construction starting in 1878; unfortunately there were at least three different companies that undertook the difficult project before going bust, and there was also one major disaster in 1883 in which more than 20 workers were killed. Project got underway for the final time in 1899, and was opened to traffic in 1908.

At least here the women are working by choice, and have health care, pension contributions, union representation and everything is out in the open so the police know who the problem cases are. This could historically be observed in socialist countries: Even though every person has work assigned, no repercussions existed for slacking off or not doing anything at all.

Funny enough, this actually was a problem with a childrens toy about a decade ago. Polly Pockets were these tiny dress up dolls that originally came with rubber clothing. At some point they came out with a line of magnetic Polly Pockets where the clothes would instantly snap in place on the doll. Unfortunately, they used tiny magnets( about 3 mm in diameter) that we glued poorly onto the clothing, resulting in a lot of small children accidentally eating the magnets that came loose. If you eat one magnet, sure, just wait for it to pass. But if you eat more than one, then you have a pair that can snap together and pinch/tear your intestines.

I don believe the current political and economic system in China will be able to govern China into a higher middle income country. China will get stuck soon. However large parts of China is still really poor and there is much growth to be added there if they are able to make those poor farmers more productive. I know the lowest pensions in the country side in Chongqing is merely 100 RMB per month, with almost no medical coverage (only 30 procent on certain services and medicines). Think about that, that is dirt poor. But I don know how they will be able to bring those up to a higher income segment. Jobs will soon start to disappear due to robots, AI and productivity improvements and will probably hit China pretty hard. More and more is going online as well and many people will go out of business.

Supporters claim foot massages (or stimulation via pedicure) induce labor by stimulating certain pressure points around the foot and ankle. Manipulation (even unintentional) of these pressure points, the reasoning goes, causes the uterus to begin contracting. This is more or less based on the principles of reflexology that maintain that pressure points on the feet, hands and ears correspond to every other part of the body. Reflexologists believe that manipulating these pressure points clears up "blockages" in the body's energy field.

Some interpreters consider that in one of the Pauline vice lists, 1 Corinthians 6:9 10, one of the words malakoi ("soft") or arsenokoitai (a compound of "male" and "bed") refer to male prostitution (or male temple prostitution): this interpretation of arsenokoitai is followed in the New Revised Standard Version.The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality states that prostitutes in ancient Greece were generally slaves.[5] A well known case is Phaedo of Elis who was captured in war and forced into slavery and prostitution, but was eventually ransomed to become a pupil of Socrates; Plato's Phaedo is told from his perspective. Male brothels existed in both Ancient Greece and ancient Rome.[5]Court records and vice investigations from as early as the 17th century document male prostitution in what is now the United States.

Saying "yes" to everyone in every situation is not an option.

For a hair and make up team that hadn't styled a show professionally to date, the IFAP's team debut was worth acknowledging. The red lips from L'Oreal's versatile 'I am Red' palette and simple kohl lined eyes were well executed. The hair could have benefitted from some fun summer styles such as messy braids instead of the poker straight look that all the models wore but according to Mehreen, the idea was to keep it deliberately simple. "We did about 200 different looks, not just for the two segments of the fashion show but also for some of the guests who were part of the event. It was a proud moment for me that the team pulled it off and managed to stay calm despite the immense pressure. With this out of the way, I know we are ready for bigger things."

I don think we know enough about the OP to decide whether he is irrationally or rationally depressed. From his point of view, he done nothing worthwhile. The question is, why? Is this because he thinks there is nothing worthwhile to do? Is this because he has crippling social anxiety that prevents him from doing what he likes? Or has he done things but in retrospect it is not worthwhile because he thinks of himself as worthless? I think professional counseling can be really helpful with gaining some perspective.

Manage the end game: You need to know how much money you have remaining, how much money other teams have remaining, and especially how much money your key rivals have remaining. And for the record "key rival" is not the person with whom you talk trash; rather, he or she is the fantasy owner who needs what you need. If there is one good shortstop left and you and your adversary both need a shortstop, it makes sense to call out that shortstop if and only if you have more money than your adversary. If not, wait to see if your adversary spends his/her money on another need and this gives you the financial advantage

In the Dark Ages, the [literacy] rate was around 6%. Today about 0.5% of the world can read and write with a computer the computer literacy rate is less than the actual literacy in the Dark Ages. So when [computer scientist and pioneer] Alan Kay says that the computer revolution hasn't begun yet, I think we are advancing into a world that is going to be completely defined by software, by digital. And we don't have a society that is literate in these technologies. You hear those buzzwords, along with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a lot these days. Almost every company is talking about them. Companies like IBM with Watson, Google with their Brain group and Microsoft are active in this field. How do you see Infosys differentiating itself in this world, to set a value proposition that is unique?

I admit it. I will never understand how the US government, especially the Congress and the Supreme Court, work. Take their notion of the First Amendment. v. Stevens. The legal issue is whether Congress infringed on First Amendment rights when it passed a law outlawing the distribution of images of animal cruelty for profit. These images include videos of dogs, pit bulls mostly, killing other animals, including dogs. Apparently people buy these films for pleasure. Justice Antonin Scalia said that the court needed to consider "the right of people who like cockfighting, who like dogfighting and who like bullfighting to present their side of the debate."

As much as anyone, Rivers Cuomo established the contours of the modern rock hit as we know it, and as punishment he's doomed to dopily haunt its commercial confines forever. Despite his aptitude for tune, Cuomo's lyrics have always stumbled, and their gawkiness only simulates a vulnerable charm if you first encounter them at a particularly susceptible moment. So maybe schtick rock throwaways like "Zombie Bastards," "Can't Knock the Hustle," and "The Prince Who Wanted Everything" (somebody's surely rolling in his Paisley Park shaped urn) aren't exactly unworthy of the auteur who once sang "Flip on the telly/Wrestle with Jimmy" after all.

Some massage chair manufacturers use terms that cause skeptics to bristle. One of those terms is reflexology. Reflexology is a practice that focuses on the belief that specific points on your feet correspond with other parts of your body. Some practitioners of reflexology claim that they can help relieve pain and other symptoms throughout your body by rubbing these points on your feet. Skeptics question the validity of reflexology and suggest that the only benefit of having someone or something rub your feet is that it feels nice.

When it needs to run the country, the mutilation of the Pakistani Constitution (and thereby of Pakistani democracy) comes naturally to the military. Responsibility for a mutilated Constitution does not lie solely with the military, but is shared by those that have enabled the process of mutilation.

He and his colleagues at McGill have identified 10 genes associated with pain response, and researchers elsewhere have identified another 50 or so, but there are still thousands more awaiting discovery. The rest of the variation is environmental, driven by factors such as age, diet and, most importantly, prior experience with pain. In general, the more pain you experience, the more sensitive to pain you become.There are, however, some intriguing hints that the long hours of training endured by Olympic athletes produce the opposite effect.

Not really sure how statistics from thousands of years ago relate to today, with completely different technologies and challenges. Not to mention the examples you gave didn really work. After the building of the great wall, Mongols just went around it and overtook China anyway, establishing the Han dynasty. And while the Spartans were able to effectively funnel the Persians at Thermopalye, they pretty famously still lost and got slaughtered to a man. Walls don fix anything, they just delay. Many (not all, but many) of Central America current problems are direct results of American interventionism, from our early days of expansion all the way through our propping up of dictators in the Cold War. We were tearing down and rebuilding Latin governments as recently as 40 years ago, and that just the incidents we know about. We majorly destabilized large chunks of Central and South America, and the immigration we see today is a result of that. We empowered ourselves at their expense, and most immigrants are simply looking for the prosperity we stole from their parents, grandparents, etc. The $5.7 billion Trump wants for his wall would benefit America a lot more if it went to foreign aid designed to improve life for Central Americans. If they could prosper at home, there would be no need to immigrate. Immigrants will always exist, and as humans they can adapt. Walls cant adapt, they just stand there waiting to be overcome, as they have been throughout history.

In astronomy, we use a couple of coordinate systems to map the sky. One is the Celestial coordinate system. This is very much like latitude and longitude, but reversed. If you imagine the Earth was transparent, and you were sitting at the very centre of the Earth. The latitude and longitude lines crossing the Earth surface would appear superimposed on the stars, and gives you a coordinate system for the sky. There are two coordinates for this. Declination is how far "north" or "south" of the equator the star appears to be. Right Ascension is how far "east" or "west", and a Right Ascension of zero is defined as one of the points where the equator of Earth intersects the plane of the Earth orbit (the ecliptic). If you add distance to this, that gives you a 3D coordinate system.

All right. So you saying that gender roles for humans aren biological, and you also saying that trans people exist. What it comes down to, I think, is that simple biological statements that are true in 99% of cases are still 100% false when you don acknowledge the 1%. Rewording your statements to say "Only women can bear children" or "Only men can inseminate women naturally" is wrong if you accept that trans women are women and trans men are men. If you accept that, if you believe you should call trans people by the proper pronouns, if you think that for non medical purposes we should identify trans people as the gender they identify with, you will inevitably include people in the category of who have vaginas and ovaries and people in the category of who have penises and testicles.
