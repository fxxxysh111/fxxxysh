A star weighing one tenth as much as the sun would produce so little energy that it would not be visible, and the largest planet, Jupiter, is already so small that it could not maintain nuclear reactions at all. This rules out the possibility that the earth atmosphere, or the ocean, or the earth crust, could be set "on fire" by a hydrogen superbomb and the earth thus be converted into a star.

I don think you know how the previous Net Neutrality rules were applied. The FCC applied about 4 or 5 full rules from Title II and 10 or so partial rules. This legislation reinstates the Open Internet Order that was over turned by the FCC and puts ISPs back under Title II with the limited rules. The Open Internet Order was fairly simple with rules that limited ISPs ability to block, throttle, and obstruct legal traffic along with disallowing paid prioritization. You come to understand the FCC is given legal rights to enforce NN and given the ability to make regulations under title II.

I mean, in TF2 (I talking team fortress, not Titanfall) the Heavy has a hitbox probably 3x the size of the Scout but it completely balanced since his DPS is higher by the same factor.

For example do you recall the Martin Bashir documentary? It made him look pretty bad at times, but then the full tapes got released and virtually nothing in the original was true, it had all been edited extremely carefully with little bits chopped out that entirely change his answer etc. MJ or his lawyers/estate insisted everything for that doc got filmed by at least 2 sets of people. Everything was blown away when you see the full tape, so much time was spent misleading MJ before getting to a real question, it was horrific, anything Bashir might have had that was incriminating was swept aside by his awful desire to make MJ look bad no matter what he said..

And sometimes, I just wanna lift at some unsanctioned meet at some small gym to have fun but there just no easy way to find out about them currently.

But why are these notions stronger here than in France? Why is "childhood" not held sacred in the same way and why is it not invested with sexual purity in the same way? The answer for that lies in the Victorian Age, of course. Part of what Victorians did in the US and in England was to create racial hierarchies based on sexual ones. White people were sexually more controlled than racial others, but white women were sexually innocent and pure BECAUSE they were childlike. The conflation of white female purity and childish sexual innocence got tangled up with notions of white superiority over "those people" whose children had sex and women were promiscuous. This was at the center of the drawing of the color line in the US, but it was also at the center of Empire in England.
The first week is over with. I had nightmares every night were I experience the pain and suffering not of myself but of others. But last night the nightmares stopped. I went into the cage of a teenage girl this time, and watched as the demon started the session. He stabbed a knife into her stomach and twisted it. The girl wailed and I winced, but the pain wasn what I expected. The pain was definitely there, but it wasn pain like I had experienced before this time. The pain throughout the entire session had started to numb, just a tiny bit, and that tiny bit was replaced with something I hadn experienced in a long time, enjoyment. I felt nauseous, infuriated with my own feelings. What was happening to me? But that when I realized, that this, "punishment", wasn meant to make me feel pain. I became so disgusted with myself I threw up in the cell. This didn feel like my punishment because it wasn my punishment. It was my training.
Studies often are used to distinguish between environmental and genetic influences on medical disorders. Identical twins share nearly 100 percent of their genes, and fraternal twins share about half of their genes.In both cases the siblings early developmental environment   both in the womb and after birth are very similar.Several small twin studies in the past decade looked at how common it was for twin siblings to share an autism diagnosis, and results of those studies placed genetics as the primary cause of autism.But some scientists believe that those studies weren large enough to note the differences in shared diagnoses rates between identical and fraternaltwins.The new study is the largest, and the most diverse, to look at twins.Of the 192 pairs of twins in the study, 54 were identical and 138 were fraternal.

In particular, on exchanges that favour the maker in price improvement (do the opposite of what I believe Bitmex does), you end up with stupid situations where the price drops 90% because someone accidentally put on a sell order with a missing zero, and the exchange did the trades at the erroneous price instead of walking down the order book from the best (highest) buy price..

I love sports because of the stories and narratives; peaks and valleys of teams. It a wild, emotional ride, and having peripheral view into other teams narratives is great.

On April 27th I put in my two weeks notice at a call center I worked at. I had cleaned my desk out in anticipation of leaving, and on April 28th I walked in, worked half of the day, and then clocked out and went home without saying a word. A few co workers then messaged me on facebook telling me they wish they could do the same.

If, for example, I somehow came around to changing my mind on the ordination of women, I simply could not continue communing in the Church of Canada, let alone remain in the Anglican Communion at all, because the issue goes to the foundations of doctrine and principles and the very legitimacy of the Communion, not simply about whether or not, by accident or design, I happened to only be at services with male clergy.The whole thing is ecclesiastical nonsense. 1 point  submitted 1 day agoWhat if there no church within distance that the person fully agrees with? For example, this gentleman seems to be one hundred percent okay with the Anglican view of things except the ordination of women and, if I may infer, probably LGBT affirmation.

A long time ago, someone on one of the LGBT subs made a post saying they were raped by a man, and when someone else commented that that person had a reddit history of mocking and laughing about rape and rape victims, and I pointed out that it was sad and maybe they could learn from it, that user went kinda nuts and started saying that everyone on that sub was saying that he deserved it and was celebrating it because he was a "conservative" (not, you know, because of his mocking of rape victims), and tried to make it only about politics and Kavanaugh. He went to a bunch of right wing subs to complain and show how bad "liberals" were and got them to brigade the post.

Terry Davis, of the Metro vice unit, said his recommendation today would be no different than in the mid 1990s."You're asking for more problems in regards to instances of prostitution when you allow cross gendered outcall," Davis said.David Lee, director of business licensing for Henderson, said the potential for illegal sexual activity is there in either case."Everyone worries about outcall cross gendered massage, but even with same sex massage you're never going to be 100 percent sure. There's always a few bad apples, but that shouldn't spoil the whole barrel," Lee said.Statistics from Metro Police suggest that there are several "bad apples" in the outcall massage industry.Sting operations during fiscal year 2000 2001 involving some of the 160 such licensed businesses in Las Vegas and Clark County resulted in 70 arrests for prostitution, according to records provided by police. Vice detectives were asked to pay for sex after contacting outcall massage establishments advertised in magazines, the phonebook over the Internet and elsewhere.Those arrests represent an "infinitesimally small amount" of related prostitution that goes undetected, Sgt.

In the last 24 hours I come across two antiquarian outlooks on the longevity of the world coal supply after not having seen hardly anything of the sort written in the 19th century. (The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy".

Again above, Wolves defensive 5 3 2 shape has shifted right across to the left to stifle Arsenal, who do the logical thing and try to switch play to the opposite flank.

Repeat this 5 times.Again, do 5 days run and one rest day over 4 weeks, going from 2min to 1:50, 1:40 and 1:30 for your recovery walks.You covering more than the 1500 m total distance, but the recovery walks help to bring your heart rate back down.By doing this, you burn fat, tone and strengthen muscle, increase your strength and stamina over the distance without burning yourself out. Continue to increase the distance and reducing your recover times in 4 week sessions.As you get better, you find that your recovery takes less time and you not as tired from the distance.See about pacing yourself for the full 1500m once every 2 weeks.

That aside, I want to share something with you that I think is really important. Everyone is always dreaming of becoming a millionaire. You can ask anyone if they would want a million dollars and they would all say yes. They think it's going to solve all of their problems. But then if you ask another question   what are you doing to get to a million dollars? A lot of them won't be able to tell you that answer. A lot of them will say, well, I'm working a nine to five job. Yes, I get it guys. But I don't think you're going to get to where you want to be working a nine to five job. I truly believe success comes before nine and after five.

That's a classic narc move: weaponizing therapy. They're totally dishonest from the get go, and they see therapy as yet another chance to run game on a particularly challenging mark. Some therapists are experienced enough to be able to see through them and Dx them and this can be massively threatening to a narc's sense of invincibility. They rarely admit such a Dx to others. Or, they go in the opposite direction and totally embrace their Dx because it gives them a universal excuse for any sort of crap narc behavior. No therapist would ever sanction this, but all of a sudden, every tired excuse gets assigned to "their diseeeeeaaaaassse". And then there's that old narc favorite whinge: "But the therapist saaaaaiiiid" as a one size fits all solution to all criticisms. Therapy with narcs is almost always a losing proposition. At best, they'll simply refuse to be honest and avoid any real work. But at worst, they will dig right in to the delicious opportunity to weaponize therapy, and learn a whole new lingo, skill set and techniques of furthering abuse, and avoiding consequences.
Use a strategy list. A strategy list is like a cheat sheet, that has all of the different ways you can win in a poker game in a list ranked from best hands to worse hands. Using a cheat sheet will help you determine which cards to keep and which cards to exchange for new cards.

The conceit of the game central factional squabble   Stormcloaks vs an Empire   is evocative of the same ideological tensions around through which so many of us live today : Nationalism/Globalism, Racism/Multiculturalism etc etc. Even in a very specifically American context, the colors of the game factions are Red and Blue.
"We in it for the long haul" was a pretty blatant attempt at telling the community that they will continue to work to address the current concerns regarding rank and balance (without outright saying it). We all know why they won communicate more directly, let just give it some time before we write it off. The game is incredible, it just requires some (fixable) tweeks. Absolutely unreal how toxic this sub is. I curious why all of the swim haters even bother frequenting the sub if they believe their own claims that the game is dead.
I can shake my head, roll my eyes and wag my finger all I want, but it would be immoral to do anything more than that. 
For this scenario, is the value of blockers mostly for higher level play? ie. Villian will continue with all hands in this particularly range or hand grouping (A,B,C etc.), the same way, so we can effectively give less probability to select holdings because of less combos? I have a very tough time thinking that I get value by utilizing the concept of blockers in this particular facet anywhere other than a certain higher level of play (to which my skill level is certainly below).
That includes some high intensity intervals. Between lower body moves, Lee might hand Kourtney a medicine ball and have her walk on a treadmill inclined to 15 percent or do a minute of jumping jacks holding five pound weights.

As may be expected, if you have an entire game room dedicated to poker, than you are likely to want several decks of cards to put in the room.

This Truth Commission, led by my own Senator, Patrick Leahy (VT), is an absolutely necessary part of the cleansing process that must take place to remove torture from official US policy. Of course, torture will remain "unofficial" policy at the CIA, but at least it will be unofficial.

Run gains its strength from Maren uncompromising storytelling and her insistence on showing even the most painful realities, especially when Jodi finds her grandmother land with disuse.

Think of it like a movie. The Torah is the first one, and the New Testament the sequel. Then the Qu'ran comes out, and it retcons the last one like it never happened. There's still Jesus, but he's not the main character anymore, and the messiah hasn't shown up yet.
"Definitely most of the clients we see are pokie related," he said. "But we are seeing an increase from sports betting which I think comes down to ease of access.

Too much feminine energy would be "Barbarellas at the Gate" and they wouldn't be knocking   they'd be immersed in their feelings, paralyzed that any action may offend someone. They would call a group meeting to discuss things once again, long after it was time to make a decision. With too much feminine energy deals don't get closed, decisions don't get made, and prospects are never converted to clients. An overabundance of feminine energy, therefore, doesn't work either.
I must say that I never seen a map of "Relative Brunetness" before finding this one, today.

I slept on it and honestly I like the way you played it more. At 100bb I think we could 3b flop and jam most turns, but this deep I don think its a good idea to 3b the third nuts, especially in a spot where the off suit combos of the other two nutted hands are possible. If we compare this to a spot like CO vs BB on a 456r board where we hold 23s on the button and V should not have any combos of 73, and only the suited combos of 78 we could much more reasonably 3b the flop. V would only have 4 combos ahead of us where in the spot were in V could have up to 32 combos ahead of us. I think in reality Q8o doesn always call and KQ sometimes 3bs so its probably closer to half of that but you can see it still a huge difference.

Not all of these off shore banks and fund transfer services are safe to use. How can you tell the difference? Research the bank or service to find out how long the company has been around   the more established, the better. It's a good sign if you can speak to a real person when you call the company's customer service line. You can also search the Internet for complaints about scams or poor service.

I actually grew up with my dad family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

My (supposedly non denominational) officiant was told in no uncertain terms that the brief ceremony was to have no mention of God or religion. She sends me the first draft, several mentions. I edit it and send it back, she says ok, but theres a nice poem that not really religious but I love to read it at ceremonies called in the sand Can we add that. I familiar with the poem. It about God carrying a man through the hard times in his life. I don see how this has anything to do with marriage and I said no. I asked that she instead recite the Dr. Seuss Weirdness poem and she says she edit it in.

I should fired her after she pushed so hard on the God issue when we were negotiating the script.

Acupuncture. The use of acupuncture and acupressure is thousands of years old. These therapies were developed in ancient China and are based on the theory of energy flowing through a system of channels (called meridians) that flow through the body and are linked to certain internal organs. Disease is seen in large part as disharmony in this internal energy flow, and the purpose of acupuncture is to restore the balance. Acupuncturists may do this by using needles, finger pressure, heat sources, or other methods to manipulate certain specific points (or acupoints) along the meridians. Western scientific research is still at a loss to explain why acupuncture works. Some theories suggest that inserting the needles increases the body's production of endorphins (substances that make you feel better and more comfortable) and blocks the transmission of pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain.

Your example assumes a person is "gambling" for ideal Pokmon moves by buying raid passes   and you're right, someone stubborn with poor gaming strategy and a liberal budget could decide to play like that. The same person could also decide to spend $1,000 on lures hoping to spawn a Charizard and cry that lures are "loot boxes"

It sounds like you are talking specifically about a tour that includes the JSA. Those tours are run by the UNC/USFK. There are many reasons why they may close and they don give much information or advance notice. Frustrating, sure, but understandable, considering that you are visiting an active war zone.

Yes, I still in Vegas and I suppose that has me thinking about how out of place I am here. I never feel more like a New Yorker than when I enter the upside down world that is Las Vegas. My stupidly somber clothes of black and brown clash with the pastel mini skirts and stiletto heels that constitute daily attire for everyone between the ages of 10 and 75. Here people openly drink breakfast, gamble away tons of money, and seem to have not gotten the memo that allowing thousands of people to chain smoke in enclosed spaces is not a good idea.

If I absolutely must, I cut it into tiny pieces.

Just about every business owner I ever spoken to has a red tape story. Some are run of the mill not being able to navigate government websites easily, getting different answers to the same question from the Canada Revenue Agency, and filling out mandatory surveys from Statistics Canada that are excessively long and complicated. The more troubling stories threaten the viability of businesses with little recourse. They often involve overzealous inspectors applying rules capriciously or governments publishing contradictory information.

I also not a super big fan of so many people who do not put enough expert in learning how to deal with pit bull breeds taking one   but I think there is also a constructive way to deal with that from my side if I walk dogs.

Maybe a bit of a shame, but there should hopefully be some open spaces in Noord which you and your dog can enjoy :).
