Cracker is weird because he was built up to be the most defensive based character in the series so far yet he was a glass cannon in the end. He could make a seemingly infinite amount of shields and at the time of the fight his armament haki was portrayed as the strongest seen so far. Luffy comments on how it the hardest thing he ever hit. 
And while I could hope he made a flush on the turn, there aren't actually many flush hands he could have here either. I need to be more disciplined about looking at the situation (what hands would he play this way) rather than focusing on how few hands in total have me beat..

The 25% withholding rate for supplemental wages was changed to 22% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And that for federal income tax only. Social Security, Medicare, and state taxes are additional. Also, this is just withholding. When it comes time to file your 2019 tax return, this gets lumped in and treated just like all the rest of your ordinary income. If you end up being in the 22% marginal tax bracket, then it will turn out this withholding was correct. Otherwise you owe more or get a refund.

Tales spread of rape, mutilation, and murder, and the police set out on a relentless mission to bring someone to justice. Six months later, two local men Tommy Ward and Karl Fontenot were arrested and brought to trial, even though they repudiated their "confessions," no body had been found, no weapon had been produced, and no eyewitnesses had come forward.

Honestly, something like this is so trivial that you really don't even need to let it become a "thing". Your kids watch what you deem appropriate for them while they're in your care. They watch what she seems appropriate when in her care. 
After the blinds and antes (if applicable) are placed, each player is dealt two down cards (called hole cards). Then each player starting with the player to the left of the big blind has an opportunity to call (place an amount of money equal to the previous player's bet) the big blind, raise the bet (to place a bet higher than the previous player's), or fold (resign from the round of play). When the action (or betting) gets to the player in the small blind position, he/she can call the partial bet they initially placed, raise the bet, or fold. The player in the big blind has the option to raise or check (to decline to bet) if there are no raises as he/she already has a full bet in the pot. Any player who calls the big blind and has the pot raised behind him/her then has the option to call the raise or reraise the pot.

Surprise, surprise, this has a habit of happening after he loses a pot of course. Eventually I couldn't listen to him any more. After making derogatory comments about the dealer for the second hand in a row, I tried to explain that the dealer had no control over what appears on the flop. (and none of us would want to play in a game where they had !). As usual my timing was off, and Phil blew his top. The self proclaimed best player in the world, was now proclaiming to the whole room that he was more of a man than I'll ever be, and that goading someone after losing a pot was totally un excusable. And I hadn't even realised I was goading him. Well I was speechless (honest guv, I was lost for words). This was one of those times when American and English were completely different languages again. I honestly had no idea what planet he was coming from. There are definitely some major cultural differences here. I went to bed on a little bit of a downer for the first time since I arrived.

River is interesting because it makes it so we lack a lot of natural bluffs. I probably significantly under bluffing this river due to incompetence. Hearts make really bad bluffs because they block folds, and all our premium bluffs just made a straight or a pair. I think I actually making some mistakes on the turn by not barreling combos that would be good river bluff candidates on this card specifically. Seems like we probably need to go back and add some J9s, Q9s in order to barrel the J and Q rivers effectively. I pretty much just thinking out loud lol. I dont mind your bet size but I think something slightly larger would be more optimal. Straights are likely close between over bet and bet 70%. PIO does prefer a jam but the population is for sure over folding and you have two cards you really want your opponent to have. As an exploitative adjustment, based on your lack of history with this guy I might just pot river to squeeze a bit more value and not worry about him figuring out some crazy secret to your bet sizing schemes.

Attrition ranged from 10% to 48%, where reported. The longest duration of follow up assessment was three weeks after intervention.

Expanding and promoting charter schools as a system though, especially when prompted in contrast to public schools, is almost always a tactic to undermine the public system, rather than address a particular need. In the US charter schools have been extensively promoted to support education privatization. Here in Alberta charter school promotion appears to significantly involve promoting religious schooling, and seems to dovetail with opposition to things like GSAs and modern sex ed curriculums.

I like the idea of the story being focused on exploration, since that was one of my favorite elements from the first game. I know Bioware loves its grand, world changing plots, but a character focused exploration mission is what I wanted from this series since the first game was teased. They tried to go that route with Dragon Age 2, and while the execution left something to be desired I think it shows they capable of breaking away from the "go to various places to find a secret way of defeating the Big Bad" plot..

Worst case, the Costco kiosk should have a dedicated T Mobile representative that can help out here. Maybe a three way call with you, the TMO rep, and the promo team might get the issue sorted out.

Yeah, I think the "ephemeral" quality of Sazae san where every episode is one that you watch and then is lost forever is (though not necessarily part of it initial success) a bit part of why Sazae san continues to hold such prominence in the rankings.

In ternion there is no underlying big story, no ideology or philosophy, bar the implied nihilism, explicitly alluded to in Ray Brassier quotes (nihil unbound): "Philosophy is dead.

Also if you are playing live, your sample size is much smaller so if you don't have a significant edge over the field than you will be experiencing a longer downswing in terms of time opposed to number of hands. For instance you played 380hrs of live poker last year and with an average of 30 hands/hr that's a little over 10k hands in a year.

So it takes approximately 150g of soy to get the same amount of protein (20g) as 80 90g of meat. The average person needs approximately 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight, which is estimated to be 46g per day for women and 56g per day for men on average, so for the sake of math we say each human needs, at minimum, 50g of protein/day. 50g of protein means that each person would be eating (if we are talking soy alone and ignoring amino acid deficiencies) 375g of soy per day to get their recommended protein intake.

Even with all that said anime has approached WWII both directly and indirectly many times. Zipang and Barefoot Gen woud be direct ones. In Zipang a modern warship gets sent back in time and they have to decide if they really want to help Japan win the war knowing the bad stuff the Empire did. Barefoot Gen meanwhile is about the nuclear bombing but a lot of it, and a even more of the manga, is focussed on how fucked up Japanese society was during the war. Oh and there is that one segment of The Cockpit which is about kamikaze pilots and hows how fucked up that whole situation was. Finally you have real roobot shows of which I say about a good 60% of them (well pre 2004 shows anyway) in some way are about the war. A lot of the early and mid generation of directors were extremely anti war due to their personal experiences and would often put critiques of the Japanese Empire into their shows in more subtle ways, because of course these were still kids shows after all.

If you've carefully crafted a response for the OP and it gets removed for one of many possible reasons, which can range from your standard MIL pologizing which doesn't mean that you can't supportively make suggestions about tips or tricks that you found helped you to train communicate better with your MIL for example, but that your phrasing may be more on the lines of what the OP hears all the time, and they're here to avoid. Things such as "Well, your MIL seems like they're being helpful!" when in fact your MIL's actual help in private consists of telling you the exact spot between her hyacinths and her rose bushes for you to place her cross, and by the way, can you just kneel down in her 100% organic BetterThanYours brand soil and give her a boost on up? type wording is what they already hear at home. Or a common removal is shaming. Remember that we're existing in a text based space. What your inner voice reads one way may read entirely differently to others.

The key is to design unique and interesting molds that create an engraved impression (known as mold marks) around the chip. You need to make sure that your Poker chip Sets are not simply boring flat smooth discs. The mold marks provide the chip with an identity even before you place the inlay. Casinos use a mold mark for uniqueness and branding. If your chips do not have mold marks, then they will not look or feel authentic. Mold markings give a poker chip texture, security and authenticity. Mold markings give poker chip sets a personality.

It is more expensive than excess baggage (for my 50 pound dog, it was $1000 versus $600) but the staff are experts in transporting pets and they arrange the journey to maximize the comfort and health of the pet. My dog got potty breaks, an overnight hotel stay, and walks.

This be an unpopular opinion, but I always saw the wink wink nudge nudge Stan Lee cameos as similarly distasteful. (Especially so after learning about how he didn necessarily have it all together in the later years, and doubly so when I heard that they prepared footage to continue inserting him into films after his passing.) It just an awkward cult of personality thing and it always stuck me as dehumanizing in a way. I get that he was deeply invested in the Marvel universe and probably loved the cameos, but I always had the sense that it just wrong.. 
It's all about making memories for me and living in the moment, but making sure I don't do anything dumb that could ruin the rest of my life..

Clear back when being overly phlegmatic was considered a sign of good health, Hippocrates penned On Hemorrhoids, a seven part treatise on the diagnoses and treatment of ass flowers. The preferred method of treatment   apart from dousing the afflicted butthole with boiling water and urine, which was another acceptable remedy   involved heating "seven or eight small pieces of iron" until red hot, puckering the patient's veiny starfish as far as it would pucker, and going to town on it like a line cook at Sizzler. 
Talking about short marriages in ancestry, I had an ancestress in the 1800s who got married at 12 and was widowed in less than a year and a half. Her sister had made a dying request for my ancestor to marry the sister widower, mostly so she knew her 2 surviving kids would be safe if her widower died. 
After sex, she watched the clock and said, that there are 10 minutes left she began to talk and massaged me again. 
It is worrying that medical students are graduating with little or no knowledge of the communities we will be serving, let alone how to provide care that ascribes to the highest standards of clinical excellence. How does someone's gender identity affect the medical history that I take? What are the questions that I need to be asking and how do I frame them in an inclusive way? What about the physical exam? What does a gender affirming medical intervention look like? These are fundamental questions, among others, that all medical trainees must be prepared for.

"For decades our father was reluctant to sell the film rights to 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' because he believed that it could not be made under the time constraints of a feature film, or that producing it in a language other than Spanish would not do it justice," Garcia said. "But in the current golden age of series, with the level of talented writing and directing, the cinematic quality of content, and the acceptance by worldwide audiences of programs in foreign languages, the time could not be better to bring an adaptation to the extraordinary global viewership that Netflix provides."

The claim by the Catholic Church and many conservatives that homosexuals are more likely to molest children is simply not true. Fact, of all the respected studies of child molestation and sexual orientation done, none have established a connection between homosexuality and child molestation.

While he billed as a contemporary classical composer, his music makes use of certain progressions and added tones that are more common in pop music and film scores, less so in classical music. This strikes a balance between old and new, and appeals to audiences who like the sound of classical music, but who eventually get turned off by the musical content of it.

I not trying to be obtuse here, I get your concerns, but you were in another thread just claiming that these claims came randomly out of nowhere. That clearly wrong when you look into the logic of the claim. So you seem to just be defaulting to a contrarian perspective because of this general pattern you notice where people believe anything they see, but you havent actually taken time to explore the detail of the particular example you championing against.

In a healthy relationship, when your SO tells you they are upset/in distress to the point where they are depressed and sobbing, you would be spurred into action.
