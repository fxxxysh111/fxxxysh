Me and one of my friends caught you playing at a corner table on day 4 and you had a 15 minute conversation with us. We were a few of the first people to sign up for bluefire at the time and you took the time to answer some f my questions. I remember telling you (in my expert 50 PLO expert mindset) that I had starte trying to up variance in matches where my opponents had to wide of a range oop because my edge would be so much bigger deeper. You looked at me and said "yeh that could work, just be careful because variance is crazy in that game and you could lose your whole bankroll".

One tip that sometimes helps with this is leaving your horse by carcasses you still need to skin. Same goes with deer if I kill one and have to track another. As far as animals spawning I have no idea, I had times where I circling the swamp and nothing, other times I have gators popping up at my feet.

Numerous times in the TF2 universe the Heavy does some class A stupid shit. He a moron more often than he is intelligent in his actions.

Eliminating the plastic shopping bag devastating our water courses and our landscape is beyond our national capacity. We can't control the wall chalking which disfigures our towns and cities, proclaiming instant cures for such unmentionable maladies as haemorrhoids and sexual inadequacy.

Goody for you." It hard to tell, but maybe one last poke at your gray rock to see if you will give it up? Or using sarcasm as an outlet for her anger that she couldn provoke you? Regardless, I think you are doing great! Gray rocking, relentless positivity, acting confused/literal, and refusing to allow myself to be provoked into an angry response have worked very well for me with my waif mom, and I think it a good combination. 
I understand the controversy around fasting. I'm using the OMAD right now because I'm with you, I prefer not to calorie count. (If my schedule worked with lifting, I'd be down with calorie counting because I believe muscle gain has to be fueled properly.) But I don't talk about it because I want to model good eating habits for my kids, and OMAD and its cousin fasting are not in anyway presentable as healthy for healthy weight minors. Especially when they have friends who are borderline anorexics. Luckily with them in school and me at work all day, it doesn't come up, and I cook a relatively healthy dinner every day.

(Main reason): getting squeezed sucks, and snowie does it to itself often. It also happens a lot in 50NL+ online games.

What initially looked like a disaster/cause for panic was a blessing in disguiseAs it was good film making, donations poured in. His work was shared far and wide.

"Propositional Thought," is characteristic of the formal operational stage. Children can now evaluate logical propositions. An experiment that illustrates this was done with poker chips. When the statements, "The chip in my hand is either green or it is not green" and, "The chip is my hand is green and it is red," children in the concrete operational stage would generally assent to both propositions provided the chip was hidden in the experiment's hand. Formal operational stage children on the other hand recognize the impossibility of the second statement. This shows the beginning of formal logic at work. Children at this stage also develop their ability for abstract thought by studying Algebra and Literature replete with metaphor, simile, and personification.

That is, if straight people are attracted to the opposite sex and gay people the same sex, what happens when you attracted to someone who is both or neither? Perhaps it is this discomfort that led the Human Rights Campaign Fund to cut trans people out of its campaign for a national Employment Non Discrimination Act (ENDA).

Sleep posture, carrying something frequently on one shoulder, talking on the phone without a hands free headset, or typing without having the forearms supported can cause the muscles that elevate the shoulder to go into spasm (sometimes chronically) and make it difficult to turn your head.

Male Byleth is an avatar for male players, and while he certainly pretty attractive to many women (and men, of course), he also not off putting to the male players who he is foremost geared toward. If female Byleth is supposedly an avatar for female players, then she should reflect what female players want   and if she not, if she meant to appeal mainly to male players because "they make up most of the playerbase" or something, then maybe we should really reexamine our priorities.

Many women find it empowering to take control of their sexual identities   on their own terms, it should be noted, and not the terms of others. What I saying is that I think female players want female characters to be treated with the same level as respect as male ones and it certainly seems that many female players (including this one) think f!Byleth got done dirty.

I mentioned on another thread that casting a non white actor in a role explicitly described as white by the source material seems to hold more inherent biases than simply casting a white actor.

When you get to the river there are two mistakes that you can make. One is to call a losing bet, which will cost you the price of a bet. The other is to fold your hand, which will cost you all the money in the pot. Obviously folding your hand will be a far more costly mistake then merely calling a bet. If there is a slight chance you may have the winning hand you should call. I'm not advocating calling with nothing but you should call if there is a chance to win. .

Know your opponents. Everyones chances of hitting a four card open straight is twice as likely, because it has a place open at either end to complete the hand; for example, a hand of 4 5 6 7 can use either a 3 on the left end or an 8 at the other to complete the straight. But, an inside straight only has one space somewhere in the middle that must be filled to complete the hand; 4 6 7 8 needs a 5 and nothing else to become a straight (half as likely)..
