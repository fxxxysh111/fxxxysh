I suppose then "no indication" might be a little strong, but I only revise it to say I don think there is strong indication in either direction, and am unconvinced by the rhetoric that the USSR put out   even if it were honest, I think it only honest by virtue of the fact that NATO and the US especially was there to make it non viable. 
Most people tend to carry stress in the muscles that elevate the shoulder blades. Sometimes, even minor "drama" cause the shoulders to creep up towards the ears! Sleep posture, carrying something frequently on one shoulder, talking on the phone without a hands free headset, or typing without having the forearms supported can cause the muscles that elevate the shoulder to go into spasm (sometimes chronically) and make it difficult to turn your head. 
I get what you're saying that there could be some kind of "expert mode" where you don't want to be protected by the oversight. but how do you manage that and what do you do when someone inevitably gets hurt   because they didn't understand to the same rule set as their opponent. or say they didn't as an angle shot?
This gives you an indication how avalanches have grown larger and larger with each big loading event.

So what we have here is Zulfiqar Mirza, otherwise a political non entity, become a national figure based on his specific targeting of an ethnic group and the largest representative political party for that group.

[It pretty obvious that Neelix is reverse bluffing here, and he might be overdoing it. Since he obviously does know the rules and strategy my guess is that he really was unfamiliar with the game but they been playing for a little while now, and he read the rules. Neelix knew some pretty tough weirdos and probably got into a few scrapes. Even if he not a gambler, it reasonable that he been around gambling and can pick up on strategy quickly, especially since so much of it is seemingly a "mind game."]

I guess you have a point, but eventually somebody might to find a new technique exclusive to Ultimate that turns out to be better than wavedashing. I'm glad melee players are giving Ultimate a chance, but even with the weaker dashdancing it can still be utilized. I just don't understand why it's so adored that people won't move on. I love Melee too, and stuck with it even throughout Brawl and Wii U (only playing those ones for some new haracters or for story mode really), but I was ready to move on with Ultimate. I don't know why it's so hard for so many peopleThis is all true but it doesn really disagree with what he saying. Movement is just a unique aspect of melee, that doesn necessarily make it more or less unique than other games.

To me, America is supposed to be a place where we can go where we want and do what we want without the government constantly monitoring us.

Ok but what if you get a remote speaker and set it to play some preset audio files at random times. Hide it in your city at very difficult to find places and if the cops don find it, move it every few days to different locations and hide it again.

What parts of the pictures do you want to include or leave out? Be sure to leave room for a title or name if you want to include that (for example, you might put a title such as "Sage's First Birthday"). Keep an eye on the colors: are you grouping all the blue toned photos together? Do you have a big spot of brown toned photos? Spread the photos out to balance the color across the entire collage. 
I don think Never3forget will need a visa as the nature of his work is not contingent on South Korean labor laws. The nature of the work is not for the benefit of the South Korean consumer or the public.

Never3forget will not sign any contract with the Korean government, corporate or private entity that lawfully governs employment. Never3forget will also receive no statutory benefits from the Korean government such as the right to join a union, file for worker compensation, etc. There is no reciprocal benefit. Also, F series visa has nothing to do with temporary or long term employment.

According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently "humanized" and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. For example, attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.[165] In contrast to social democracy, democratic socialists advocate a post capitalist economic system based on either market socialism combined with workers self management or on some form of participatory economic planning.[166] 1 point  submitted 9 hours agoYeah just stay on the outside of the line.

A manuscript of the study was published online ahead of print by the journal Pain on April 29. "In other words, our results suggest that in some individuals something goes wrong with the body's 'fight or flight' response or the body recovery from this response, and persistent pain results."The study assessed the role of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, a physiologic system of central importance to the body response to stressful events.The study evaluated whether the HPA axis influences musculoskeletal pain severity six weeks after motor vehicle collision (MVC) and sexual assault.Its findings revealed that variation in the gene encoding for the protein FKBP5, which plays an important role in regulating the HPA axis response to stress, was associated with a 20 percent higher risk of moderate to severe neck pain six weeks after a motor vehicle collision, as well as a greater extent of body pain.The same variant also predicted increased pain six weeks after sexual assault.now, if an someone comes to the emergency department after a car accident, we don have any interventions to prevent chronic pain from developing, McLean said.

OTOH, polygraph testing CAN sometimes produce valid results, because skilled polygraphers use the machine as a prop to convince people they can get away with lying, and get the people to confess on their own.

Corn, tomatoes, beans, it had all grown here, but when the heat lamps turned off, it all turned dead, dead, dead. In the corner nearest them, Sera kneeled and sifted through a bag of seeds. Wil appeared at her shoulder, and pointed to the far side of the cave.

Researchers looked at 2,734 mothers who had their children at Boston Medical Center between 1998 and 2014 and had at least one follow up visit to BMC. Of those, 102 children received a diagnosis of ASD. The women weren't asked if they were overweight at the time of pregnancy, for example (because, frankly, who would answer that honestly).

The IMF had set meaningless quantitative targets in designing and approving the EFF programme on September 4, 2013, and has since shown great in monitoring them to help the government keep the programme operational and raise foreign exchange resources to repay its debt. As the government failed to meet even those meaningless targets, the IMF came to its rescue in each of the last five reviews of the programme.

GCJN needs yet another new car/has a substance abuse habit/wants expensive man toys but "doesn't" work/needs to buy his way out of any number of JN bullshit situations/has bail/court fees/prison costs that are ALL sooooo much more important than the educational needs of his siblings.

In addition to the fact that racing dogs are injured, GREY2K objects to how long they're confined (more than 20 hours a day), the poor quality of meat they're fed, and the fact that the only reason they're racing, for the most part, are that state laws tie gambling licenses to tracks. Though their physiology is incompatible with hot or cold weather, the dogs are made to run during temperature extremes.

Once you put in your actual expression of interest, that is when things will get interesting. Even if you put in your best price, the agent will probably think it wasn't and even if he or she does believe you, his or her vendor probably won't.

Pod systems (like the Juul and other devices being used by teenagers) do not have any kind of history of blowing up, unless some dip is drilling through the battery, spoiler alert but you crack open a battery with a drill it's gonna vent. Now where you have heard of vapes blowing up is in user error within whats called a mechanical or "mech mod" A mech mod is a device, normally a tube, that has absolutely no form of regulating chip set or circuitry inside. 
As you become more experienced, you will learn to read situations and know what is going to happen. A common example of this is when you have a top pair and a good kicker or two pair on the flop, which contains two cards of the same suit. You bet on the flop and are called. You bet again on the turn and are called. Then on the river the third card of a suit hits making a flush possible. After you bet again, the person who had been calling raises you. In low limit Hold'em, this means a flush will beat you almost every time. The only time you may not be beaten is when a solid player feels that you are capable of laying down a good hand for one bet and is bluffing you because of the scare card. This is often not the case. Situations such as this are learned with experience. So practice, practice, practice.

In the intention to treat analysis, on average, the largest Cobb angle decreased by 1.2 in the Schroth and increased by 2.3 in the control group over 6months, and this difference was statistically significant. When only completers were considered (n=44), this difference was even larger (4.1) suggesting the importance of compliance with the treatment. So how meaningful is that if we apply it to the reported Cobb angles at the start of the study of 28.58.8 degrees. 
Imagine how tough it is to see what your generation has done, and be the minority opinion within that group? I feel like that would be pretty tough, so I try to bridge that gap and learn from them as much as possible.

Taking away the africans, that hardly "immigrated", we are talking about 99.9% europeans. So, saying that "many people from all over went to america   but yeah, europeans were a majority" is misleading. For all they were worth statistically, no one from the whole world went to americas and US in particular until very recently, and the englishmen   europeans were not a majority, they were the population.

Lap 3. Oooooo things started to be a bit of a grind. I passed by the mystery bearded man again. Ok that has to be Cody Reed. Super cool that I'm racing a Coconino Cowboy, but I knew he was hunting me! I needed to push if I wanted to stay in front of him and show that I can run with the best. But I could feel the gap was closing. I was slowing down. I kept up the gels and hydration and continued trying to stay cool. On the climbs my groin was super tight and painful though. Not pleasant at all! Regardless, I kept fighting. At this point I was just hoping to have enough of a lead to hold him off. About 500m 1km from the last aid station, I took a look back. Bright orange shorts, there's Cody. He's pushing. I figured it was a matter of time before he got to me, and then I'd have to see if I could hang on.

It may also have helped protect us from the elements   oils in our hair could help keep warmer air close to the body, keeping us warm if it cold or wet out. A lot of that is mostly irrelevant now that we wear clothing, as well as our development into stamina based hunters who needed to be able to pursue prey long distances without overheating.. 
Didn't Brandi said last season that LeeAnne also trash talked Stephanie and said Stephanie wasn't a good friend to Brandi. To me it seemed LeeAnne tried to widen the rift that was already between Brandi and Stephanie. She has been horrible to Brandi and Stephanie (and Cary) from the first season and I think Brandi has a hard time seeing genuine change with LeeAnne. Not sure that Brandi pointing out every flaw in LeeAnne is good for their dynamics but I can kinda see where it stems from.

I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own.

She admitted she has done this for a long time.

His "concessions" are actually acknowledgements of the existing injunctions issued by the courts that are preventing the government from actively destroying these policies in the first place, but with promised timelines that extend beyond Trump term, and are therefore irrelevant.

Shortages are not exclusive to socialist economy, capitalist society also have it and transmit it via inflation. Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and Weimar Republic happened because of supply side shocks.

In this world, we'll experience a reality forged from the physical world around us and the digital world we create to exist on top of it. We'll be able to view this world dozens of different ways. By 2050, it's not unreasonable to guess that we could have eye implants allowing us to see the digital world without the need for a display. Even if we decide that altering ourselves is ethically questionable, we can achieve a similar effect just by building display capabilities into a pair of glasses.

Most game historians disagree with the above and state that poker is from an 18th century French game called "Poque", and yet others reference a German game that involved bluffing called "pochspiel" and some even say it is derived from the Hindu word "pukka". The opinions continue with some referencing the word poker came from an underworld slang word "poke" a term used for pickpockets and "hocus pocus" the term popularised by magicians. There is no clear links and no definitive answer; it is safe to say modern day poker arrived from an amalgamation of many different games and words.

"O est all Dieu ?" s'cria t il, "je veux vous le dire ! Nous l'avons tu,   vous et moi ! Nous tous, nous sommes ses assassins ! Mais comment avons nous fait cela ? Comment avons nous pu vider la mer ? Qui nous a donn l'ponge pour effacer l'horizon ? Qu'avons nous fait lorsque nous avons dtach cette terre de la chane de son soleil ? O la conduisent maintenant ses mouvements ? O la conduisent nos mouvements ? Loin de tous les soleils ? Ne tombons nous pas sans cesse ? En avant, en arrire, de ct, de tous les cts ? Y a t il encore un en haut et un en bas ? N'errons nous pas comme  travers un nant infini ? Le vide ne nous poursuit il pas de son haleine ? Ne fait il pas plus froid ? Ne voyez vous pas sans cesse venir la nuit, plus de nuit ? Ne faut il pas allumer les lanternes avant midi ? N'entendons nous rien encore du bruit des fossoyeurs qui enterrent Dieu ? Ne sentons nous rien encore de la dcomposition divine ?   les dieux, eux aussi, se dcomposent ! Dieu est mort ! Dieu reste mort ! Et c'est nous qui l'avons tu ! Comment nous consolerons nous, nous, les meurtriers des meurtriers ? Ce que le monde a possd jusqu' prsent de plus sacr et de plus puissant a perdu son sang sous notre couteau   qui effacera de nous ce sang ? Avec quelle eau pourrons nous nous purifier ? Quelles expiations, quels jeux sacrs serons nous forcs d'inventer ? La grandeur de cet acte n'est elle pas trop grande pour nous ? Ne sommes nous pas forcs de devenir nous mmes des dieux pour du moins paratre dignes des dieux ? Il n'y eut jamais action plus grandiose, et ceux qui pourront natre aprs nous appartiendront,  cause de cette action,  une histoire plus haute que ne fut jamais toute histoire."

Your aunt recollection of being "brainwashed" at school is likely accurate: Nazi Germany was a totalitarian regime and used a combination of propaganda and indoctrination to keep the populace pliant and loyal, and schools were required to teach Nazi ideology. I once interviewed an old gent who grown up in that time: a Jesuit priest who had been stationed there used to give him and his classmates "Bible study", but in fact he would ask them what they learned in school that day and proceed to tell them why it was all wrong   this was possible, because the Nazis were at the time leaving the Catholic Church alone.

Had an ex who was German so his English was fairly good but not as good as mine (my first language) and he would use the word "annoying" to describe something when he meant "interesting" or "worthy of note." For example, he referred to the way that I speak (high voice) as "annoying." Another time he said that he was "annoyed" to learn that I had taken him to a vegetarian restaurant. As an inveterate people pleaser, I spent the whole week I stayed with him worried that he was displeased with every thing I did or thought about. Despite my repeated attempts to explain to him what the word really means and let him know politely that he might accidentally offend some native English speakers he kept using the word often.

Play "tight"/seeming real, conservative (not loose) most often, then go strong, convincingly at the opportune moment; so your opponent gets "that sick, losing feeling"   believing you have another good hand, fearing and avoiding a big risk, and so they fold (that's how a bluff can work).

The best way to pick one is by the sound, or timbre, of the instrument, and the best way to choose is by having all available instruments played to you by an experienced musician. There are also a few physical restraints on what kind of instrument someone can pick; certain mouth shapes are more well adapted to playing, say, oboe, rather than flute, and some kids just will never have the arm length to play the trombone.

I worked as a host for Red Lobster in college and got accused of being racist multiple times for seating people in the back of the restaurant. The reality was that our servers each had assigned tables they took care of and as a host my job was to stagger the seating so that the servers had more or less equal numbers of tables. This also was for the benefit of the customer as it allowed servers to manage their tables easier and give more prompt service.

While in land based casinos, the only problem you face when it concerns your bankroll is, well, your lack of money. In virtual poker casino, the deposit limit of the online site really does affect the game you are playing. Even if you're always winning and even if you play aggressively, you can lose all your online bankroll money and you cannot play anymore because your deposit is gone (even if you have cash available).

I looked after a patient who required recurrent ascitic drains and I became increasingly aware of the physical, psychological, and emotional impact of this process. Following NICE approval of long term drains, I was keen to set up a service to prevent patients going through this awful experience repeatedly, described by one patient as a "recurrent gauntlet." The opportunity to undertake a quality improvement project seemed ideal, so a core medical trainee colleague and I developed a proposal. The project was supported by a coordinator who linked us to an appropriate supervisor, explained the quality improvement framework and project structure, and communicated regularly with us to deliver ongoing support. We had regular meetings with all the departments involved, gained insight from patients, liaised with the drain company representative, and developed a pathway and education strategy.

What might establish the peripheries of this question are books that keep intact a belief system, or way of life, a secret or not codification of a state of well being? A Bible? Alcoholics Anonymous? Probably that is the first place to visit, the religious book, though offhand it seems that the travel of this sort of book wouldn transcend one owner. The Bible and company are enormously popular books and have been printed no doubt in terms of billions of copies, so they have a much better chance of being the leader of the category by sheer numerical possibility.

Or at least a good example of its kind.

The stakes are big, but not as big as the Senators grilling Sotomayor or the academics slugging it out in articles and lectures believe. The problem with these life or death fights over whether objectivity is possible is they not really life and death at all. In the end, an epistemology of objectivity turns out to be a standpoint epistemology. In other words, you believe objectivity is possible or not depending on your position in the social world, your standpoint. If you can escape embodiment through claims to a superior way of knowing, you will.

The next important element to choosing the site is to find out how many people are playing on the poker site. I mean, you need other poker players to play poker right? The more players are playing, the better it is to find a player to match your skill and competency.

Aurilia pinch hits for Ishikawa: Anyone else think it was odd for Bruce Bochy to pinch hit for Travis Ishikawa that early in the game on Sunday? I mean it was the 4th inning.

Calgary Zoo attempts to breed giant pandas from China
First, calculate your pot odds. Pot odds are the odds that the pot is laying you to call a bet. For example, if there are 300 chips in the pot, and your opponent bets 100 chips, then you'll be putting in 20% of the total value of the pot (100 chips into a 500 chip pot). Implied odds represent the money that will go into the pot after you catch your draw. The problem with this is that you don't always know how much money your opponent is willing to put into the pot. Sometimes he is bluffing and will fold to any bets from you. Other times, he'll give you his whole stack. Fortunately, there's no guesswork required. Calculating your implied odds accurately is relatively simple. First, look at the size of the pot after calling. Second, multiply the size of the pot times 0.6. This reflects the size of your bet on the next street. If your opponent is aggressive, use 0.8 instead. If he is passive, use 0.4. Third, add this value to the size of the pot and calculate your pot odds again. For example, if there are 300 chips in the pot, and your opponent bets 100 chips, and he is aggressive, your pot odds are 1 in 5, but your implied odds are more like 1 in 9, so you can profitably call with a lot of hands that you would have folded because you have a more accurate representation of the reward of calling.

Poker, however, has many rules and hands that have to be remembered so that one could be able to analyse and act according to the situation. The strategies used while playing poker varies from person to person depending upon their skills which can be called as poker playing personality, and a person must develop his poker playing personality before attempting to play in serious poker levels. This is usually the reason why people in India prefer to play poker at home rather than playing straight away in a casino. Playing poker at home not only improves the poker playing ability of an individual but also helps him to generate new skills while playing poker. Playing poker at home cost a person less money than playing at a casino.

After escaping from the Maze, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his friends (including Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie Sangster, Ki Hong Lee and Dexter Darden) find themselves in the Scorch, a wasteland created by some sort of environmental catastrophe. They're rescued by Janson (Aidan Gillen) and taken into a sort of halfway house for lost teens, where Thomas meets Aris (Jacob Lofland), a loner who knows something nefarious is going on. Sure enough, the monolithic corporation WCKD, run by Ava (Patricia Clarkson), is using these kids because they are immune to the disease that's turning people into Cranks who maraud across the landscape. 
One lesson to be learned from this tendency is to occasionally vary your own play so an opponent can't easily read your hands. Usually making a play that is contrary to your normal playing style is only necessary about 5 percent of the time to keep your opponents guessing.

Indoor workers, on the other hand, have a much safer and more satisfying job. According to the research from GWU, indoor workers have a low risk of STDs and are rarely targets of abuse or violence. This happens in part because of protections set in place by the industry itself; clients are vetted by gatekeepers and word of mouth between workers. Additionally, most workers have a small pool of regular clients. These returning clients pose a substantially lower risk than new clients found on the street.

This disease is the worst. And we all had moments that we never get back from it.

But I also have grown up watching my mom support him in every step of the way. They been married for 30 years. I 26 and still am struggling with it, but I now taken the approach that I am just honest with people about my disease, not in graphic detail, but I tell them I have a stomach condition, I have a lot of pain, I have to plan things carefully etc. I recently had the opportunity to sit in our Provincial Legislature for a work event and I got to hear a Member of the Legislative Assembly stand up and speak about IBS and shove it in people faces that people with IBS are suffering in silence and are struggling in their daily lives. They were promoting IBS Day and I have never felt so happy. Stigma is lessening, people are not as horrified anymore, they more accepting. I heard there is even a dating app for people with IBS.

Although bad experiences (such as anxiety and agitation) are more common on 25x NBOMe due to adrenergic agonism causing unexpected stimulation, LSD itself binds to both 5 HT2a and D2   meaning it should have a higher risk for psychosis.

It not diversity that Canadian universities are after though, precisely the opposite. I think it has been meritocracy for admission process at the least, with grants being handed out on a more subjective ground based on needs and political minority status. It may just be that Chinese students, or rather east/southeast asian students are among the more successful ones in testing. There may be reasons for that that need scrutiny and perhaps Canadians could borrow the good reasons to apply to Canadian students. They may not all be good reasons, perhaps Asian families doing more to groom their kids for academic success (which isn necessarily a good predictor of academic performance or value).

In fact, the real world effects of the federal government spending more than 50% of all tax dollars on defense and defense related industries, not just in VT but everywhere, is that the US government must engage in constant and permanent war to defend such expenditures.

Guess I should identify what "new" means here I talking about the third decade of the building, the first of which (for all intents and purposes) could be identified as William Jenney Home Insurance Building in Chicago in 1885, which was 10 stories and 138 high. (There are couple of other earlier and qualified contenders for "first skyscraper", but for here the Jenney building will work fine.)

Jan McMillen: Well, problem gambling in Australia in the past it's been seen as some sort of mental disorder or addiction very much based on literature and research that came out of the United States.

Similarly in poker, for decades, the highest level of pokers have been dominated by players who have learned the game by playing it, "road gamblers" who have cultivated intuition for the game and are adept at reading other players' hands from betting patterns and physical tells.

Applying the tools of computer science and mathematics to poker and sharing the information across the Internet, these players have challenged many of the assumptions that underlie traditional approaches to the game.

[Dr. Nikoli Bogduk is an anatomist and surgeon from Queensland Australia. He is an internationally known expert in the pain management world the world of anatomists. He and his cohorts were the first to document the presence of nociceptive nerve fibers (pain fibers) in the human disc in the late 80 His discovery revolutionized the management of axial complaints (spine) and has offered us great insight into the nature of the spinal discs and facet joints as pain generators. The result has been a tremendous increase in the number of pain management techniques. As important, we now have a scientific basis the axial complaints of our patients and can better explain to them the reason why pain exists even though objective studies (MRI, CT, X ray, EMG, etc) do not show fractures, disc herniations or nerve damage.]

What if Hayes finds "The tape", or a similar tape(seeing THAT might be enough for Hayes to lose it murder a suspect). That be a good way to tie the seasons together without it being too heavyhanded. Matthew Mcconaughey says he wants to play Rust again, Dorff is saying Nic thinks it be cool to bring the characters from different seasons together in the future, and Nic said he was going to do a movie and some other projects after season 3, but says now he might change his mind because he has a crazy idea for season 4. I think finding the tape or a similar one in the possession of Hoyt (played by Michael Rooker, who tends to be typecast as a redneck psycho), would be a good way to hint at it. It could stand on its own, or be a link to S1 if they do decide to mix the stories/casts.

The 1913 locomotive acquired by the Alberta Railway Museum in 1971, which served in the Edmonton area in the 1950s on work and weed trains, will be back in action as part of the Rails and Tales Canada 150 celebrations.Along with the 1920 Baldwin 41 owned by Alberta Prairie Railway, the steam locomotive will operate several passenger trips June 28 July 5 from Stettler to Big Valley, including lunch and dinner trips, a morning cruise and a historical site viewing trip.But first, it has to make the two hour trip down to Stettler and the first part of that process happened Wednesday, when it was loaded onto two lowboy trailers, one for the locomotive itself and the other for the tender which contains the fuel and water needed to run.After four hours, the 55 tonne locomotive was hoisted securely on the trailer with a few bumps along the road.When moving the locomotive out of its storage at the museum yard in the city northeast at 24215 34 Street, it took several attempts to keep it on the track at a switch. After several different tactics, a backhoe had to physically move the track to make it less sharp of a curve.But Terry Wolfe, in charge of the steam locomotives for the museum, said this wasn something they couldn overcome, even if it was a larger challenge than they were expecting.the thing actually about railroaders, he said.

You've decided on a trade and have even investigated some potential schools and programs. What's next?

Your idea of buying a SFH to live in and fix up is a good idea. If you work with a Realtor you will probably find a few homes in the area of your choice that have been sitting a while because they are outdated and could use your modern vision. In a home like this you could also rent out a room or two while you are doing your renovations and this will help offset your mortgage expense.

I've never understood where Vito was (or, better yet, could have been) hiding just before he appears seemingly out of nowhere, pops Jackie Jr. in "The Army Of One". It doesn't add up: A.) It's broad daylight on a narrow street up a steep hill. B.) Vito ain't exactly a small guy. Vito was there, but he wasn there physically. The thought process changed once Jackie Jr. starts walking. The visual prowess adds a different part to the whole scene. At one hand you see Jackie resistance to comply with the rule which can be called a Machiavellian art, on the other hand you see or should I say, don see Vito Spatafore who tries to end a major no no by dislocating Jackie from this world. The snow adds a different dimension as well, as it claims that the environmental circumstances could have prohibited this from happening, but it could have not prevented either.

Since poker became the "big game" in Las Vegas, many people are buying chips for home play. An interesting way to do it is to literally buy them from the casino and take them home with you. Use them for your home games, and if you ever stop playing, or need the money, cash them back in at the casino you got them from for full value. Don't worry about the changes a casino may make, or even the possibility of a casino being sold or closed down. This would only make your Las Vegas casino poker chips even more valuable
