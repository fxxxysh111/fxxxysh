For example, you could spend 150 EUR on training sites over some number of months, play a ton of hands, get a bunch of practice with the concepts, then pay a good coach 100 EUR to review some hands, look through your database to plug leaks, etc. Then you could invest another 250 EUR plus HALF of the money you make in poker into content, coaching, whatever. That basically the offer you should compare to something like BPC. The first option will have much more flexibility overall and less risk, especially in the short term.

The distinction I want to make is that GTO, by definition, is inherently non exploitive (while exploitive should have roots in GTO).

Hope is a belief that what we do might matter, an understanding that the future is not yet written. It's informed, astute open mindedness about what can happen and what role we may play in it. Hope looks forward, but it draws its energies from the past, from knowing histories, including our victories, and their complexities and imperfections. 
But even without that, I found that the quality of the apps, and the overall experience, were nowhere near that of what I had become used to on the iPhone.

This is interesting because Trump story will obviously be "well we didn know they were illegal foreign contributions". But, there no way these people set up shell companies to disguise themselves from Trump. Makes no sense to make illegal contributions to a politician committee if that politician doesn know you contributed. You can call in favors later if your donation was anonymous to the President. So they had to know at some level that these were strawman donations from overseas. I wonder what the paper trail will show.

That a much more nuanced argument since soy and other plant based protein sources, contrary to popular vegan belief, are not "complete sources of protein" (meat is), as they lack two of the nine amino acids, specifically methionine and lysine. So soy alone would not suffice, and more sources of plant protein would need to be consumed to make up for the lack of amino acids one finds in protein rich meat. This goes without saying that it takes approximately 150g of soy to get the same amount of protein (20g) as 80 90g of meat.

After the treatment Ajaan Fuang visited her at the hospital. She told him that she had been able to concentrate her mind so as to endure the pain, but it had left her exhausted. He advised her: "You can use the power of concentration to fight off pain, but it squanders your energy. You have to approach the pain with discernment, to see that it's not you. It's not yours. Your awareness is one thing, the pain is something separate.

There is a word we used to use for this thing where corporations gave you large sums of money and you then voted in favour of their interests. It almost rhymes with "library".

Let say you raise and make it 7.00 to go. Everybody else folds except the BB, who calls. There 15.00 in the pot, 3.00 is raked from it, so the rake is 20%. The flop comes, the other player checks to you, and you going to bet. How much should you bet? The standard play here is to bet somewhere around half the pot; perhaps slightly more. If you bet 8.00, and get called, the pot would be 31.00, and the rake would be 16.12%. If you bet 7.00, however, and the villain calls, there is 29.00 in the pot, and the rake is 13.79%. In both cases, let say the Turn card comes out, you bet, and your opponent folds. Over the long run, that roughly 2 1/2% difference in rake between dragging a 29.00 pot, and dragging a 31.00 pot adds up, and most players never even consider it.

So. I was maybe 5 or so. My sister is 2 years older than me so 7ish. My parents were on vacation for the week and left us with my aunt. It was during the winter and not Christmas vacation yet so we still had to go to school, but the deal was as soon as we got home from school we would go tobogganing (Canada!) down the hill behind our house. Well. My sister came down with some sickness I can remember which and ended up staying home from school. I still had to go. So the school bell rings and I catch the bus and little five year old me is just vibrating from excitement for today after school activity. I get off the bus and run home and burst through the door. Just in time to see my red faced aunt and sister taking off their wet snow suits after an afternoon of tobogganing without me. I still am and will probably forever be bitter about that bullshit.

It been a while since I used Redux, but I guessing you could define a reducer that does something similar.

At her age 66, Louisa will be able to receive employment pensions of $5,666 per month plus $976 CPP and $570 OAS. Harry is receiving $912 from CPP and $600 from OAS. All this adds up to $8,724 per month. On top of that, they would receive rental income of $1,600 per month to make total income $10,324 per month. Add Harry RRIF drawdown of $560 per month and they would have pre tax monthly income of $10,884 or $130,608 per year. Assuming that this income is fairly evenly split and pension and age credits applied, they would have annual individual incomes of $65,304. After 20 per cent average tax, they would have $8,700 to spend per month. That $1,300 below their $10,000 monthly after tax income target.

As a beekeeper who has a top bar hive and a langstroth hive,I have to say the only thing I disagree with is the queen excluder. It is so much easier managing the hive with the queen excluder.

Of course the hive is designed to not be opened by humans, if they were left to their own devices and never opened it would of course work perfectly fine for them.

Felonies. Yes we all know people who have them and some for really good reasons. But I don think this should be an excuse to take away your right to vote for life nor your Second Amendment rights for life. Now, hear me out. Look at all the felonies we have in this country. Is it fair that someone who commits fraud should no longer own a gun or vote? I can understand if you go in with a pistol and shoot up a 7Eleven, then I think you shouldn be allowed your weapon for a while but still, you should be allowed to vote. I think for Second Amendment rights it should be by the crime and once you have done your time, you should be on a list for like 7 or 10 years and if you don do any more crimes after that, then your right should be reinstated. We hold judgment over people even after prison which is wrong. Would you hold that same judgment on your child who just got out of time out? No. You move on and if they keep repeating the pattern you do your best to change the behavior. This is the same with prison. Some people never learn and we know this. But others do, and I think they should be given the respect they deserve. If you think about all our laws and you think about all the things that could make you a felon, then you will see what I am talking about. You could someday be in the same situation, wouldn you want dignity and respect once you came out? Wouldn you want your right to vote or have a firearm? We all would and we all should.

A family in my church had 12 brainwashed kids. I'm amazed they were never on the news for their shenanigans. They decided that the oldest daughter would be allowed to go to college. I was surprised at this and wanted to know all about it. She was going for business management and God had told the mother of this girl that she was going to open a "Christian family restaurant" that they would all work at. I asked what would specifically be Christian about it. She said it would have a dress code mainly for the women and only let in people who were modestly dressed. I waited to hear the rest but that was it. Sounded like a fun place. The girl ended up moving in with her boyfriend and scandalizing the family.
