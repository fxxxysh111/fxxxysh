Though, if you don think they ever have bluffs in their range, blocking 54 isn a good thing since that just leaves them with higher aces, so you should shift A5 and A4 to other higher aces. I think they could conceivably have bluffs here though, like turning any x3 or x2 into a bluff would be pretty baller. 2 points  submitted 11 days ago.

Prey is a struggle for survival where mugs, plants or even medikits can burst into life and attack.

Dim the lights. Before you begin Make sure you really are comfortable and relaxed, and have everything to hand. Do a bit of deep slow breathing to make sure you're not tensed up. Undress your baby. Pop a clean nappy under the baby's bottom Warm up: shake your hands vigourously to loosen them up. 
For me, this really is the top explanation. Even though a casino or poker area is suitable down the street, you might be going to become restricted within the games that you can play. With limited game choice comes limited options for making cash. You'll generally have to pick among a game that's not really lucrative and not playing at all.
My uncle was a cop and while he didn't have that much exposure to gangs, he said two of the main reasons for people joining are money and sense of pride/belonging. Usually people end up making a lot more selling drugs and running than if they get a job.

The CPC director buying lunch for the young woman is not done out of kindness, it's because if the clinic performs surgical abortions with sedation, there is a requirement to fast prior to having the sedation.

Together we fought, working out way through many adventures, until we had toppled the Tyrant King himself, and set the whole Empire free. Or at least so we had thought. With the leader of the country usurped, the world was left in a state of Chaos, one in which the Guild stepped up to the plate. My friends, recognized for their good work, were instated, along with Atlas, as one of the major players in the Guild, becoming world leaders, practically overnight. With my goal behind me, and that rage, slowly fading away, day by day, I slipped away, finding myself a nice quiet place, away from everyone and everything else. I still kept up to date with the news, of course, but my name wasn't remembered the way that theirs had been. I had the luxury of a nice quiet life, and I had given up my dream, for a second chance. All of my friends, had seemingly forgotten about me, just like all the rest, and a part of me was fine with that. They all had lives to live, and with so much life in them, it was only natural that people would gravitate to them. I was never really quite that way. I stayed to myself, and fought out of necessity, not enjoyment.

Somebody might have borrowed it and not yet returned it? Maybe call up the neighbor and ask him to return the poker table now? Or ask one of your poker buddies to bring his poker table with him?

When OLGR assesses individual tax rebates, the audit found that they are "based on minimal evidence" and "there are no procedures in place to provide an objective review". The department told the auditors that a lack of resources meant it was "difficult to conduct a thorough review of the tax rebate returns." There was a "lack of transparency" in how funds were spent in Category 2   which attracts the highest rebate of 1.1 per cent   because there were no guidelines as to how they should be administered. Last year, the guidelines for what money can be spent on were altered to include spending on projects such as club sport, golf courses and bowling greens   and even wages paid to staff to carry out maintenance. 
When four hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium, .7 per cent of the mass is transformed into energy. But if four helium nuclei were fused into oxygen, the mass would decrease by only .1 per cent; and the fusion of two two silicon atoms, if it ever could occur, would release less than .02 per center of th emass. Thus there is no prospect of using elements of medium atomic weight for the release of nuclear energy, even in theory..

The preference for the award is in astronomy specifically, to the person/s who could successfully contact an alien civilization. That contact however does not include Mars. It was during this decade especially that there was much debate about the atmosphere on Mars, and whether it was vegetative, and whether there was an intelligent and advanced society capable of construction was what was seen by some as a massive system of canals across the planet. So with this in mind, Mme. Goguet Guzman like many others assumed that there was some sort of life on Mars, and so Mars was excluded from the prize for contacting an extraterrestrial civilization. The notice that Mars is excluded from consideration of the 100,000 franc prize, and in the event that no one wins another award would be generated from the interest compounded by the prize deposit every five years to a deserving person in science and medicine.

This sounds like someone is trying to drum up outrage from innocent banter. First, obviously he was not serious, since negotiation is serious business.

They may never be as magical as things feel from back then, but maybe they shouldn't be anyway.

Female Common Buzzards are larger than the males. They nest in trees and lay up to three eggs over a period of a week. Both parents spend time incubating but the male fetches most of the food while the female stays with the eggs for most of the time. The eggs hatch after about a month, and the chicks can fly at about the age of 50 days. They are fed by their parents for at least some of the time until they are about three months old. The oldest Common Buzzard known to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) was 28 years old.

Following the Supreme Court's decision to sustain President Obama's Affordable Care Act, allowing subsidies for poor and low income people everywhere, the country is taking fewer wobbly steps as a comprehensive health care nation, while little known parts of the ACA still teeter to find balance. Sen. Tom Harkin (D IA), Section 2706 is the "nondiscrimination clause" of the ACA, which ensures broad spectrum complementary and alternative medical (CAM) care to non subsidized health insurance plan members, without discrimination.

When playing against tight players it is usually pretty easy to assign them a range. If a nit calls you they will likely have a pair, Broadway cards or a suited Ace. Against the calling station it almost impossible to assign them a range because they are playing such a wide, creative, wild and ambitious range. For example, the cutoff opens, you three bet the button and a calling station cold calls out of the big blind.

I been to the San Diego zoo and it seemed like all the animals were healthy and fairly comfortable. Some of the exhibits for the big cats seemed way too small to me, but otherwise the animals appeared well cared for. And the amount of money zoos like that inspire people to donate to wildlife/conservation causes, as well as the education potential for children, makes them ultimately good, imo. HOWEVER zoos like the one depicted here have no business existing. They just plain cruel and exist only for entertainment and profit and serve no greater purpose.

The way the Lead and Copper Rule is written, municipal water systems are supposed to test at a representative number of high risk homes to prove their water isn corrosive. So even if you have privately owned plumbing (like a sink faucet) that has a lead component, the water being provided by the utility should not be corrosive to those components. Obviously there can be situations where corrosion control has been optimized but certain scenarios will lead to high lead concentrations. This is why the rule takes into account all samples and not just single hits.

I feel like bounties are being over looked way too much here. The current bounty system already feels super punishing because it nigh impossible to play a clean game in solo queue.

Why is it that when you fully stomping a game, they trying to make it that much easier for it to swing back. you should be allowed to hard stomp if you just that much better and these bounty changes just makes it that much more execution reliant. The bounty system was meant to be a way to prevent the fast, early snowballs which become uncatchable, not just a hard nerf to teams that are smashing.

It needs to, otherwise when adrenaline, for instance, was released, your heart would keep beating at an increased rate forever. The body needs these signals to only act for a while, and to achieve this, it has enzymes to break these hormones and neurotransmitters down. Because of this, dopamine and adrenaline, when injected, only have a half life of a minute or so.There is another, more important, reason why dopamine isn used recreationally (and this goes for using serotonin instead of MDMA too).

He or she will need to assess the current organizational challenges and environmental issues and must possess an incredible balance of police leadership experience, including the ability to communicate effectively; build trustful relationships internally and externally; support people; and have the competence to champion even further change. He or she must also have the ability to hold people accountable   fairly challenging them through due process when they are not, as well as make decisions, which are overall in the best interests of the communities being policed, closely followed by the needs of the members. Saying "yes" to everyone in every situation is not an option.

My friend tried to help the situation by informing the teacher that Frankenstein was the scientist, she then corrected herself whilst looking straight at me and said "Well I mean you look like the monster" these two lines have stuck with me for as long as I can remember.

If atomic decay were happening at 1000x the speed it happens today, it also going to be producing 1000x the heat.And that amount of heat would cook the Earth.Cepitore  4 points  submitted 9 days agoHow much extra heat would be produced if the decay rate was going at an increased rate for roughly 6 months? Also consider that the objective of the flood was to destroy the planet, so there would be a certain level of catastrophic heat that would still fit the narrative.This is all hypothetical, so if we are assuming there is something wrong with radiometric dating data, we couldn't even be sure that pressure was the sole cause of inflated dating calculations so we can't just chalk it all up as 100% due to increased decay rate.My point is, under these hypothetical assumptions, we don't know how much of the misinterpreted data is due to inconsistent decay, and therefore it's tough to guess how much heat the process produced.The main question is still, can pressure possibly alter decay rate? If yes, how much does it take, and if no, why?We just had a treatment on /r/debateevolution that attempted to put a number on this: they took the current heat gradient due to isotopic decay heat, and rolled it backwards to produce the numbers for a 6000 year old Earth assuming we got the decay rates wrong.This isn quite the scenario you asked about, but it fairly similar: instead of a one off event, it a constant rate change, so your scenario would produce a far higher peak temperature; it would still release the same amount of energy over time, so your 6 month scenario would be several thousand times hotter than this.Anyway, 1km underground would be 10x as hot as the sun, which I suggest is probably wrong. According to these numbers, the Earth would still be hot today, as there no other way to get rid of the heat other than radiating it into space.So, I don think this suggestion works.Dzugavili  5 points  submitted 2 days agoEvery such test is embarrassing because all the molecular clock tests of living fossils so far have shown the MRCA is youthful, not hundreds of millions of years old.Because 2 to the 50th power is one quadrillion, the MRCA for any individual species is youthful by mathematics: there only so many generations before the naive ancestor count exceeds the population, and so we are going to start seeing some convergence.
