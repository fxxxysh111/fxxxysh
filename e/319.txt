And please, don even start with the apologia about how capital gains are low because the money was taxed The principal was already taxed. The gains, which eventually dwarf the principal when you wealthy and can afford to leave large sums of money tied up in the stock market to appreciate and earn dividends for years or decades on end, are only ever taxed at a lower rate.

Oh, that right, because if ordinary people paid as little in taxes as the ultra rich and corporations the whole system would collapse.

Well, I have been told I come off as ditzy or spacey (meh, I probably am a bit).

She mentioned that this is a common thing in women and that if I work on that I might be taken more seriously.

If a patient goes to an ER in the middle of nowhere with an ectopic pregnancy, the ethical obligation of the OBG would be to terminate the pregnancy regardless of whether or not the OBG "believes" in terminations (either medical or surgical). 3 points  submitted 13 days ago

Start your game plan. The most important thing is to make your spouse feel needed. Prepare for a night of visual treat. Do not use a lot of words. Men are more visual, so talking to them will not be as effective as showing them. Since your twenty years of marriage is enough for you to know your husband well, you will accurately know what makes him happy. Just be careful not to overdo it and become overly affectionate.

Giants win 3 2 Saturday: That was a nice comeback win! It looked like Jeff Kent would ruin the evening when he hit a home run off Tyler Walker to start the 10th. But in the bottom of the 10th, Dave Roberts doubled and Randy Winn singled to start the inning. Emmanuel Burriss drove home Roberts on a high chopper. And with one out and the bases loaded, Aaron Rowand ripped a single to right through the drawn in infield for the win. With the hit, he redeemed himself for striking out in the 8th when the Giants had the bases loaded with two outs, and he had a chance to drive in the go ahead run. It was one of the more exciting games the Giants have played in a long time. Here the video of the homer on the Giants Web site. View it five or six times. It was a thing of beauty. We might not see another Giants home run for another two weeks.

In your example the pot odds are close or bad, so probably a fold as you deduced. The general questions is much more interesting. The way I see it, part of your edge is the ability for you to read hands and calculate pot odds better than your opponents. When you calculate that you have a +EV play (even if it something like getting 4 to 1 with 25% equity and you closing the action) you should take it. You losing EV if you don seems simple, but there are more factors. How tilted are you going to get if you make a correct pot odds call (but still likely to lose the hand) and then lose the pot? What if you are currently up and this would make you down for the session? How important is it to you to book a win on any given session? I would argue that if you can look past all of these factors and still stick to maximizing EV you have an even bigger edge over the people who are concerned about this other stuff.

The situation that resulted in Cuba, of course, with inspired revolution, also points to the fine line the United States occasionally had to walk. The general instability of a number of countries in Latin America was an awkward problem, with several of them having recently gone through revolution, if not then caught in the middle of civil war themselves. Venezuela, Colombia, and Bolivia were all in the midst of political instability, with governments elevated by coup or revolution, and while having no desire to alienate them, for the US to recognize them might give unintended moral aid to the Confederacy.

Before modernity, love generally happened outside of the dyadic and married couple and, more often than not, ended in tragedy for one or both of the lovers (think Romeo and Juliet or the romantic love of knights in shining armor and their Ladies  who were, of course, married to Lords, not the knights). Sometime around the turn of the last century, these feelings of "in love" got organized into the basis of marriage, a marriage that was to begin with a wedding that would be "perfect.".

Russia urges Japan to 'accept the result' of World War II   Russia's foreign minister has called on Tokyo to accept the outcome of the war in order to advance discussions on a peace plan. Russia and Japan have yet to sign a peace treaty since the end of World War II. Sorry for exaggerating. But they do provoke Korea on various issues. Both on large and small scales. Since Japanese politicians trash talk tends to be a great clickbait, Korean newspapers mark every word what Abe or Aso or whoever says about Korea. Also Korean politicians always use Korean Japanese relationship problem to gain popularity, so they constantly make fuss about even to a issue that has been settled long ago. In conclusion politicians are making the biggest problem. They are gaining popularity by making each other look bad.

It reminds me of the challenge to California death penalty. The argument hinged on death being a "cruel and unusual punishment" violating the 8th amendment.

People in this country need to learn that opening yet another generic food service business without any expertise or market research is a retarded idea. All these uncompetitive businesses that refuse to innovate and only manages to stay afloat by paying their employees slave wages need to die. Koreans need to allocate capital to firms that look to compete globally, there are way too many people looking to sqeeze pennies out of this tiny, oversaturated domestic market. Unskilled labour deserve to be unemployed, and any money allocated to them by slaving away at failing cafe 4393764 is wasted. A min wage hike solves all these problems and forces unskilled laborers and complacent union workers to either make themselves competetive or die trying.

A big part of today's e commerce landscape is the affiliate program (also known as associate programs). This area was pioneered by Amazon. Amazon allows anyone to set up a specialty book store. When people buy books from the specialty store, the person who owns the specialty bookstore gets a commission (up to 10 percent of the book's list price) from Amazon. The affiliate program gives Amazon great exposure because it now has over 1,000,000 specialty bookstores all over the Web [ref]. Therefore this model is now copied by thousands of e commerce sites. If you are setting up an e commerce site you will want to consider an affiliate program as one way to get exposure. Link Share is a company that helps e commerce sites set up affiliate programs.

If you needed to know how much gas was left in an early car, you put a stick in your gas tank, and if you wanted to know the temperature, you went to the radiator itself [source: Lamm].

Yeah, it the most generic fantasy setting that I ever seen. Carbon copy of Tolkien with some of that post GoT edge. Any fantasy with elves and dwarves that not part of AD or Tolkien automatically gets a "are you fucking KIDDING ME STOP WITH THIS SHIT" but couple that with the Gary Stu, immortal gorgeous sex god main character, the adolescent male power fantasy run amok main character, and it just absolutely un fucking bearable.

Your arms are connected to your shoulder blades and this overstretches the muscles between the scapulas causing a tug of war between your chest and back where the muscles (trapezius, rhomboids, erectors, levator scapulae) are constantly trying to pull the shoulder blades parallel to the spine once more. So stretching your pecs and taking breaks to rotate and drop your shoulders will take some of that burden off your your shoulders and back. Hard to tell without finding out what kind of pain it is.You can call ahead and ask the front desk who is the most regularly requested therapist.

Animal proteins provide a greater array of amino acids than vegetable proteins, and eating them allows you to achieve the threshold dose of protein that is necessary for optimal muscle development. For example, a review of studies that tested various protein doses in conjunction with resistance training on muscle development found that a minimal dose of 2.38 g/kg/day of protein is the amount that reliably produced the most muscle development. That's 178 grams of protein for a 75 kg person an amount that is reasonably achieved if you eat meat and take a whey protein supplement or BCAA capsules post workout.

Some may wonder why the possibility of a straight with a heart flush isn't an automatic call on the flop. While it's true that the possibility of two hearts hitting the turn and river (often called runner runner) improve your odds slightly, the odds are knocked back down by the fact that if you hit a flush, it may not be the best flush because the A is out and may be in an opponent's hand; or if you improve to two pair, you could be beat by trips. Remember, don't ever let the possibility of runner runner enter into your calculations until the first runner hits.

I love this show! One thing I can help but notice during this episode was in Cyborg flashback, was the explosion.

Much of the history of medicine in our world has been a struggle against the fact that we have no way of knowing what the hell is happening inside the body. Both in general (how organs and body systems work) and in specific (what is wrong with you). A powerful water bender could probably sense the inner workings of a body the same way Toph can sense surroundings via her connection to the ground, making something akin to X ray, MRI, and CT scans available to society which would be a huge benefit without even needing to do any "water healing" at all.

OOP: Betting small is essentially the same thing as checking, which is betting 0% of the pot. It makes a lot of sense to bet small with strong, but vulnerable made hands   like TPTK on a 3 flush board. This is because betting small OOP doesn re open the betting (which is why it more useful OOP), as Villain would be able to put as many chips in as he wants regardless of whether we bet or check. So if you find yourself on a board where you unsure whether to bet a "normal" size or check, consider betting somewhere in between. It serves the same function as a check, while also denying equity and protecting your hand.

The Turn If you think you have the best hand after seeing the Turn card and are first to act, then go ahead and bet. Many players will try to get fancy and attempt to check raise in this position.

My single biggest hesitation around basic income is that the increased financial stability for the masses may encourage more people to reproduce.

The ENS is a part of the autonomic nervous system that is housed in the gut and is responsible for gut motility and other normal gut functions.28 It is a vast network of neurons that are the first points of contact for microbiota in the intestinal lumen and are an important component of the brain gut axis.One of the most common clinical features of depression is dysregulation of the stress response system, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis.29 As was previously noted, in response to psychological, physiological, and pathological challenges, neurons in the hypothalamus are activated and signal the pituitary to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone into the bloodstream, which in turn activates the adrenal gland to release the stress hormone cortisol.

I had a dog that would dig little holes, stick her nose in, and snarf all hard so that dust would blow up in her face. I had another that liked to rub himself all over shrimp, so my dad would always give him a piece of shrimp when he boight it, just to watch him go. 
It all depends on daily pain and the degrees. Mine are 55/50 and doctors usually recommend surgery only if you exceed that range. My daily pain was a burning sensation on my left upper shoulder area and and chores or standing/walking for more than half an hour to an hour was unbearable.
Is he just saying what he knows he should say? Why bother with all of this anyway ? Could he really have remorse? I don't know anymore. It doesn't matter either way I suppose. I just guess I was hoping there was a reason, as crude as that is. I've said it before though because it was all so senseless. To hear him even say he has no idea why is just maddening.

This isn't a government furlough   Your chances of getting paid are about to zero so you need to spend all of your time looking for another job.

Not to mention watching someone die is a traumatic experience, and killing someone yourself is 10x worse, regardless of what they did to "deserve it." That why PTSD is such an issue with soldiers even when they only committed justified killing in a warzone. Lots of keyboard warriors and armchair referees want to pretend like they wouldn be subject to that, even though they never been in a situation more stressful than mom taking the Xbox away.

I started grad school four months after his funeral. I showed up late to classes, slept through lectures and spent my nights playing cash poker games at a local bar aptly named "Bum's Billiards." I moved into a $200 room in a house that I soon learned had rats in the vents. 
Maybe its common to negotiate the bubble. 
The back and forth eventually escalated to media outlets outside of reddit doing articles on it, and finally the public backlash forced the mods of /r/roll20 (who were all company employees) to hand over the sub to the mods of /r/dnd /r/lfgit was one of those "i glad i got to see that unfold in real time" reddit soap operas because it always satisfying to watch control freak douchebags get brutally owned by the general public.

So I walk with a cane and I can't lift much, however when I'm insisting that I CAN do a particularly small thing it really upsets me when people insist on doing it for me anyway. It makes me feel weaker and embarrassed.

I'm considering replacing it, but I'm sort of on a kick right now of reducing my den. I have so much soap that I don't get to enjoy it. 
My state decided that unless a person is a danger to the public, they shouldn receive state funded psychiatric care even if they can care for themselves. I see a lot of homeless people. Sure, few are starving, but that a low bar to set. Many of them aren in touch with reality or just aren emotionally stable enough to care for themselves. I want to see improvement so those people have places to stay out of the cold and rain, clean clothing, mental care, and access to books or something to keep them happy instead of just alive.
Also fun fact that I not sure is true or not but I been hearing since my friends and I listened to this in high school: Apparently the lead singer of this band was the guy that the lead singer of Brand New girlfriend cheated with. So Adam (TBS singer) stole Jesse (Brand New singer) girl and they both hated each other.

Take advantage of your position on the table. When you are the last player on a table, you have the fortunate advantage of observing your competitor and how they act. If the player calls, raises or folds, you can watch them.

Arlene Dickinson and Jim Treliving were impressed and offered $50,000 for a 50% stake. He accepted and the deal is still in due diligence. 
Make stuff until you good at making stuff, and someone will bite. Read widely, both stuff by Straight White Men and other groups, until you understand that there is not a significant difference in the quality of work. (No, cherry picking YA examples if you write SFF doesn count as a rebuttal.) Stop blaming your own inability to make stuff on the idea that agents and publishers are secretly conspiring against straight white guys because a fraction of the industry references ownvoices on MSWL.

Voulant en savoir plus sur cet article, j'appelle tout simplement la Fdration Nationale des Cinmas Franais, o le juriste m'explique que cette ordonnance n'est plus en vigueur depuis 2 ans  Aprs avoir pris contact avec la Prfecture de police de Paris, j'ai la confirmation que cette ordonnance a t abroge par un arrt du 16 novembre 2007 ! Comment se fait il que la journaliste n'est pas pris le temps de rechercher l'ordonnance en question, ni pris le temps de vrifier si cette ordonnance s'applique encore Il est tonnant alors de voir le tumulte autour de cette banale histoire (il suffit de lire les articles de journaux, la reprise par des blogs ainsi que des forums de discussion) qui peut trouver une explication (justifiable ou non, tel n'est pas le problme on peut d'ailleurs douter des diffrents rcits qui sont faits de cette histoire) qui est tout autre que celle relate par des journalistes..

Just like Tonya Harding, Molly Bloom is not exactly role model material. As she freely admits in the film, she took advantage of gambling addicts. But like Harding, her punishment arguably did not fit her crime. And the movie is full of admiration for what she achieved as a woman exhibiting power over powerful men.
I am already weak at home from all these insidious allegations of being hand in hand with the Russians. I would rather respond now in the most powerful way to send everyone a message that the US will not be taken lightly and that, despite Russian presence in Syria, I will take the Syrians on.

"'Baby' is still okay, but 'babe' is a complete no no for us woman. 
The bacterial issue others are bringing up affects which antibiotics your infection will be susceptible to, rather than rates of transmission. Being totally clear, novel bacteria experienced in the hospital still can cause issues on their own, but it rare relative to the mechanical issues mentioned above, and the patients it happens to are also uncommon.. 
I be all for "significantly reducing carrying around guns" and I argue that any kind of gun "ban" is stupid because there no evidence to support it.. 
Studies were excluded if they focused only on the characteristics of gamblers, treatment retention or therapeutic alliance only, or evaluated pharmacological treatments or Parkinson symptoms that arose from pharmacological treatments with no data related to effectiveness of CBT.. 
Many wearers found the shoe to be lightweight and greater for smaller and less weighty runners. However its seems that just as many saw the shoe more as a fashion statement than a shoe they would use for serious training or physical training. MOSER has been around long enough to have seen the original Ramones in a small club in New Jersey, U2 from the fourth row of a theater and Bob Dylan's born again tours.

These days there are all kinds of hydrotherapy treatments you can experience, and you don't need to travel to remote hot springs to get them. Hydrotherapy spa treatments have come a long way. Some treatments work in tandem, like steam baths followed by quick plunges in cold water. This process is repeated and is supposed to help with the body's internal balance. Underwater massage therapy is popular as well. For this process, you relax in a warm tub while water is applied with a hose at various pressures to sore muscles. You can also get a good old fashioned head, neck and scalp massage while soaking in a hot tub. This can be applied along with aromatherapy treatments for maximum relaxation.

F =MA is tossed around so much by Louie, Matt, other proponents but they hardly ever use it correctly. Unlike real sports where force matters, or power if we are being exact, powerlifting doesnt have the same needs and so the time component is not a large factor.

And again, why all of this technology when we can just send out an email? Cities pretty much know where potholes are now anyway, they just don always have the money or the desire to fix them.

He can fold and give up some substantial equity, he can call, which caps his range and puts him in position to get resqueezed, or he can 5 bet, which at this table against that opponent guarantees aces or kings and you can safely fold.. 
One of the things you have to do is consider residents to have the same mental capacity as small children. 
Here how I understand it to be. Often cholesterol is high to try to repair the damage from inflammation in the body. The small dense type of LDL cholesterol gets caught in the tiny tears in the arteries   trying to fix it, but in a constant state of inflammation the cholesterol piles up and blockages occur and increases the inflammation. 
Oh, and assuming that you weren an enterprising time traveler who remembered to bring along essentially infinite money (or got robbed   the streets of Rome were not particularly safe, especially at night), you be stuck in tenement housing. Emperors continually tried to enforce stricter ones, or to prohibit buildings from going over a certain height in an attempt to prevent collapses. Because they were tenements, and essentially cash grabs by wealthy Romans, they were generally built of plywood and were susceptible to collapse and/or fire.

In the full video, Andris finishes with a triangle choke. I think this video is great, because it shows the beauty and advancement of jiu jitsu. You can use a position that appears weak and still end fights with it.

By choosing to include myth 11 in her list, but by admission choosing to not answer the question, either out of cuteness or trying to keep this article non R rated, she in fact, leaves the soft impression that the stereotype maybe true. Find it so funny that Half Asian Half White brahs are quick to shun their Asian genetics and boast about their half White side. I noticed that sometimes assumptions are made about who I would date in terms of racial preference and I wonder if anyone else has similar experiences? So in the case of this stereotype, it really depends on the person..

Why buy a house when housing prices are dropping every month and rent gets cheaper consistently (like in Japan). Why spend your money to buy goods now when the same articles will be slightly cheaper next month etc. Deflation discourages consumption and investment in tangible goods.

"The Accusers" sounded more like a name of a separate tribe than a call sign though I concede that may have been the name of their faction.On a side note, this movie just left me wondering what point it is that Ronan goes from being obedient to maniacal and when Korath switches sides to join Ronan.
