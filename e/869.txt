However, if you weren last to act, depending on how late you are, if it was checked to me I might still check to try to get a check raise in. That being said, I a very greedy player. Even if you were the player immediately following the BB, stabbing once it checked to you would be a totally fine play, as would going for a check raise.If you had a live read that strong then that changes things, but you should always be cautious about the balance between making a strategically sound play and trusting your instincts. 
My advice is simple, if you want to be "pro" just buy the best courses out there. I live a frugal life and in a place where cost of living is low, so short term (next 5 years), I be thrilled with 20k USD per year, long term I want more obviously, but I know that statistically this is an inevitability considering I beat my game of choice at around 19bb/100 and I just started learning PLO with Nandez stuff, so the big time profit will come, just have to keep playing big field tournies and I be binking one one day..

KAJA KALLAS, a former competition lawyer and member of the European Parliament, is just the sort of businesslike politician one expects in Estonia.

It is accountable only to the Army and chief of Army staff, Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. The civilian government of President Asif Ali Zardari and his ministers has zero control over the spies and live in fear of them. It is not a rogue agency; it is a state within the state. The generals who run ISI have worked with the Taliban for more than 15 years. They provide critical sanctuary for its leaders like Haqqani and Mullah Mohammed Omar. Without direct and substantial Pakistani help, the Taliban could not have recovered from its defeat in Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 and become the threat it is today.

The point is that there was more consequences to the suit than simply "negating an NDA that was already recinded". If it had gone forward, it could have led to more NDA being invalidated, so the case not going forward keeps the other NDA as they were (which is a bearing on the other NDAs).

I cannot for the life of me, believe that the Musikfest officials chose such a poor site to get to, or look at, it's ugly down there! Speaking of Musikfest location for concerts, wait to you see it, its a scam on the concert go er of unbelievable proportions! You have the noise of third street and the trains to contend with, and being out in the open surrounded by old ugly brick buildings that will reflect sound waves in every echoing direction. This whole mess will destroy Musikfest. It was better to go to one location and walk to events! Bethlehem has shot itself in the head, what were they thinking?

I understand that. My point is that, even if the black magic coated insulator primary conductor is a superconductor under the condition that it be inside a magnetic field generated by the pulsed coil, the coil is still using power to generate that magnetic field, so counts as a loss of efficiency of the system as a whole. High voltage transmission lines generally have efficiency loss of around 2 4%, and they just a relatively cheap steel and aluminium cable.

EV is the portion of the pot you win on average when you also consider betting and folding. So if you hold the nut flush on the river, even though your equity is 100%, your EV is much more than 100% if you have more money left in your stacks because you will win whatever else your opponent puts in the pot. And if you have a very weak hand, even though your equity might be 5%, your EV might be lower than that or even 0% as whenever your opponent bets, you have to fold, and if your opponent doesn bet and lets you show down, you had the worst hand anyway. EV is the essence of poker.

Klingon Academy is suuuper buggy; iirc they were behind schedule and released it before ironing out some of the kinks. That said, when it not crashing, it some of the best Star Trek I ever seen.

The story is fantastic, and fills in a lot of the gaps between ST5 6, before the Khitomer accords. And the ship combat is really well done, with fully destructible ship models.

To be fair Olleh has actually been a monster this split. last week. Whereas, Olleh has been consistently good. Aphro, on the otherhand, is the play maker and shot caller for CLG.

Nothing the entourage effect is mostly bunk conjecture put forward by a doctor with no experience in molecular biology or research medicine. Its the cannabis equivalent of the Dr who said vaccines cause autism. The minor constituents found in Cannabis are at extremely low concentrations, well below what is needed to have any type of synergism. The minimal differences experienced when high are more accurately attributed to dose and environment. 10% THC indica will have the same experience as a 10% THC sativa, and smoking the same strains in different environments (low stress like your room vs. high stress like outside of school or in public) will have different experiences. I have talked about this at great length in other posts. THC and CBD produced by yeast are identical to that produced in plants, and it would

But vision and flying navigation skills are something that help raptors survive. Digging and eusocial behaviour help naked mole rats survive. Asexual reproduction helps flat worms survive. Intelligence is just one route to survival   it happens to be the one that applies to us (so we think it is special)   but if it were the only route, then all species would have it (because we all evolved and extant species exist). Species wouldn be around and exist if they hadn figured out that supplement their survival   so again be aware of the inherent you doing here, and the anthropcentric bias that represents.

That's like me telling a new driver that they need to drive aggressive sometimes to get where they need to go, but to be careful of cops and cameras. Other times you'll need to drive defensive, but overall learn to be aware of your surroundings with the mirrors, understand the rules of the road, and learn to steer, break, and accelerate properly. You'll drive great!

By exploiting his former ties to Greenpeace, Moore portrays himself as a prodigal son who has seen the error of his ways. Unfortunately, the media   especially conservative media   give him a platform for his views, and often do so without mentioning the fact that he is a paid spokesperson for polluting companies.

Anyone else really paranoid about messing up their $X00 jackets and other expensive gear on trail?

For starters, layoffs happen when companies want to increase their profits. Secondly, there no situation on earth where a bunch of hardworking employees (who have to follow what the publishers say pretty strictly btw) getting laid off is ever a good thing.
Except for its title, the movie Quantum of Solace does not have anything in common with Fleming short story, but it can be interpreted in the way that Bond takes revenge for Vesper betrayal by hunting down anyone he can possibly reach out to of those connected to the Casino Royale plot.

Option c will give you a return in the form of dividends but the overall value of the investment may go down in the short term. Im looking at a 25 yr window so i look at stocks going down as a chance to get more.

I've found Poker Room to be quite excellent (and Java based, useful for OS X users since most of the other sites I've seen require a Windows download), and the level of play won't kill you if you're just starting out. There's always some open tables, and you can always get more play money. I had AskedMeFi recently about any standalone poker games for OS X and was tipped off to pokerroom; it's certainly better than anything I could download (because apparently the AI available on the different Mac games sucks, whereas the real people you play with are much more reasonably irrational).
Getting hit 4 times means that you must restart the game. The path is up and right, using the elevator rocks, then across to the left. 
Omaha is also played at set limit or pot limit (raises can be up to the current size of the pot). Though it is occasionally available, no limit Omaha is rarely played. In this article, limit Omaha will be discussed unless it is stated otherwise. It is strongly recommended that you play only limit Omaha until you have a great deal of experience because pot limit Omaha can be a brutal game for the beginning player and can take a heavy toll on your bankroll. Rarely play pot limit because, like no limit, one mistake can be extremely expensive.

I currently live in Europe and travel frequently. It surprises me how uninterested I am with hooking up. Originally, I set an unofficial goal of hooking up with a guy in ever country I visit (30 in the past 3 years). However it takes so much time to weed through flakes that I constantly reminded I didn come here to chase men. If I meet someone and there a connection, fine.
It similar to radio, the license is not for any individual song. There is actually a niche industry where people will go around and help you claim royalties you may never have known existed. I think it was only a few years ago when the amount of unclaimed royalties in the US was around $400 million, so it unsurprising people are trying to get a piece of the commission for almost little to no work claiming.
If you want a more versatile game variety with up to 10 hands per play, once again I have to recommend RTG's casino software. The platform includes 17 different ways to play, all provided in single hand mode, and many with the option to play 3, 10, 50 or 100 hands per play.

The first one, for instance A K Q J 2 will beat another suit of A K Q 10 9 because you disregard highest ties until you find whose highest untied card is higher. 
There were 20 of us. We all had to pay 100$ to get 1000 chips. We all had a blue chip (Survival chip) which we could use for another 1000 chips. The structure was 30 minutes each round. Starting with 1/2, 2/5, 5/10, 7/15, 10/20, 15/30, 25/50, 50/100 and so on. I lasted till the 50/100 (almost 6 hours including some short breaks). I started slow. I hit 1 8 pair on the flop and 1 10 pair on the turn. The cards open were a 2,7, 8 and 10. I had 8 and 10 in my hand. I played slow. The other guys knew I was new and I had been re raised which led to me folding in the past. This time, I was re raised on the turn and this was the biggest raise so far   200 chips. (Stupid mistake) I re raised him to 500 chips. Little did I know, he instantly called me and he had a straight. I was down to 300 350 odd chips. Then I won a few hands here and there. I thought I played well because I was able to increase the small pots well when I had a stronger hand. I somehow got through 6 rounds (3 hours) and I had 900+ chips. And then it was the last call to use the extra buy in. I was not gonna, but everybody with bigger stacks of 3000 chips also bought. 20 players had gone down to 12. So, I spent 100$ more.
Some card players have got the fatal neurotic trend who bend their cards to damage and finally ruin that unmindfully. These players use to have some exceptional things to resist this like unique products or, some coins. Now, they have changed their product sense as they have included On the Dealer Poker Card Protector replacing the older pieces. 
Kyle Cooper, who created the film's title sequence, compared Sable to Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man. There were thousands upon thousands of pages of this stuff, almost all of which didn't the make the movie, beyond being scattered about in the background of John Doe's apartment. The most screen time this work saw was an eight minute montage pocketed away on the DVD. But when Se7en ran out of money and couldn't shoot the title sequence they originally wanted, Kyle Cooper finally suggested using it.
People have called for it for years. I have mixed feelings about it. I think it provides unfair access and leverage for certain groups and play styles at the expense of all others. 
Pour les soldats de la guerre sainte islamique, le monde est divis en deux parties : il y a les territoires de l'Islam et le reste. Pour ces fous de Dieux, il tait du devoir des musulmans de soumettre et de convertir tous ceux qui ne l'taient pas.

A word of warning: his leaving the church" will be communicated to the church and yield and automatic excommunication. And the Catholic church is relentless and global. Once you opt for this, they will send a message to your birthplace in Italy to record this. Your priest might want to have a word with your mama. People will talk about it. You will never be able to marry in the church or receive the communion anymore. Thus, if the church matters to you, pay the tax. I personally know Spaniards and Polish who had a nasty surprise when they tried to get married in church. The family and brides were not pleased as the Polish even needed to cancel the whole wedding to sort things out first.

Let's say you get a dent in the hood   nothing too drastic, just a shallow, even dent with no sharp creases in an area that's pretty easy to reach. You think it'll be easy to pop it out on your own, so you begin to massage the underside while holding your shaping tool in place. You've made good progress so far, and a casual observer wouldn't even notice the flawed area. But it's not exactly perfect, and since it's been fairly easy to this point, you decide to keep massaging the area to make it flawless. After a few more minutes of massaging, you realize that you've pushed it just a little too far. And now you've got this flabby area on the hood where you stretched out the metal. And there's no easy way to shrink it back down. Keep going and it'll stretch even more. Lesson learned. And it's a pain in the butt. And it's expensive. And I've also made some bad calls in terms of judging what I can handle myself . and what I'd just make worse. That said, I've never bought a product from an infomercial to attempt a car repair.

Just this basic understanding annihilates Schofield argument that books should not only spark joy but challenge and perturb us.

Now you must decide how many unseen cards can help you win. These cards are called your "outs," and this terminology will be used from here on. (One question that is often asked is: "The other players have cards in their hands that cannot come to me on the turn or the river, so how can I count them in the cards that will improve my hand?" The answer is: You must count all cards that can help you because you have no way of knowing what cards are in your opponents' hands, even if it is quite likely that they hold certain cards. Therefore, all unseen cards need to be counted.)

Every other major industrialized economy already has a Value Added Tax so it should not be a major issue. The VAT that I proposing is lower than that of most other major economies   half the average European level for example.

We would see an explosion of entrepreneurship on a scale that we have never seen.

The Athanasian Creed is usually divided into two sections: lines 1 28 addressing the doctrine of the Trinity, and lines 29 44 addressing the doctrine of Christology. Thus, each person of the Trinity is described as uncreated (increatus), limitless (Immensus), eternal (ternus), and omnipotent (omnipotens). While ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the Trinity, thus avoiding subordinationism, the first half of the Athanasian Creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one Godhead, thus avoiding a theology of tritheism. Furthermore, although one God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from each other. For the Father is neither made nor begotten; the Son is not made but is begotten from the Father; the Holy Spirit is neither made nor begotten but proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque).

Then, in a surprisingly clever move, they get DIVORCED.

There are several ways to deal with conspiracy theories and urban legends. You can give them a long look, shrug, and move about your day.

These absurd tales soak up a ton of mankind's collective brain space, and though they admittedly focus on the part that's not too likely to find the cure for cancer, I'd argue they should totally be forced to earn their keep . by entertaining us. As I've mentioned before, a lot of these batshit crazy theories would make kickass movies, and I'm actually kind of pissed they're so rarely adapted to the silver screen.

Winstar hotel is kinda pricey. But once you have had a poker session be sure to ask the hotel front desk if they can comp you a room. Winstar will give you 2 free rooms every 2 weeks on non premium days. You need a players card and im not 100% they will give it to new card members but worth a shot. There is 2 or 3 other hotels right next to winstar that are slightly more reasonably priced. Other than those. You would have to uber/drive 10 mins south for the cheapest of rooms.

One of the Texas Hold Em strategies that you should always practice whenever you play is for you to have enough discipline. No matter how skilful you are, if you lack discipline, then, you might as well say goodbye to the thought that you can win at Holdem. For instance, when all the signals tell you not to tilt, but you still tilt, then, that means that you have to improve on your discipline.

We see that old works that portrayed consciousness and divinity in a manner which resonates with the Cosmically Conscious were typically hidden subversively in religious art commissions. For example, take the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo had to hide hidden meaning into a painting that glorified the Vatican stupid and simplistic vision of deity and divinity. I am a huge fan of HBO TV series Westworld which carries storylines that I believe are analogous to consciousness, divinity, and human ascension. In this article, The Verve talks about the appearance of Michelangelo hidden meanings and how they showed up in this TV show about consciousness. It not related to the painting you posted, but it an interesting read.
