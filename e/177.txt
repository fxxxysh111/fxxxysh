The district court found that the editing had indeed impaired the integrity of the work, and had caused irreparable damage. That is, some of the people who had seen their mutilated work would not watch further episodes and would not become Monty Python fans. On the other hand, the judge found that if ABC were to withdraw the second special from their program a few days before the date that had been announced in TV schedules, ABC would also suffer damage

Seriously, I'd be worried not only about the potential fire but the utter insanity of trying to explain to the fire department that the blaze started while she was cooking some sausage and the balls on the side of the pan burst into flames. They're going to assume she's Jeffrey Dahmer before she goes on to explain that they were just crocheted testes and there's nothing weird happening in their house at all.
I consider myself a Motown enthusiast, but the label was more about big (or minor, they not that picky) chart toppers than cohesive albums   at least pre Marvin Gaye/Stevie Wonder magic. This album gimmick is to collect a bunch of the aforementioned chart toppers, performed by Motown most precious act, nay sensation of the time. So, these songs are immediately familiar, but selecting the right artists to record these songs (instead of just mindlessly handing them all to that one super successful vocal group) to turn them into the cultural tour de force they were really was Motown big achievement. The auxiliary renditions on "A Go Go" are merely pleasant diversion for both the Supremes and the listener.

German luxury cars are famous for their over the top technology, and the E43 is no exception. The interior is dominated by a pair of wide screen displays with sharp graphics and a dizzying assortment of features. None of them, however, are as impressive as the available semi autonomous systems. Drive Pilot allows the driver to let go of the steering wheel on the highway for up to 60 seconds while maintaining the appropriate speed, staying in the lanes, and even performing a lane change when the turn signal is activated. There's a definite learning curve to the features and controls, but once that threshold is passed, it's hard not to be amazed.

RPW does not endorse a moral stance. We discuss the elements of girl game not as behaviors that are right, or good, or morally superior, but as tactical behaviors that work to help us achieve our goals. We come from all different walks of life, so on RPW you will find harmonious and productive discussions between very religious traditional conservative women and hardcore BDSM submissives and everyone in between. What we all share is not a lifestyle, a set of values, or a worldview, but a way of relating to men.

Even if you were on an extended coffee break sitting out, you will know from those numbers you are dealing with a maniac.

Searching for and finding an ambassador (or an interior or finance minister) that will protect the interests of the president is simply an organic outcome of operating under the shadow of Pakistan's mutilated Constitution. For the president, Haqqani's freelancing modus operandi is not a drawback, but rather a strength. His job, as a function of being a presidential appointee (from a country where the president is supposed to be symbolic) is to protect the very power that enabled his appointment in the first place..

Wenn wir diese oder jene Arzneimittel zur Heilung unserer Krankheiten einnehmen, machen wir uns recht selten Gedanken darber, woraus sie bestehen, was sie enthalten, wie sie hergestellt werden. Die pharmazeutische Industrie ist ein riesiges, auf Umsatz ausgerichtetes Geschft. Ihre gesamte Ttigkeit ist auf die Entwicklung neuer Medikamente ausgerichtet (und demzufolge auf immer grere Gewinne), als auf die Heilung von Menschen. Das Ergebnis ist, dass moderne Arzneimittel immer komplexer werden, sowohl in ihrer Zusammensetzung, als auch in ihrer Wirkung. Das Problem besteht darin, dass nicht nur Symptome verschwinden", sondern auch zahlreiche Kontraindikationen und Nebenwirkungen existieren. Je komplexer ein Prparat ist, desto komplexer sind auch die Wirkungen auf den Organismus.

But the clash of cultures   theirs and ours   is a teachable moment for me. No matter how complex our awareness of gender, race, and national identity is, the killing of women for being disobedient is always wrong. And no matter how much we might allow that many women under consumer capitalism choose to wear bikinis and many Muslim women choose to wear hijab, there are severe limits to notions of choice within conditions of structural inequities. In other words, part of the argument of "diversity" is accepting the rather liberal notion that we are free agents making free choices of our own free will. But of course none of this is free.

The specific dynamics of the set are definitely worth exploring.

But for one to insist that what Islam "honest[ly]" and fully says about homosexuality aims to undermines things like: support for LGBT by ISNA (the biggest Western Muslim organization), the reconciled experiences of actual LGBT Muslims, and a subcultural history in Islamic civilizations which involve positive integration of homosexual and trans peoples.

The rising cost of healthcare has even previously led some public figures, like philosopher Daniel Callahan[2]and Colorado Governor Lamm,[3] to advocate healthcare rationing against older patients. In the US, healthcare costs have risen from 5% of the GDP in 1960 to 17.4% in 2013.[4] Costs have grown because of the discovery of better diagnostic tools to prevent illnesses, the treatment of hitherto untreatable diseases, and the prevention of unexpected death by CPR. These technologies improved quality of life and increased life expectancy from 47.3 years in 1900 to 78.7 years in 2010.[5]They have benefited every age group, yet it is the "elderly" alone who have been made the targets of calls for healthcare rationing in order to curb these costs.

I had met and interviewed Benazir on several occasions, including in 1989 in Karachi in Bilawal House, where husband Asif, wearing jodhpurs, marched right through our conversation as if demonstrating who really was boss in that household. As AP correspondent and for a long spell the only American journalist in Pakistan, I had a relationship with Bhutto that verged occasionally on intimacy, as the time he invited me into his guest bedroom in the Peshawar home of the chief minister of the northwest frontier province, the Muslim religious leader, Mufti Mahmud.
Sustainability in ingredients is a huge passion for me, so personally for my botanical brand, I only use sustainably sourced ingredients, many of them wild harvested in ethical amounts from naturally occurring ecosystems. For this same reason I refuse to use animal products in my goods (save for ethically sourced Honey absolute) as it's inhumane, gross, or unsustainable (mainly thinking of animal musks here). I also make my own tinctures for base oils for my blends, which someone mentioned isn't that common for brands.

As a beginner, you may want to show your hand all the time, since you may have overlooked a winning hand. What you gain from one such pot will far outweigh any loss due to revealing how you played a particular losing hand. "Cards speak" at the showdown, meaning that you need not declare the value of your hand.

D) I could care less about the belief system of past, present or future scientists as long as they of course practice the scientific method correctly, first and foremost. However I would be far more inclined to accept any further theoretical thinking that wasn necessarily based on empirical evidence from an Atheist scientist, than I would a modern Christian one.

So when the Cold War ended in the US, we Americans rewrote our foreign policy narratives to turn the bad guys, the Soviets, into good guys, the newly "democratic" Russians. Russians, meanwhile, continued to have very complicated feelings toward the US. ordinary Russians as well as policy makers, the US was powerful and therefore had to be taken into account. the US was also still seen as imperialistic (although primarily cultural imperialism after the Soviet Union), too simplistic, and far too arrogant.

These could be chalked up to differences in taste, as Hamilton was obsessed with aristocracy and nobility, probably consuming the writing of effete dandies and believing that if he could write like they do, he could become one of them (which worked!).
When I was about 8 years old I was at a friend house playing video games and such. After a couple of hours it time to go home, but I can seem to find my phone. I look for it in the pockets of my jacket, on his bed (where I took off my jacket) and other places in his room.

I been thinking the same thing the last couple of days. I have winter tires and have driven in Edmonton most of my life. This year is bad. Since Friday, I driven from downtown to Mcconachie and westend to south Edmonton commons so kind of all over the city. If you on the Whitemud or the Henday it pretty good (down to bare pavement) but as soon as you off, there are many icy patches all over the city. I not talking residential roads either but main thoroughfares. Not sure what the solution is besides sand, sand, sand. no one won or lost chips because of it) but it was definitely weird and wrong and I never seen anything like it before/after. Late in a satellite, first hand after a break and one player hadn made it back to his seat yet so his hand was mucked which is standard. After this happens it is realized that a misdeal has occurred. (can remember why). Floor comes over and agrees with dealer, misdeal. No big deal. Then the floor (who had been standing near the table before the misdeal) also rules that the player who wasn at the table would now have to miss this hand as well because " he wouldn have been here for the first hand if there was no misdeal", despite him now being in his seat.

Thinking about the future is ultimately a fruitless idea as there are too many variables that go into it. If you wanted to think about what you are going to do in university you'd have to know every single thing you are going to do up to university and that's simply impossible, I'm not saying it's a stupid thing to do, it can be fun to make up scenarios about what we are going to do with ourselves, but try not to worry about it, move into the future with a healthy dose of caution and try to learn from the mistakes you make and that's all anyone can ask you to do. If the stress gets to much to handle on your own try to find someone you trust and talk to them about it, and ultimately just try to respect who you are and how you treat yourself
Speaking for myself, not South Koreans specifically, I more worried by the superpowers of China and the US. North Korea is just a small poor country that trapped in a virtually closed system. With some very notable historic exceptions, North Korea is more a threat to North Koreans than to any of the rest of us, and the outside world seems content to just shut the lid and allow the abysmal conditions in North Korea to continue.

I would say that the Trine soundtracks exist in a weird place for me, where a lot of the individual themes and melodies kind of blend together into a mushy, mostly unrecognizable amalgam that just says "Trine", rather than any individual concepts or ideas contained within. However, hearing the revisited version of Astral Academy and the Academy Hallways here in Trine 3 soundtrack is a really nice callback that illustrates to me how the themes are just lying there beneath the surface, waiting to be recalled.
Eventually, Shackleford said, if players stay true to a perfect strategy one designed to maximize their performance over the long haul, such as by getting rid of potentially decent cards like low pairs to increase chances of a big payout royal flush their luck will turn, based on statistics, and they break even or come close to it.

The game is Texas Hold 'Em No Limit poker, and films such as Rounders, the 1998 Matt Damon drama, along with Moneymaker and the explosion in online gaming, are credited with bringing it into the mainstream and out of the smoke filled back rooms of gangsterdom and the gambling demi monde. It is now perfectly respectable to be a professional poker player and perhaps 20% of the 427 entries at Aspers for the guaranteed 400,000 guaranteed prize pool on the weekend I was there would earn a living that way. The rest, myself included, were a mixture of recreational and online players   the "dead money" to the pros   but the beauty of tournament poker is that there is always a chance that, with a steady nerve and a run of luck, you can stay in long enough to take home a pay out.

TRADE SECRET is the suggestion; Eight Hours and Swilly Ferry complete the required short list.The last five winners have all been returned in single figures so it's well worth paying attention to the market. Bill Turner has done exceptionally well with his early juveniles and has landed this race twice in the last three years so Could It Be Magic figures prominently.Swilly Ferry is from a yard that has been going strongly in recent weeks so is another to bear in mind along with Eight Hours who is the representative from the yard that took this prize two years back and he has a speedy pedigree.Mel Brittain's runners have finished third and sixth in the last two runnings so he knows what's required to hit the target and he's double handed with Trade Secret and Heslington. The latter is related to a juvenile winner and partnered by a jockey that rides regularly for the yard but Alan Munro has ridden winners for Mel Brittain and his colt is by Tweenhills new stallion Trade Fair who was a high class two year old. His draw in fifteen should give his pilot some options so we'll take a chance with Trade Secret.
Pick a game. There are dozens of different video poker games in casinos. Different games will have different rate of returns, meaning some games, if you win, will give you a higher percentage of your money back and others will give you a lower percentage. A "9/6 Jacks or Better" paytable is the best because the rate of return is 99.54%, meaning the casino only keeps .46% of your money.[1]

The most important thing with bet sizing is to consider how villain possible holdings might react to different sizings. You can say to yourself "if he has a flush draw then I want to bet X % of pot because, if he has two pair then I would want to be betting X % of pot" etc. and then pot size or even double pot if you have the nuts and think opponent has something he would consider calling with. i get it.

Damnit feel old for saying this but it was when I worked at Blockbuster 16 years ago, we got a new shipment of movies and Berserk happened to be in there. For the most part, I ignored the series long enough but then I noticed a lot of customers renting the series, not just nerds and geeks but all walks of people renting that series. It wasn until a kid from my school who would be the equivalent of the highschool king rented the series, came back to my store and talked my ear off about the series for like almost an hour. Afterwards, that night, I checkout all the DVDs and went to my friend house to watch them. Needless to say, we watched the entire series in one sitting and we were hooked from there. Unfortunately, like everyone else at time, we didn persue the series after the abrubt ending until like 8 years later when we discovered thru the marvelous wonders of the internet that there was books on the series. Needless to say again, on my days off, I read thru the whole entire manga in two days of sitting :)

The Scientific Method and TruthNothing is ever proven to be absolutely true in science and, together with the use of the word theory, even on something like the Theory of Gravity, which almost anyone would consider a truth, this leads many people to think science isn't the answer. This then annoys scientists who tend to forget that although a scientific theory works for all practical and theoretical purposes, and we're 99.99% sure it is correct, it can never be proven 100%.

The reputation of Las Vegas may be responsible for the popular conception that it has a substantial population of prostitutes. Additionally, it may be commonly assumed that the workers at a Las Vegas escort service will offer sexual services, even if that worker does not in fact offer them.

If the media doesn do its job and recognize a white revolution when it gathers in large numbers on their doorstep, then they will have the blood of patriots on their hands. Not the crazy white people running around screaming that Obama is Hitler, but the blood of real Americans who do not think that "guns and God" made this country great, but diversity and respect and a willingness to take care of one another when times are tough. It is surely these Americans who will suffer the consequences of the highly armed wrath of the White Revolution.

Last year, Americans spent more than $80 billion playing state lotteries, that's around $250 for each citizen, more than what was spent on concerts, sporting events and movie tickets combined. Over 25 states took in more from their lottery proceeds than from corporate income tax. Because of these stakes, it's essential that, in both perception and reality, lotteries are truly games of chance, everyone entering with an equal opportunity to win.

But for those who want to keep the space in their backseats and trunks for groceries and suitcases instead of filling it with monolithic speakers, there are more luxurious options. Audi, for instance, offers a Bose surround sound system with 14 speakers, including a subwoofer. There's even a microphone that picks up on the noise level in the car so that it can automatically adjust the volume louder to compensate for background noise [source: Audi]. And, not to be outdone, Lincoln even started incorporating THX certified (basically, movie theater quality) audio systems in their luxury cars [source: CNet].

I definitely would not mind going over there, for sure. Patriots lacked a game changing receiver weapon after Josh Gordon was suspended, yet that didn seem to matter in the playoffs. Other free agent wide receivers include Demaryius Thomas, Adam Humphries, Cole Beasley and Randall Cobb, though Antonio Brown will be the most attractive on the market (through a trade).

At the highest level of aggregation, this methodology also provides information about the total welfare value of PSB, which may be compared to the subsidies given. For the Netherlands, and based on the conservative assumptions made here, there seems to be a positive return on investment: in 2011, PSB organizations received 798 million in subsidies, used not only for television but also for radio and internet activities (Tweede Kamer,2011 2012TweedeKamer. (2011 2012). 33 000 VIII:Vaststelling van de begrotingsstaten van het Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap(VIII)voor het jaar 2012, Nr. 59. Brief van de minister van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap.[Google Scholar]). This is substantially less than the estimated minimum welfare value of at least 927 million for television alone. From a welfare economic perspective, however, this positive rate of return is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for public funding: without such funding, commercial channels create consumer surplus as well as profits. To give a satisfactory justification for public funding, the resolution of market failure by PSB needs to be shown convincingly. The observation that PSB programs receive significantly higher quality scores after correcting for program characteristics is a promising starting point for that. Further analysis of spill over effects, for which catch up TV and perhaps website visits are a proxy, is another.

So I pay for internet only. Instead of the supposed 60 mbps down speed I should be getting, I get just a little less than 30 in normal circumstances. And when someone in the house is streaming in HD, I drop under 15. And very randomly at times, I could even drop below 1, practically unusable. This actually happened two days ago and lasted for over 6 hours. Friends told me they also felt the throttled speeds too, so it wasn on my end.

UPDATE: The race organizers sent out an email, basically blaming the City of Malden and Dept of Recreation, who they said were supposed to negotiate the permit. They said DCR denied it for "Reasons that are still unclear". So the "solution" they offering is for the half marathon and 5 mile to run the same course, but the 5 mile start an hour and a half later to give the half marathoners time to complete (half due to start at 7AM; there will be slower runners still on the course at that time, including myself).

He did a great job last year for us, and I don blame him for wanting to cash in one last time. Hopefully the Eagles can trade him but they got such a huge return for value last year for what little they gave up for him that even if they have to release him, picking him up was still a great move. 16 points  submitted 6 days ago

The Athanasian Creed is usually divided into two sections: lines 1 28 addressing the doctrine of the Trinity, and lines 29 44 addressing the doctrine of Christology. Thus, each person of the Trinity is described as uncreated (increatus), limitless (Immensus), eternal (ternus), and omnipotent (omnipotens). While ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the Trinity, thus avoiding subordinationism, the first half of the Athanasian Creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one Godhead, thus avoiding a theology of tritheism.

Every business has the right to refuse a customer but this just feels like a gimmick that overall detracts from the experience.
So they called us in a little while later and showed us the images of the scans and discussed every minor detail with us. I must say, if we had any doubts about their competence before we left home, the doubts have been completely replaced with confidence.

6 months later I go for my annual eye exam to update my contact prescription. Two minutes in, the doctor says I have amblyopia in my right eye caused by my prior ptosis. It turns out I'm incredibly lucky that it's so mild (20/25 is rare with the severity of ptosis I had and how long it took to get it fixed), but my eyebrow muscles were compensating and lifting my lid enough to prevent major damage. 
I was friends with a guy from work that I kind of liked. After we hung out with some other friends, he walked me to my car. I had to leave to get home for curfew. He leaned on the car door and wouldn let me leave and told me I was lying about having a curfew. I was really creeped out. He kept wanting me to kiss him while he basically wouldn let me get in my car. I told him we shouldn because if we weren sure we are going to date, it would make our friendship weird. Later he told me I was right about not kissing because I wasn emotionally mature enough to handle a relationship.

"One of the reasons I wanted to do an anthology format is I like stories with endings. I like a good third act. And continuing serial dramas, they tend to have really good beginnings and really long middles and then sort of have to hustle to develop an ending. 
So I definitely think I butchered this hand. Looking back, his pre flop play left him uncapped, so there's no reason for me to not fear AK, AQ, or AA on this board. In fact, his lead on the turn probably discounts hands like JJ/TT, as the A didn't scare him off of those. 
In truth we have forsaken the right to call Iqbal our national poet. What commonality is there between his poetry and our way of life? The way our leaders conduct themselves   fawning when they should know better not to, listening to lectures when they should have the wit and understanding to educate foreigners about the reality of Pakistan and its neighbourhood   shows no sympathy or connection with Iqbal. There should be no commemoration of Iqbal Day and no changing of the guard at his tomb   betwixt Lahore's great mosque and the imposing faade of Akbar's fort   until we learn to conduct ourselves with greater national dignity.

Also men smoke disproportionately more than women in korea (supposedly this is because young women see what chain smoking old ladies look like and get scared, go figure) so smoking has a cool, masculine image associated with it. 
Now this was funny as well a very serious charge. We had no access to check this out from Big Khan as he had stopped coming to Parliament. Sheikh Aftab had a point when he asked why did the PTI take oath if the elections were rigged. More important, why did they question the PML (N) mandate after a year and not earlier. Well, we too fail to understand why can't the PTI tell us its demands about electoral reforms. We can understand if Imran is keeping his political strategy close to his chest but why not share his electoral demands.
