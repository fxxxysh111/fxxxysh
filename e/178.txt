Want to know why humans are greedy bastards who live outside the means of our environments? It's not like humans are stupid as has been suggested; simply, cultures and groups of people throughout history who espoused living in balance and harmony with their environments were conquered and pushed out or killed by other humans expanding their reach for resources. What was always the argument? "Those Sioux want Dakota territory as their great reservation? There's only like 15,000 of them, the land is sitting empty and they're not using it.

An "ace" is a fighter pilot who shoots down 5 enemy aircraft during aerial combat. Each country had a slightly different set of rules for claiming an enemy aircraft "kill". For example, the rule may require that another pilot or person on the ground witness the event. commands also credited aircraft destroyed on the ground as equal to aerial victories. Soviets distinguished between solo and group kills, as did the Japanese. The Allies (US) began to mount gun cameras on the aircraft that could help confirm an enemy aircraft shot down. Of course, if the enemy a/c dove out of the camera range before exploding then it was still in doubt. During World War 1, the "Blue Max" was awarded to German pilots upon downing 8 enemy aircraft. That number was later raised, so that a pilot became an "ace" first and then later received the Blue Max. Also in World War 1, some pilots would fly solo sorties. So, to ensure they would get credit for an enemy aircraft, sometimes they landed and cut the tail number off of the downed aircraft in order to validate their claim. Appendix German "aces" were called "experts" or Experten. Only single air victories were attributed (and only if somebody else could affirm it). This is a "by the way." remark. E.

Next, we must determine whether Gaetz had the requisite intent. I noticed many commenters on this issue say that there is no direct evidence of intent, and that it is difficult to prove intent. This is not so. Intent is commonly proven through circumstantial evidence. After all, you can read minds or exactly document what a person is thinking at the time they commit a crime. If direct evidence was required to prove intent, no one would ever be convicted of 1st degree murder. Moreover, with regard to witness intimidation, a defendant subjective intent is not relevant. Manchester v. 54, 70 (D. Mass. 2015) [citing Commonwealth v. 2010)]. Therefore, Gaetz deletion of his tweet and recent statements that he did not intend to stop Cohen from testifying are irrelevant. Intent to "influence, delay, or prevent" testimony may be found by proving a "reasonable likelihood" that absent the defendant actions, the witness would have communicated with federal officers. Lobbins v. United States, 900 F.3d 799, 802 (6th Cir. 2018) [citing Fowler v. 668, 672 (2011)]. However, it is not required that the threat actually prevent the witness from testifying. v. Murray 751 F.2d 1528, 1534 (9th Cir. v. Willard, 230 F.3d 1093, 1095 (9th Cir. 1985) (holding that the proper focus is on the defendant endeavor, not whether his actions actually prevented a witness from testifying). Here, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that Gaetz intended to influence or prevent testimony:

In the Areopagitica John Milton reaches into the heavens to condemn the destroyer of all books, finding them soulless monsters who would destroy Reason itself. Well, there are monsters like this that may be demons, and monsters that may be anointed avengers, tunneling Milton or not.

To add to the drama, Leffen (a very popular outspoken player who was once banned from competing for a year due to toxic behavior) dislikes Hungrybox for personal reasons and made a video about "reasons why you should hate Hungrybox", which added fuel to the fire. Note that many of these reasons were strictly personal drama type things and not complaints about his actual gameplay.
 1,173 points  submitted 27 days agoA beguiling photograph taken by Irving Penn in 1947 shows an indomitable one legged man, bearded and cloaked in bearskin, and a mysterious woman perched in his shadow. The towering Viking is Peter Freuchen, and the woman at his side is his third wife, Dagmar Cohn. Standing at a formidable six feet seven inches, Peter Freuchen's size befitted a man who was larger than life in more ways than one.The "11%" CPU background usage can be explained by programs you have open, some normal Windows background processes, etc. And might even be gone entirely should you run the benchmark again.In short, it not concerning in the slightest.As for the XMP profile for the RAM : your RAM kit has been tested to be stable at the advertised frequency, and your motherboard supports that frequency. The biggest risk you take by enabling the XMP profile is to run into instability issues (like Blue Screens).That should be exceedingly rare though, and would be easily reversible. Though if you can afford to have a single unforeseen crash because you doing renders that take hours/days, keeping everything at stock is far from absurd.
Features of Lawn TennisIt is particularly easy to identify the main features of tennis, because it is so well known across the world. The court is 23.8m (78ft) long and 11m (36ft) wide. The service boxes are 6.4m (21ft) from the net, and a single service box is 4.1m (13ft 6in) wide.

She can a job and get her own place, or get on disability if she can work, or get government assistance like welfare and food stamps to get by, or be placed in assisted living with you guys paying for it if you must, but there no reason you have to live this way.

9A 91 is one of the Night Royalty units. Her skill gives her incredible damage during night time, which is only useful if she actually hitting things. Make sure she has PEQs on if she going in at night. Aside from that note, you can just place her like any other ARSMG+HG echelon.

I think everyone skepticism is reflective of the whole STEM is king circlejerk and the general neglect of our use of / trust in scent. Disease wasn detected by proper testing procedures, just this lady nose? Bullshit! I think scent is one of those highly complex things that we haven quite learned to harness in cases like this. Diseases are changing the chemistry of a person, and it isn that hard to believe that certain altered chemical processes might end up producing some compounds that have a unique scent.

If he has engaged in this chat then just sit with him when he plays, tell him how much it interests you and that you want to watch and learn. He won't be doing it in front of you I'm guessing but if he does then kick him out he's not worth it, and if someone starts that kind of chat with him whilst you are there with him then confront him about it, not in a angry way to start conflict but certainly not in a shy way either, be stern in what you want and make sure he understands that you will not tolerate this behaviour. If all else fails maybe go for the whole if you can't beat them join them thing and see how he likes it.

So we slept in treehouses! Our tree house even had a bathroom. There was a beach nearby and a bar with a firepit in the middle, and it was fun, except that there were only other travelers there and we enjoy hanging out with the Turks, so we left after two days and drove to Kas, a beach town about two hours west of there..

PD results from the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. This results in poor muscle control, among other symptoms.CBD acts as an inverse agonist at the GPR6 protein receptors of the brain, which boosts dopamine levels since a depletion of GPR6 is correlated with this effect in ways we don fully understand as of yet.So no, the CBD oil is not slowing down his brain function that precisely the issue with PD.

Some of the articles were on significant works by John Locke and Antoine van Leeuwenhoek, but many and probably most were on obscure topics in nitty theological history and mostly invisible philosophical issues, or at at least that is how the latter seems to me today. The Bibliotheque brought new ideas to the continent, and brought them in the Lingua Franca, which also happened to be French.. 
Saying "fuck it we can all just die" when faced with being left out of the decision making process (for good reason, like facts) isn really being duped. There are other species where you can see a rather large subset seem to almost intentionally harm or negate progress for the whole. Humans aren really special in this aspect it would appear..

No matter what the sub says, I think this roster really has potential, especially with the subs. I think a full on vacation (and a business class flight!) are in order for all our boys in blue   including you, Jack (and hey, you don have to retire). We have all this time to regroup and come into the Spring split in an even better form than was shown in the quarterfinals.

Of course not every athlete brings them the same revenue but if this was announced on women day, it would mean(to me at least) that they are looking at it like a marketing strategy. It makes them seem more attractive to female athletes and gives them good public PR.

It isn as though color printing was new in the publishing industry, as books had been printed in different colors besides black for at least 300 years by this time; even full color printing had been around for 120+ years, so it isn as though they were experimenting with the color equivalent of newly available typefaces in a 1985 word program. Color photography in books is brand new at this point, the wide scale use taking place this year, but these images are not photos, so I doubt that this had much of an effect on the creativity of the designer. Was very adventurously used int he early sci fi pulps and monthlies, but that stuff was already being employed for two decades by this point so their newness in regard to publishing experimentation is not an issue. 
Most smokers reach a point where they wished they never started. Studies show that the younger people start the more likely they are to get addicted.

Cannot even do it at a state level right now because the Obama administration not only shut down single payer as an option at the national level, but insisted that states not be allowed to implement their own single payer systems until well after the patchwork, half assed system of national healthcare reform gets put into place. Must fight for their rights to have single payer and opt out of the national Frankenstein monster of insurance coverage we being offered. 
The Last Tiger for example still shows signs of this. You play as the Germans, so there still reminders that over all, Germany were the bad guys in the war. They both wanted and needed to avoid making them look like the good guys. Individuals or crews, like your crew in the war story, were fine, but not the Germans as a wholem.
(Don do any problem solving field in general.) However if you are okay with the struggle you should be fine. 
Once you decide to call the turn you can't fold to a river shove when you get there unless you have some ridiculous lengthy hand history that would support him only shoving all in the nuts with this line and never bluffs, Kx suited hands, and the numerous combinations of AJ/A10/AX hands no one is really considering.

Turn is kind of thin I guess, but when he checks to you he probably is either giving up or has a Q, so a stab here seems fine, but you really can fire THAT river, the fish just made two pair and he is never ever going to fold here, easy give up.

The Times portrays the ten month build up to Obama Afghan war as an incredibly well thought out process with lots of facts  thousands of pages of briefing memos and maps.

Gee, discussion between people who represent all points of view, right?.

The partnership ended in 1957, when Mirams moved to Australia, leaving O'Shea in command of a company which, he hoped, would enable him to show how a local film industry could demonstrate its relevance to New Zealanders. Reid notes, however, that he recognised that without a significant level of subsidy there wasn't a large enough local audience to provide a return from the feature films that he wanted to make. O'Shea's priorities were clear: money and the commercial side of production were a means to an end, never the end itself.

Honestly, I went into watching Bad Moms exclusively for the comedy. I came out firmer on my CF view point. It's been ages since I watched it, so I'm fuzzy on the specifics. But I remember thinking, I would not want to have these crazy schedules, to have to deal with snobbish moms, or to make the ordeal of a girls night out like moms have to, or are portrayed to in the movie. It's a wholesome comedy movie, through and through, but it also enlightens society on some of the double standards moms face and some of the low points of being a mom.

That's a pretty bleak view on where our future is heading. It's a shame you picked the USA for your example because despite all of its flaws and evil capitalism, it is one of the countries which has benefited the most from automation so far.
