Increased enzymatic degradation and cell death was also reported.Another study published also by Holm, PhD and Nachemson, MD (5) found that if dogs exercised a half hour a day for a period of three months, their discs exhibited increased synthesis of proteoglycans, increased transport rate of large molecules into the disc matrix, increased uptake of glucose, oxygen and glycogen, and increased aerobic metabolism.Overall, these findings indicated that spine should be subjected to adequate motion and exercise to ensure adequate supply to the joints and discs. Prolonged bed rest and/ or traction has a proven deleterious effect. With its accompanying fluid flow and variations in creep deformation, were necessary to preserve the nutritional status of discs and joints.These studies are consistent with a larger body of evidence that has evaluated the clinical effects of bed rest and immobility, both of which have been universally and thoroughly discredited as effective methods of treatment for both back and neck problems.Waddell, MD noted in 1987 (6) that there is a loss of 3% muscle strength per day with complete bed rest.The 1994 AHCPR guidelines on Acute Low Back Problems in Adults (7) warned about the potential complications of bed rest including a 1.0% to 1.5% loss of l muscle mass per day, as well as a 15% loss of aerobic capacity in 10 days.The very recently revised and released 1996 British guidelines (8) summarize the literature on bed rest, noting that there are now 9 randomized controlled studies on bed rest, and their findings confirm that bed rest is counter productive.Similarly, the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash Associated Disorders (9) confirmed that prolonged use of cervical collars probably prolongs disability.Today it is understood that motion plays a critical role in maintaining tissue and joint lubrication/nutrition for both discs and joint articular cartilage.We know that articular cartilage receives its nutrition through the circulation of synovial fluid, which is a filtrate derived from blood vessels within the synovial membrane.In addition, the synovial membrane also contains lymphatic ducts, which provide the pathway for the removal of waste products out of the synovial fluid and the joint space.What is essential to recognize is that the synovial fluid has absolutely no inherent capacity to circulate is no heart forcefully pumping synovial fluid to the joints.

Have you ever actually talked to a woman about how they feel when a man they met recently cries in public? Try going out on a few dates, and on each date talk about something that makes you emotional and start weeping. See how many of them want a second date. Is that toxic femininity? No, because no one uses that term, because it would be seen as insulting to women, because it fucking is. Toxicity is just toxicity. It doesn need to have the "masculinity" attached to it. All things can be toxic. Forms of masculinity can be, forms of femininity can be, things that have nothing to do with gender can be toxic. Throwing the word masculinity into it to describe men being toxic to other men is idiotic. It is pointless. Unless you want to start calling it toxic femininity when women are bitches to other women, but I wouldn expect any sort of consistency from anyone who uses that term.

"This isn't the first time researchers have purportedly resurrected long dead organisms; in 2000, a team claimed to have revived 250 million year old bacteria, though this extraordinary claim requires more evidence before the scientific community will wholeheartedly accept it.

The trick to winning at Monopoly is noticing that not every square is created equal   some squares are much more likely to be landed on than others. The reason for that is because Monopoly has a few curve balls. For example, throwing three doubles in a row sends you to jail; the go directly to jail square; the Chance and Community Chest cards that send you off around different places on the board, and so on.

They're covering emotions today and the health teacher is going around the room just asking for examples of emotions, "happy, sad, mad, angry, frustrated, excited, tired, hungry" not all emotions but totally all close enough. Well we get to this one kid   this one kid who totally meant well but he was a little off. He never tried to be the funny kid, he just was. In that his answers were usually pretty serious. So we get to this one kid and he's asked for an example of an emotion. He's so fucking excited to stand up and yell DINOSAUR!

"Obsession led to envy, which lead to the study of world history of human stink, and it alienated the robots (at first) to discover that humans could do basically nothing to combat their own odors for most of their history.

First, calculate your pot odds. Pot odds are the odds that the pot is laying you to call a bet. For example, if there are 300 chips in the pot, and your opponent bets 100 chips, then you'll be putting in 20% of the total value of the pot (100 chips into a 500 chip pot). Implied odds represent the money that will go into the pot after you catch your draw. The problem with this is that you don't always know how much money your opponent is willing to put into the pot. Sometimes he is bluffing and will fold to any bets from you. Other times, he'll give you his whole stack. Fortunately, there's no guesswork required. Calculating your implied odds accurately is relatively simple. First, look at the size of the pot after calling. Second, multiply the size of the pot times 0.6. This reflects the size of your bet on the next street. If your opponent is aggressive, use 0.8 instead. If he is passive, use 0.4. Third, add this value to the size of the pot and calculate your pot odds again. For example, if there are 300 chips in the pot, and your opponent bets 100 chips, and he is aggressive, your pot odds are 1 in 5, but your implied odds are more like 1 in 9, so you can profitably call with a lot of hands that you would have folded because you have a more accurate representation of the reward of calling.
