Yet another possible explanation for the word poker, is that it came from a version of an underworld slang word, "poke," a term used by pickpockets. Cardsharps who used the 20 card cheating game to relieve a sucker from his poke may have used that word among themselves, adding an r to make it "poker."

Researchers looked into games of other countries to see if there was any game whose name sounded anything like "poker." They came up with an eighteenth century French game called poque , a German game that involves a certain amount of bluffing called Pochspiel , and there's even a suggestion that the word derived from a Hindu word: pukka .

Change is constant, as the proverb goes. And inonline poker, this is an adage that a winning online poker player believes in. Change your online poker appearance by changing gears constantly. If you are playing long enough with the same opponents then it's just a matter of time that they will recognize your pattern. In order to prevent this from happening, you must take the time and evaluate your own game. See what you have done so far and try to achieve the same or better results differently. If you bluff often then take it seriously the next round and vice versa. The ability to change your game style can move you ahead from your opponents.

But an easier and more effective way is to simply prevent them from being in that situation at all. Pay them to not be there, so that they don have to choose between making rent that month and spreading disease around. Pay them to go to doctor appointments, so that if they do get sick, it can be caught faster and treated better.

So well was the whole process simulated, that I should have been quite deceived, had I not seen that the fly was still upon the window.

He never specifically answered which of the three options was easiest to beat, but he did tell me that somebody playing (a solid game) live cash in Vegas, Atlantic City, Los Angeles, or Florida would win money considerably faster (on average) than a player who plays $500 $1000 tournaments, live or online.

Sustainability in ingredients is a huge passion for me, so personally for my botanical brand, I only use sustainably sourced ingredients, many of them wild harvested in ethical amounts from naturally occurring ecosystems. For this same reason I refuse to use animal products in my goods (save for ethically sourced Honey absolute) as it's inhumane, gross, or unsustainable (mainly thinking of animal musks here). I also make my own tinctures for base oils for my blends, which someone mentioned isn't that common for brands.

Our analyses also show that emotional strategies continue to work well during downturns, although there is a need to match the competitive price and promotional messages that proliferate during these times. Nothing can guarantee brand immortality, especially in a recession, but powerful, emotionally engaging campaigns are proven to help. In addition, we can see that emotional engagement increases in importance during the life cycle of market sectors, as persuasion based strategies progressively lose the product differentiation they depend upon. There are very few effective persuasion campaigns in declining categories in the IPA Databank. Debate over.

Eventually, the nail trend spread west across Asia and into Africa. Henna has been found painted on mummies, including their nails, but flashy red shades were also used. Nail color signified class in Egypt, too. The redder one's nails in ancient Egypt, the more power the person had. Queen Nefertiti, step mother of King Tutankhamun, wore dark red nails, a color rumored to have blood in it. Cleopatra is said to have painted her nails from the juice of the henna plant, which created a deep, rusty color. Women of lower rank were allowed to wear pastel colors only.

Well, more realistically, the word "poker" probably finds its origins in the underworld of thieves. Some of the card hustlers may have already been using the expression since "poke" was a slang word used by pickpockets.

Gavin Andresen was fired from Bitcoin Core, and despite what people here would have you believe, it was for a good reason. Even though it hurts me to say this, they acted like real professionals. That was probably the only time they acted like they were effectively in control of a billion dollar project only implementation. It stands to reason that people with this level of professionalism wouldn keep a dev in such an influential position after discovering that he is literally insane. (Or he is trolling, which would be a far greater success than bitcoin.)

When I asked them about taking on such huge debt loads, they said "I was born in debt. I die in debt. What difference does it make how much debt." Okay, they weren econ or accounting majors, but really? Is that the lesson we taught the next generation?

There are two extremes you can swing between when rehabbing and flipping a home: the "I have to have it   this house is the ONLY house" extreme, and the "Nah, something better will always come along" extreme. Both ends of the spectrum are dangerous. If you're SO invested in a house that you HAVE to have it, it will be easily read on your face. You may as well write "Take advantage of me" in felt tip pen on your forehead, while you're at it. On the other hand, if you're so preoccupied with finding the BEST deal that you sacrifice many good, profitable deals along the way, you'll not only miss out on opportunities but you'll end up too confused to think straight by the end of it all. Keep it simple: find one good deal and see it through.

If we compare this to a spot like CO vs BB on a 456r board where we hold 23s on the button and V should not have any combos of 73, and only the suited combos of 78 we could much more reasonably 3b the flop.

The disadvantage is that by not accumulating chips early you often find yourself needing to "double up" in the middle stages of the tournament. As an example, imagine a situation early in the tournament where someone has already raised, and you have a small pair like 44 or 55. An aggressive player, though, might call the raise.

Well, I was an absolute idiot and started with Ethics. I figured, well, its the first section of the first book, I should go in order. And yeah, not a fun time.

Well, it usually easier when you initiate the breakup but when I broke up with my ex he prevented any doubts I would have had. I got at least 300 calls from him and a few thousand text messages that ranged from sad and apologetic to angry and threatening. The next day I decided to go hiking with a friend to get away from the stress and didn look at my phone all day until my mother called and asked if I needed to get a ride because he was out looking for me. Apparently he showed up at my house and after I wasn there he went out to the woods to find me. I was terrified. He then got any mutual friends we had to "reason" with me. This is after he has been angry, controlling and isolating for over a year. I tried to end it numerous times but he would threaten to hurt himself. He would take my phone and read my messages and get angry if I talked to anyone without his knowledge. He didn let me spend time with anyone else and even got mad when I went out with my sisters. If I said something he didn like he would snap at me and then be irritable for days. He didn like me wearing certain clothes because I "looked too good in them". He isolated me from my friends and family and made me scared and miserable all the time. And then I became the bad guy when I had the courage to get away from him. When he found out I was seeing someone new, he sent me this message:

If you behind on life, but with both players having a modest board presence, Revenge often swaps life totals: if you got half of their life, you trade life.

In turn, that means your opponent can force you into sub optimal blocks with their attacks, so they might be less inclined to attack. That by itself helps you stabilize.
