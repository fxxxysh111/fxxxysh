I did, because of both because of your repeated fighting with me about how you feel I should interpret the rules of this subreddit and because of the hateful remarks I was continually having to remove from this post. Shortly before my removal there was another discussion starting about vigilante justice and dragging people behind trucks to get justice for the dog. I didn feel like actively monitoring a single post for so much garbage anymore, which was the entire reason I removed your comment earlier. After years of moderating this community I know how simple it is to get people riled up and get them talking about garbage such as that. I knew where it was headed and tried to cut it off before if could go there by removing your comment. A conversation about finding the person responsible and paying to do so and another conversation about dragging the person deemed responsible behind a fucking truck in the same post are NOT something that I am willing to leave up on our subreddit.

They are also related to the (slightly larger and paler) Rough Legged Buzzard (Buteo lagopus) but are not in the same genus as the (paler, slimmer headed) Honey Buzzard (Pernis apivorus).

TOMATO PASTE. This is one of my favourites. When a recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, don cover the rest of the can with foil and shove it into the back of the fridge. Scrape it into a freezer proof bag, press out the air and freeze. Snap off pieces as you need it; just guesstimate what a tablespoon would be, and usually you can just add it frozen to a recipe. Most recipes calling for tomato paste involve heating it, and it will melt and blend in quickly.

Focus more on the human side of management. In his 1996 article, "The Human Side of Management", Thomas Teal noted that "mediocre management is the norm" and that one reason for this is that "in educating and training managers, we focus too much on technical proficiency and too little on character But we're still in the Dark Ages when it comes to teaching people how to behave like great managers   somehow instilling in them capacities such as courage and integrity that can't be taught. Perhaps as a consequence, we've developed a tendency to downplay the importance of the human element in managing." Twenty years later, this still rings true.

Note that it not necessarily a problem on its own, just that it placed a level of burden on the programmer to take care to an extent that we were uncomfortable with.Almost always, we would end up having to rethink the dependency on time for performance considerations, and typically would attach the time first to some relevant Event before making further use of it, which would allow for better caching of intermediate results.Eventually that turned into just dropping support for a current time behaviour altogether as we gradually came to realize it was regularly an issue.

You can usually pick and choose between different styles of teaching; some teachers are very good and some are just simply mediocre. Never judge the teacher on their performance credentials as there are a lot more excellent musicians than excellent teachers. You simply have to ask around.

What should i do a couple people including me are basically 100% convinced he cheated but without solid proof it seems banning him from our games is the wrong thing to doIts always better to just be up front with people. I would literally just call him out and say "Hey so this last weekend I suspect you were cheating, a set over set over set is on the same level of odds as me getting a blowjob from Kate Upton and the fact I stared you down as I folded my set and you seemed surprised further makes me think you set it up. So I am giving you the chance to pay out what you took from that other guy or you probably wont be invited back." This gives him the chance to come clean to you but its also you being nice and not calling him out in front of the group. This will also give you a read on whether you think he is being honest or not. If he gets all pissy and denies it then more than likely he is lying. But if he just cant believe you would think that then maybe he didnt. Like I said it gives you a chance to read him and decide if you want to escalate it to the group or not.

One important way to assist your immune system is a lymphatic massage that uses essential oils. Lymph nodes are located around the body, particularly in the throat, groin, breasts, and under the arms. They are like filtering centers for cleansing the blood. The lymphatic system moves cellular fluid through the system, cleansing the body of waste produced by the body's metabolic functions. Lemon, rosemary, and grapefruit are especially good at stimulating movement and supporting the cleansing action. A lymphatic massage involves deep strokes that work from the extremities toward the heart. You can even do this on yourself. Rub the oil up your arms to the lymph nodes in your armpits. From the center of your chest, rub again toward the armpit, and then down your neck. Massage your legs from your feet up to the groin.

Facebook Zynga symbiosis is extreme, Ulrich notes. the company entire future is based on Facebook, then Zynga would be likely to be acquired by Facebook. to Wharton management professor Lawrence Hrebiniak, most strategic alliances unless they result in an acquisition fail over time. If Zynga is able to diversify, the company could continue as an independent game developer. But that outcome also has its challenges. business model depends on developing cool games and new titles to replace older ones. How long can Zynga do that? By the time the Facebook deal expires, Zynga may not be viable. on Zynga IPO filing, the company is well aware of fierce competition in the gaming space. The firm cited Electronic Arts, Walt Disney, mobile game developers such as Rovio (which makes Angry Birds) and other companies as competitors. Zynga also noted that companies that do not make social games today may decide to enter the market in the future. These potential rivals include Amazon, Google, Yahoo and, ironically, Facebook.

I went to an event last night and one of the things the charity does is give education grants. One grant was given to a dietitian masters student studying the effect high BMI has on the prenatal/postnatal care on women. That in itself is good as being overweight shouldn mean poor healthcare or being treated shitty but in her speech it became apparent that her study is more along the "fatlogic" line that weight loss is way more complicated than CICO and she wants to create a place where there is no discussion of obesity or weight when talking to pregnant women. I guess I just don advocate doctors ignoring one component of health. She was saying things like dietitians need to believe patients when they say what they eat, etc. It was cringey for me as I feel when it comes to eating habits people are generally unreliable narrators and you cannot trust the self reporting. I also expect my doctor to politely and respectfully discuss my weight just as my doctor politely and respectfully told me I was advanced maternal age and what effects that could have on my daughter and my pregnancy. My doctor didn say your fat ass is old to be having a baby or it is a geriatric pregnancy and she didn act like I would be a bad parent having a baby at a later age. She just directly discussed with me and my husband what tests she recommends, etc. (ex. we had a meeting with a geneticist, had the fold screen, etc) for 1st time pregnant women of an older age.

2. The reason Dlamini Zuma is not speaking out or promoting herself is a tactical move by her strategy team. They have realised that the team's she is receiving support from are causing more damage than good to her chances of being ANC president. She is reevaluating her position and possible ties with the Zuma camp. I think it should be noted that there is a reason she isn't married to Zuma anymore. She may be a Zulu, but that does not mean she bats for his team wholeheartedly. She must see that his brand and political power is diminishing quickly and will count for nothing come December.

Out of position you might want to x/r a low flush draw on a dynamic board a high percentage of the time with an spr of 13, with an spr of 36 you might have to be much more careful (1) playing out of position on a board that may have a lot of texture shifts and where in position gains the ability to put immense pressure with a deeper stack and (2) putting non nutted hands in what may turn out to be a very polarized line at that spr. The same ideas will apply to some of your flop value x/r Some types of value hands will change from not having reverse implied odds to having them, depending on the spr.

For better or worse, traditional probability problems tend to involve gambling problems, such as die games and card games, perhaps because they are the most commonplace examples of truly equiprobable sample spaces.

The A comes on the flop, since charlie is holding the other A, there is exactly 1 case combo of AA from his opponent. If his opponent does not have AA, he will be chopping with oddly played limp 4 bet AK as far as value goes. There is no reason to raise this flop because it will just fold out all his opponents bluffs which is why he takes a check call line. They started about 170 big blinds deep and given that the hand was 4 bet preflop, there really is no other line given his stack to pot ratio after the flop but to eventually stack off with his hand here. Its very unlikely that a hand like AJ would have taken this line from his opponent, and even a hand like JJ rarely takes this line. If his opponent did do something bizarre and spazzy, the natural play is to check call and allow a spazzy opponent to bluff the rest of the chips off on the turn whereas raising will just give the opponent a chance to fold his bluffs.
