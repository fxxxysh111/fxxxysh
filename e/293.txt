But I think we still have a range advantage on 678ss vs. a big blind callers range, because we have all sets, overpairs, flush draws, often two pairs depending on our raising position, and many gutters. if villain has KK or AA he is probably not folding here on the turn especially if he is a loose player so I would bet full pot. obviously he could have something like 88 that might not be able to fade pot pot but still the general principle applies. or if u have ace high flush and really the only calling hands for villain are k or q hi flush then again u want to bet potSo if the flop was Q72 rainbow then you would often want to consider betting only half the flop because there are no draws at all. And you would want to bet this sizing whether you were betting 22 or AQ. You would want to over bet the pot if you had a lock and were certain villain also had a very strong hand.

Sustainability in ingredients is a huge passion for me, so personally for my botanical brand, I only use sustainably sourced ingredients, many of them wild harvested in ethical amounts from naturally occurring ecosystems. For this same reason I refuse to use animal products in my goods (save for ethically sourced Honey absolute) as it's inhumane, gross, or unsustainable (mainly thinking of animal musks here). I also make my own tinctures for base oils for my blends, which someone mentioned isn't that common for brands. Going further into ethics, make sure the suppliers for your EOs and such are not employing child or slave labor, as that can occur in products that are sourced half way around the world.

The effective stack size is definitely one of the bigger factors at play here and I think to call it off we would need some type of history or read about the type of player V is. 
This is being dressed up as an act of unparalleled generosity, which is scarcely surprising given that those who give, even if very little, are apt to flatter themselves by making it appear more than it is. But what is surprising is that we are proving to be the chumps that we always tend to be when dealing with America. Instead of looking cynically at the Kerry Lugar bill and running a fine comb through it, we are behaving like a latter day Uncle Tom, grateful for the small change (in relative terms) we are about to get, almost like a tip for services rendered. America's military effort in Afghanistan costs upwards of 60 billion dollars a year. This is the backdrop against which to see our 1.5 billion dollars, which don't seem like an awful lot then.

Because in 2013 Asians identified as 11.8%, double the sum of the 2001 census, and out of this 11.8%, 31.6% were overseas born (See Figure One below). On this basis, it is predicted that by 2026, people identifying themselves as Asian will be the second largest ethnic grouping within NZ behind the sluggishly growing Caucasian majority, and surpassing the tngata whenua, Mori (See Figure Two below).(Bridget Williams Books, $99.99)Reviewed by Mark DerbyThis imposing tome seems more likely to be bought as a prestigious gift, or an adornment for the coffee table, than to become a carefully perused and frequently consulted addition to your personal book collection.

You might say "we don't understand completely if there was a 'before'" but you can't say "there was a before, we simply can't view those events." And I think even the former is stretching it. But hey, we're talking about how religious people view science here, and religious people are all to eager to presuppose things for which there is no evidence. 
Since poker is all about money, people are always going to find a way to cheat. It's unavoidable. Where I deal people like to "run it twice" which I'm sure they didn't do in your day either. Many players say it's too reduce variance, which is mathematically correct in an all in situation.

Obi Wan defensive Form III lightsaber style is designed to synergize with his carefully planned military maneuvers; as he only strikes when prepared, he can always hold the strategic high ground (That business on Cato Neimodia doesn count). You come to realize that this is why Commander Cody artillery strike failed against Obi Wan, when hundreds of Jedi were killed in similar attacks. Cody failed to grasp the strategic situation, as the Jedi Master elevation was superior to his by hundreds of meters, making him virtually unkillable (You notice that all the Jedi killed in Order 66 were on level ground with the clones, thereby assuring their demise). Had Cody taken his time and engaged the Jedi on even terrain, he would have succeeded. Obi Wan subsequently retreated under the surface of the lake, so that he could maintain the topographical low/high ground.

The thing is, the entire store was almost identical to any of the ones that you find in the United States. The layout was the same (albeit mirrored from the one I usually visit, which I chalked up to being one of those driving on the wrong side of the road things), all of the sections were eerily familiar, and many of the expected products were present. There were some small differences   the British rotisserie chicken being one of them   but on the whole, it was like being back at home..

My boyfriend and I had decided to commit suicide together, we were heroin addicts, had screwed up our lives and just wanted to quit. We stole $500 from my mother, and a bottle of her Xanax. We used the money to buy a shit ton of heroin. It was the middle if the night, and we stole her car to go buy the drugs, and we did it in the car in the parking lot of my apartment. I guess I didn want her to find me in the apartment, I didn want her to be the one to find us. So we both took about 15 Xanax pulls, and filled several syringes full of heroin. I only was able to do about two syringes worth until I fell out and was unconcious. It wasn enough to die, just pass out. But I stayed unconcious in the car for about twelve hours, he did too.

"The raindrop technique is a therapy based on traditional massage therapies that has been perfected by Young Living founder Gary Young. Raindrop involves the amazing power of essential oils (which are dispensed in small rain like drops about six inches above the body), mixed with a variety of massage techniques, including back massage, Vita Flex massage and heat application. The technique is designed to bring the body back into structural and electrical alignment. Often, many spinal problems and misalignments are caused by or exacerbated by toxins (such as viruses) that lie dormant within the spinal column. The use of essential oils helps to dispose of these toxins and viruses within the spine, helping its structure return to normal. The raindrop technique can be used as a tool to provide a healthy balance to the body.

That true! I actually somewhat lied. I do go out to eat maybe 4 6 times a year at a local restaurant because the whole point is no tipping.

"The court finds that he has not met this burden."While Berkenkotter's ruling to unseal the case was made immediately available, she put a two week stay on the rest of the documents in the case to give the parties time decide whether to appeal her ruling.Berkenkotter also instructed the attorneys to talk as the case progresses and consider asking the court to unseal documents that do not contain "highly sensitive information."Without any such unsealing orders, documents relating to Collins' hearing to have his case transferred back to juvenile court will remain under seal until the judge rules on the defendant's request to transfer the case."Specifically, these pleadings and any attachments thereto are likely to involve highly sensitive information, including, potentially, medical records and mental health records, as well as other highly confidential information," Berkenkotter wrote. "The court holds that with respect to this narrow category of pleadings, unrestricted access would pose a substantial probability of harm to the fairness of the trial, which substantially outweighs the defendant's right to a public trial."Berkenkotter said the seal on the narrow category of documents was the only option that did not involve individual assessment of every document filed in the case, a process that would be "unwieldy, time consuming and far more importantly for purposes of the court's constitutional analysis could lead to disclosure of highly sensitive and/or confidential material prior to the court having the opportunity to exercise its gatekeeping role as to such information."Collins who was charged as an adult with attempted first degree murder and felony assault on an at risk person is scheduled for a "reverse transfer" hearing on Feb.

By all the standards on which modern ethical consciousness is based, it must be wrong to disregard whole populations in this way: to see them as so incomprehensibly different from ourselves that we cannot imagine them having the same wants and needs. It is tantamount to regarding them as less than human.

Walter Payton is good but, Jamarcus Russell is the best ever. If you don't know who he is, Jamarcus Russell is a future hall of famer. He can even throw 60 yards on knee. In 2009, he lead his team(The Oakland Raiders) to a victory over the defending world champion Pittsburgh Steelers. The guy is the best ever. However, he retired early becasue his knee was shattered in the off season. If he would have stayed with the Oakland Raiders, he would have for sure won a superbowl. (Full Answer)

Reid's rhetoric continued when Romney spoke in front of a group of voters in Reid's home state of Nevada. Sen. Reid continued to muddy the waters by releasing a statement which said in part "Today, the most secretive presidential candidate since Richard Nixon is coming to Nevada, asking to be elected president. Forget about president   Mitt Romney couldn get confirmed as a cabinet secretary." (I guess Sen. Reid is not up to date with the news, or maybe he just forgot about issues such as Solyndra, "Fast and Furious," the leaked military secrets, or the 2008 presidential campaign.)

However, we aren't done yet because we have to make sure that we don't get another queen or two more of the same previous two cards that we drew on the remaining two cards, because either case would result in four of a kind.

THE "fact" that junk food is cheaper than real food has become a reflexive part of how we explain why so many Americans are overweight, particularly those with lower incomes.I frequently read confident statements like, "when a bag of chips is cheaper than a head of broccoli or "it's more affordable to feed a family of four at McDonald's than to cook a healthy meal for them at home."In fact it isn't cheaper to eat highly processed food: a typical order for a family of four   for example, two Big Macs, a cheeseburger, six chicken McNuggets, two medium and two small fries, and two medium and two small sodas   costs, at the McDonald's a hundred steps from where I write, about $28. (Judicious ordering of "Happy Meals" can reduce that to about $23   and you get a few apple slices in addition to the fries!)In general, despite extensive government subsidies, hyperprocessed food remains more expensive than food cooked at home.You can serve a roasted chicken with vegetables along with a simple salad and milk for about $14, and feed four or even six people.If that's too much money, substitute a meal of rice and canned beans with bacon, green peppers and onions; it's easily enough for four people and costs about $9. (Omitting the bacon, using dried beans, which are also lower in sodium, or substituting carrots for the peppers reduces the price further, of course.)Another argument runs that junk food is cheaper when measured by the calorie, and that this makes fast food essential for the poor because they need cheap calories.But given that half of the people in this country (and a higher percentage of poor people) consume too many calories rather than too few, measuring food's value by the calorie makes as much sense as measuring a drink's value by its alcohol content.

For instance, when you are in a stressful situation   or even when you are just thinking about one   your heart rate tends to speed up, your breathing quickens, your blood pressure increases, and your muscles tense up. Conversely, by shifting your thoughts to calming scenes or situations or by consciously taking slow, deep breaths, you can slow your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and ease muscle tension. The biofeedback machine makes these reactions easier to recognize. For example, the machine may be set to beep at every heartbeat, so you can hear when your heart is racing or when it's slowing.

The chance of winning at blackjack doesn't change because the game is played electronically. But here's the important distinction: It's electronic.

To measure blood levels based on breath, you need to know the vapor pressure of the substance   which is how a compound behaves when it moves from being a liquid to a gas, such as when a molecule leaves your blood and is exhaled in your breath.

Scientists said they expect the new study to start shifting research toward early environmental factors, in particular prenatal conditions for developing fetuses.One study along those lines, also published in Monday Archives of General Psychiatry, looked at the possible role of maternal antidepressant use before and during pregnancy.The study of 298 autistic children in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system found a two fold increase in risk of the disorder when mothers took antidepressants at some point in the year before giving birth.The study doesn prove that the antidepressants actually caused autism, and researchers stressed that women taking such drugs should not stop if they are pregnant or about to become pregnant.

Idk who downvoted you, but when she visited she just made her usual excuses about why she too busy to clean up the mess in her house. I never actually met anyone in person I had something like this sort of in common with. When my mom married my step dad he owned this fixer upper house in an upscale neighborhood, but he never ended up fixing it up. From the time I was 8 until I moved in with my dad at 14, the house just slowly fell apart while we lived in it. Like there was these big holes in the kitchen, hallway, and other places that went to the basement, and I fell in several times, like legs waving around in the basement while my torso was still on the ground floor of the house and I had to pull myself out. Plus, my step dad was a low level hoarder so the house was packed with junk and piles of junk and the kitchen in general was just always a mess and everything was cluttered, so it wasnt always easy to avoid these holes. In the winter we didn have heat bc too much of it escaped. And he had a pretty good job, and always kept the exterior of the house looking nice so our neighbors wouldn know. We weren allowed to have anyone over.

I started to get very depressed because the pain was so bad and I thought I was going crazy because they kept telling me the pain isn't as bad as you think but I had to learn how to do everything left handed because of the extreme pain. I gained a ton of weight because every movement hurt and doctors kept telling me I was crazy.

I didn realize I was bisexual until I was 16, and by that time my parents had gotten out of that belief system and swung back to the left leaning they had in college, so they were very supporting and accepting.

If you asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in depth or highly plot reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.

The craziest parts of it all   one, the infection was caused by the same bacteria that gives people acne outbreaks. Two, a month before my infection was discovered, I started dating an amazing woman. During my hospital stay was the first time she met my mother (what a way to meet), and during the months of inconvenience that followed she stuck by my side, doing things like helping me flush my PICC line and dealing with the horrid mess that can result from a wound vacuum not sealing properly (I spare the gross details but the mess and odor can be appalling). She met me and shortly after I was at my lowest. It would have been super easy and somewhat understandable to want to bail on somebody in my situation, less than a month into a new relationship. She stayed by my side for every second, letting my cry on her shoulder when I was frustrated, she kept my spirits up when I had to give myself shots in the stomach to replenish my incredibly low iron levels, and she kept me optimistic and hopeful.

So we are hearing from the likes of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner that executives have been taking huge risks for years now with no costs to them. Executive pay stays the same or goes up no matter what happens to the companies they run. Geithner even went so far as to suggest that this might be a major reason we in this economic mess. CEOs pursing profit for themselves regardless of longterm economic stability came up with brilliant plans to make money out of thin air by financializing everything and producing nothing.
The papasan seemed eager to tout the girls in the first fishbowl, but I didn think they were especially better than the girls in the second.

Yeah, that rough. The game always suggests low pop realms and I wish they didn do that though, they did it with Dalaran for literal years and it now a high pop realm I think, so it can pick up speed with time. The issue is that (obviously) BfA isn doing that hot and people aren coming into the game like they were before, so the chance of your server picking up speed now, even if it listed as a recommended place for new players, is low.
Right now is still a great opportunity for those on the sidelines.

Some Star Wars fans even got offended by the fact that the new protagonist is some random orphan.

Overview for garlic
I used the technique in today's spicerich lentil dal, a soup bursting with flavour.When using ground spices or spice blends in cold preparations such as salads and sandwich fillings, in most cases I find there's no need to bloom them in hot oil before mixing them in.Store bought ground spices are finely ground and the moment they come in contact with a wet ingredient, such as mayonnaise or vinaigrette, their flavour begins to bloom. If you allow the spices in the dressing for that salad or sandwich filling to steep and develop a short while, they'll do a fine job flavouring your creation.That's certainly how I felt after digging into today's recipe for curried shrimp stuffed papaya. The mayonnaise based shrimp filling chills and melds in the refrigerator an hour before being spooned into the papaya, giving it plenty of time to develop flavour.However, in some salads that I'll serve right away, such as a Singapore noodle salad, I will "bloom" the curry powder used in oil first.

Thanks to our superstitions and customs, certain numbers tend to be more popular choices than others meaning that if they come up, the jackpot is shared among more people. On a standard lottery game where you have to choose 6 numbers between 1 and 49, Poundstone says any of the following numbers will give you a better shot at the full jackpot: 10, 20, 29, 30, 32, 38 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, 49.

The correlation tracks back to hormone exposure in the womb. Higher levels of testosterone lead to both a longer ring finger compared to the index finger and higher math skills. Higher levels of estrogen mean a shorter ring finger compared to the index finger as well as higher verbal ability [sources: Live Science, University of Bath]. A related study showed that male academics in science tended to have very little difference in digital ratio, which meant they had almost equal levels of testosterone and estrogen   thus possessing both verbal and numeracy skills [source: Curtis].

She writes that attraction in particular thrives on the excitement of the "other" and if your identities are too intertwined, or one or both are too interdependent, the other ceases to exist. By separating your lives and identities some, you can recover that feeling of otherness by adding some mystery back in the relationship. It is far more interesting to hear about your spouses day when you don already know every detail. And discovering new things about yourself means your partner will have new things to discover about you too. The attraction to these other women is likely the result of how exciting it is to get to know someone at first.

Additionally, it reached out to its talent pool through SMSes, posters, e mailers and FB campaigns and got over 60 creative expressions for the brand in the form of TVCs. There were multiple winners in both legs and they won HTC phones.

A lot of great Texas Holdem players also try their hand in playing Omaha. Even if these players are not so familiar with Omaha, they play their hands at high limits because they are great at Holdem poker. The problem is these players loose after just on flop. The reason is in Holdem, when you get a pair, that makes it a strong hand already. In Omaha, a pair may mean you loosing a lot of money. In Omaha poker, a player is rarely paid when he holds a pair but will often pay competitors with a higher pair, a flush or a straight.

They take a small percentage of each pot, called a rake. Some casinos, instead of a rake, charge a seat fee, sometimes called a "time drop". The way this works is that every half hour, when you get a new dealer at your table, the dealer will collect the fee, usually about $3. If you are a good player, playing only quality hands, and happen to be getting nothing but garbage for an hour, and are not able to successfully bluff to at least pick up a little bit at all in that hour, in addition to getting blinded to death, you're out an additional $6. In my opinion, the rake is much more fair to the players, only charging the ones who are making the money.

In most poker variants, such as Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha, there are 5 shared cards, or community cards dealt. This is simply because the rules are as such. There are other variants of poker, such as 7 Card Stud (Every player first receives 2 cards face down, 1 face up. Then a player can choose to "throw cards away" and draw other cards. The ammount of cards that can be drawn is the same as the cards you threw away. So 1 card thrown away, means you can draw 1 new card. There are variants which allow up to 3 draws. In this variant there are no shared   or community   cards dealt.) (Full Answer)

One caution about massage. The carotid arteries, which run along either side of the neck, have nerve endings that respond to changes in blood pressure.

Bill passed peacefully at home surrounded by his family on Saturday, December 8, 2012, in his 82nd year after a brief battle with brain cancer. Bill was born on December 18, 1930 in Wildwood, Alberta. He was a devoted father and will be dearly missed by his only daughter Maryvonne and his son in law Richard Johnson. Much loved Gaga to Patrick Johnson. Predeceased by loving wife Diana Buchinski (2008) and sister Nancy Loney. Survived by brothers Nick Buchynski, John Buchinsky, sister Mary Golinsky and his nieces Anne (Brian) Perro, Jo Anne Hind and nephews Craig (Didi) Hind and Richard Hind Jr. and other extended family. He was a dedicated family man, and especially cherished his one and only grandson. Bill was a loyal employee of Stelco for 38 years with a wonderful staff, and also served on the Board of Directors for First Ontario Credit Union for many years. He was an avid golfer and will be missed by all of his golfing buddies. He also loved his poker nights with the boys for many years. He was a very respected and honorable man. Anyone who met him loved him. Special thanks to all of his and our dear friends who were supportive during this brief illness.

Yup, I live in a community like this outside DC. It a wealthy suburb that been ranked one of the best places to live in the US, whatever that worth. It also home to a decent population of both low income and homeless folk. The homeless shelter is about a five minute walk from me and aside from being asked for change every now and then, no homeless person has ever bothered me. I used to walk past a tent city (just adjacent to the shelter) to get to work, and while I did have some interesting encounters (I once watched a fully clothed barefoot man pull himself out of a retention pond and walk, dripping wet, to the nearby hospital), I never felt unsafe or harassed.

You can only do this once with the same person (maybe twice if you skilled), but what works better is telling someone about a Trump story, but use Obama name. Ideally one that you know they will get worked up over. Once they espoused their hatred, reveal that you made a mistake, and that it was actually Trump. They probably backpeddle somewhat with some kind of rationalizing.
Now, the House and Senate have passed spending measures that differ in one crucial way   the House bill includes the $5 billion Trump is demanding for a wall and the Senate version, passed a day earlier, does not.Trump says he'll only sign a spending bill with the border money, and senators of both parties say there's no chance their chamber will change its position and fund a wall.

But it really helps when I add a dallop of greek yogurt as well and my 2 scoop 26g protein shakes go up to 40g per shake with 100g greek yogurt.

We all know playing against a maniac can be frustrating but invigorating as well. This is one of those situations where my instincts guide me more than my poker calculator software, especially if you are seated near the maniac and you know you're going to be heads up. Check the hand list below for hands that you can add to your tight aggressive play. Holding most of these hands your poker calculator is going to be telling you to fold. Your strategy here should be to re raise the maniac and get him heads up. Call down if you have to but let him know you won't play dead, which is what your software will be suggesting.

The second half of this problem was the immense amount that was being bought online by underaged users with a credit car mommy and daddy gave them, and then they ignored the bill for. (I should note that this problem has for the most part died down, as every real website for vapes in the US now requires age verification of some for further than "hey when were you born, enter the date here") Basically shitty parents were just giving their kids a card, letting them do whatever they wanted, and then when they had payed no attention for months or years and found a vape in their kids rooms they got mad that the rest of the world wasn't watching their kid for them..

If a legit Purge were to become a reality it would spark a massive breakdown in society. First, think of the shitshow that would take place immediately after the announcement. Liberal groups and gun rights advocates would have a PR field day playing "what if", insurance prices would skyrocket, panic and sheer terror would grip those who know they would never stand a chance, families would break down as arguments rage over who would participate and who would not. Advancements in any field that does not directly correlate to the purge would stop as offensive and defensive products would take priority in development, along with astronomical price increases, and the first purge hasn even started yet.

The same sex marriage advocates don care about everyone children since most poor children are born outside of marriage and over 90% of African American children are born outside of marriage.

The crowd roared on Court 5 when Isner finally won a game after 32 minutes to trail 2 1 in the second set. His shots began to show more zip, but his movement remained sluggish.

That article also says that you can be "not incapacitated enough" to be incapable of giving consent. So if someone is drunk but not blacked out there's question if they truly consented or if they were raped. Intoxication can be used to dismiss a court case bc "if they were drunk how do we know they remember or didn't consent and then forget" which is fucked up..

Fast forward to December 2012. To keep a very long story short, an infection attached itself very deeply and aggressively to the hardware in my spine. Ended up in the ER, and tried to treat it with heavy doses of IV antibiotics and then a surgery after that failed to disinfect it. Horrifically, that didn work either and I spent months on a portable wound vacuum and continuous IV drip to fight it. That also didn work. The final result was undergoing spinal surgery yet again to have the metal hardware removed. The good news   my spine had fused properly and was strong enough without the metal. The bad news   over time my spinal curve has regressed significantly.

It will add to your daily protein macro, but it won trigger muscle building as effectively as when you were 20.Two solutions to beating anabolic resistance is to either eat twice as much protein per hit (40g at a time), or eat the the original 20g mixed with 5g leucine (avoid BCAA mixes because all 3 types of BCAA use the same enzyme so your leucine doesn spike as high, which is something you want to happen for max protein synthesis)But remember: chase functional fitness and body composition and the weight will take care of itself.ProfaneMonkeyCapers  7 points  submitted 2 days agoWorking on shedding the spare tyre before I get so old that it becomes a problem.

It is true that much of the physical infrastructure was destroyed in the war, but that ignores the institutional infrastructure the Japanese left behind. These included the public school system and the legal system, among other civil service institutions, many of which were already staffed by Koreans at the time of Japanese surrender, who continued afterwards. Most of these people were not "collaborators" in any meaningful sense, they were just civil servants who needed jobs during the occupation and were happy to keep them afterwards. 
The AO3 Policy Abuse committee has received a complaint regarding your work "Worth the Candle", stating that it violates the AO3 "no commerce" rule. 
Loyalty isn about who respects these imaginary relationship boundaries you insisting exist. My best friend, whom I met when i was 5, dated a guy for a couple of months and decided she didnt like him. A couple of years later, i dated the same dude (for a year) and remained friends with her. She also remained friends with an ex that I would never speak to again, but that isn MY friendship, its hers, so who cares? It doesn affect my daily life, the boyfriend we both dated moved on with his life and we moved on with ours, and we still close friends. Friendship is about respect, yes, but respect for each other and each other lives outside of our own.

Games like league and Starcraft used to show MMR but moved to ranked divisions because showing a shiny graphic upgrading is more compelling then watching a number rise to your average player.

Why would Dennis not simply initiate the break and accept that Button will retire? Partly because of what Button brings to the team as a driver, but also because of his very high marketing value.

The emphasis on sports is a function of enhanced reach and the fact that live content is a demonstrably more efficient platform through which to deliver advertising impressions. Eliminating the predations of the DVR from the media calculus automatically gives a live broadcast a significant advantage over pre recorded shows, which bleed ad views in a direct proportion to the frequency with which they are time shifted. In other words, those delayed viewing numbers distributed by the networks are effectively useful only as a means with which to estimate the number of people who skipped, zapped or otherwise sidestepped the commercials.

As I recall, Eugene mother was wanted by some important government official as a mistress, even though she was married with children. So, Eugene family ran away but got caught.
