"Within linear TV, New Fox appears to have a great strategy, which is to focus on large simultaneous viewing sports and news," Netflix opined last fall in a note to shareholders.

I'm not a medical doctor or someone whose line of work ever involves crime scenes, but I think when they originally released that information, they said that the BAC was high even for decomposition (indicating the tiniest amount of doubt). I read a scientific article that said there is not always alcohol present in a stomach because of decomposition, but some factors, like exposure to extreme heat, were more likely to cause a post mortem high BAC. So, personally, I believe that it was just decomposition, but I don't think it's that crazy to speculate that it may have been because she drank alcohol. She had been with her friends pretty constantly prior to arriving home, though, and I can't imagine any of them would have let their pregnant friend drink.
This decision time virtually disappears when you talking automated stopping. Volvo even has massive trucks that can automatically stop on a dime to avoid collisions. 
If you were to ask me to define Page as software versus a physical object it would be hard to come down on one side or the other. Whilst this Page user preference for bordered areas makes it a little more UI looking the ambiguity of Page on both the Kahlo and Shaja maps is purposeful. This is a casual thing to use for someone in the 28th century, and not something that goes out of its way to scream that it from the future.
The issue is feminism isn't all about equality. Many white people call for equality and recognize when they have advantages over black people for example. They call this out and demand equality even at their own expense. Feminists typically don't do this. They only advocate for things they think isn't in their favor. But when something favors women they won't say anything. I dated a feminist for two years and she was very active in the feminist community. I actually viewed feminism is a positive light but when I began to associate with feminists that changed. Most of the women are not just about equality. It's seemed like more of a vendetta against masculinity to be honest. I know there is the whole incel stereotype but there is some truth to that. It was quite obvious some of the women had never been romantically involved with men before. Some were also emotionally unstable and seemed to use feminism as a coping mechanism for problems in their life that weren't necessarily sexist. Not all of them are like this. But I personally don't think women my age are oppressed. It seemed like a easy scape goat for my ex girlfriend at times. When in reality it wasn't a sexism thing.

The practitioner of qi gong trains in order to master three groups of exercises: those that regulate the body, those that regulate the heart and mind, and those that regulate breathing.

No one has a crystal ball that works every time, but you could try forecasting what you think you need for retirement, and work backwards to what your super contributions should be from there.

Tom and I had stretched the limits of science once already, to create her. To keep her, we'd have to do it again. The doctors said we could end up with a live baby, a dead baby, or a wrecked baby.

Right? The only one I think he may not do is arresting a man to prevent him from running for Congress. Even that one is possible. It would not surprise me if he helped facilitate something like that. I just can see a future where that particular one does not happen. If he is ever before a grand jury for any reason, and probably if one of his kids went before the jury, he will absolutely threaten the jury through Twitter in 48 hours or less. And there a sentence none of us probably thought we would ever say even just 4 or 5 years ago.

A handful of players have shown glimpses of their full potential while still leaving some room to wonder about their ultimate roles this year. Outfielder Michael Saunders, an All Star in 2016 with Toronto, has been inconsistent as the veteran aims to prove his .158 average in 38 games at the Triple A level last season was a fluke. Fellow outfielder Noel Cuevas, who is attempting to make the 25 man roster as a reserve outfielder after making his MLB debut last season, could potentially start the season in Triple A Albuquerque..

Why doesn't just running farther or faster give you enough of a workout to build leg strength? Running builds endurance, but it's an inefficient way to increase muscular strength. What's needed are workouts that target specific muscle groups in your legs. Runners often fear that weight lifting and other workouts will slow them down, but this isn't something you have to be concerned about if you pursue a balanced exercise regime. Today, both professional and amateur runners use strength workouts to achieve a number of running goals.

Have the dealer begin drawing cards. The dealer is to draw cards, one at a time, from the top of the deck. As the dealer draws cards, if the card matches one of the spaces on a player's game board they are to cover it with one of the poker chips. This process of the dealer drawing cards and players covering the corresponding spaces on their game board continues until one of the players' game boards meets the requirements needed to win one of the pots.

"It sets long term precedents, and I can tell you, for people on my side of the aisle, one of the concerns we should have is if today the national emergency is border security and it entitles him to go out and do something, we all support that.

Indeed, in 1975 it was observed that 'physical fitness and physical education have no respected place in the American public health movement.

Today Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity are continuing to push for the prosecution of Cheney for lying not just about torture, but about the need for invading Iraq in the first place. In other words, Cheney KNEW full well that there were no Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq because the CIA was telling him there were none. Cheney suppressed that intelligence to concoct a story that no one who knew anything about Iraq believed and then sold it to Congress with a side of BS.

You know what else promised a degree to people who didn't deserve one, who didn't do enough to warrant one, and who didn't feel that the current, rigid style of education fit their lifestyle? All those predatory for profit colleges which are being sued and investigated as their degrees have proved worthless.

Time shifting and rampant commercial avoidance have wreaked havoc on the hoary ad supported TV model, and while C3 and the enhanced C7 metric have helped a handful of already high rated shows win back a good deal of impressions that would otherwise be lost to the predations of the DVR, the currency hasn't had much of an impact on the business as a whole. And as ad skipping continues to accelerate, what was originally designed as a stopgap measure is proving no more efficient than holding up a tiny sign that reads "Eep!" right before gravity sends the cartoon coyote careening to the canyon floor.

The long, complicated process of labor and deliver is believed to be started by the baby herself. When the baby reaches full size she releases hormones that in turn trigger the release of a number of other hormones by the mother that cause the muscles of the uterus to contract. These same chemicals also slow the breathing movements of the fetal lungs, which carry amniotic fluid in and out, which had become regular earlier in the third trimester.

If you aren't treated, your immune system will either fail to fight it back and you die or it will be driven into its inactive cyst form. Basically, it creates a biofilm that allows it to go undetected and nestle into your body somewhere. Where that is depends on how the original infection began and how it developed from there. Some people are extremely unlucky like myself and the bacteria crosses the blood brain barrier and enters the CNS which causes intense constant pain, sometimes paralysis, and decreases brain function. Some people, like my husband, have it nestle into the sweet sweet lubrication of a joint, in his case his knee and his spine. It sucks wherever it ends up but symptoms vary because of that.

Sexuality becomes something "other" people have. And those other people are not, of course, as fully human as "people like us." And so debating whether homosexuals should be executed becomes "good journalism." If the journalists at the BBC had stopped for a moment and asked "If I were queer, would I ask this question? How would it feel to be queer and know that if I lived in Uganda I could be killed for loving someone else?" then they know that killing people for the gender of the people they love is no different than killing people for the color of their skin or their religion. It not really up for debate. Ever.

AK, AQ both hands should be a fold to a 3bet against you. Why?   Well, if you 2bet and get 3bet you have two choices: (1) call and you be in a position of weakness or (2) make it 4bet and in that case you cannot get away if opponent 5bets you.

Where I work, we needed to get work done where we did not have the manpower to get said work done. Our Board didn care how that work got done as long as it was within budget. That was passed down the ranks until someone in middle management suggested we contract that work out instead of hiring new employees to do the work as it wasn long term work. It was agreed upon by upper management within the org (not the board as again, didn care as long as it was within budget) that it would be contracted out and that the decision of who it would be contracted out to would be made by someone in middle management. That middle manager responsible hired a contractor based upon various variables and in turn that contractor could complete the work. No repercussions against that middle manager were made because it was a first time issue. Middle manager goes and hires another contractor, new contractor doesn deliver as well. This time middle manager is warned to be more careful in who they hire as the work has to be done and remain under budget. Well, middle manager hires a 3rd contractor who also does not get the work done and things are going over budget. Upper management has to report this to the Board now as there a budget issue. The Board comes down on upper management, who in turn fires the middle manager who hired the 3 bad contractors.

JF Ptak Science Books Post don have that much to say about the series of images that I found in the 5 December 1908 issue of Scientific American except for "Wow!" Sometimes that is about all I can manage, and that fine.

Anyway, opening up the volume and by chance opening to this full pager was very pleasantly surprising, and this from a journal which was very successful in achieving their constant goal of being "surprising". 
So the 49ers took TE Vernon Davis. Not reluctantly, because they really liked Davis and still do.

There are also opening patterns. It not uncommon to hear commentators say things like "and with this move, we transposed into a Slav type defense, except now XXX is on square YY instead of ZZ". If you study opening theory, this sentence alone tells you many things about the position. If you know the ideas behind the Slav, you already know the strengths and weakness of this position, and which strategic ideas make sense and are worth pursuing. Instead of calculating everything from scratch, you can use your knowledge of the Slav to inform and figure out what good and bad about the current position. You just need to give some thought into how the few differences affects the ideas of the Slav without calculating everything from scratch.

When cars replaced carriages, that dashboard came too, as an ordinary slab of wood under the windshield. Dashboard displays, or instrument panels, were a little bit longer in coming. If you needed to know how much gas was left in an early car, you put a stick in your gas tank, and if you wanted to know the temperature, you went to the radiator itself [source: Lamm]. By the 1930s, though, cars started coming with gauges, and by the mid 30's, all cars included what has been graciously termed the "idiot light," or a warning light indicating that something is wrong with the vehicle [source: Lamm]. Even in the present day, manufacturers are tinkering with the instrument panel, moving it to the center of the dashboard or packing it full of technology that may make keeping your eyes on the road harder than ever.

And, on Mars, you don need to spend any energy for orbital capture, and your landing energy is drastically reduced because MOST of your velocity can be bled off in the atmosphere. Sure, you can just land on parachutes, but you can still kill about 5 km/s of delta v through the atmosphere.

Somatosensory neurons (and pain receptors all over the face and head) travel into the central nervous system through the trigeminal nerve.
