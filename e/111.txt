If you looking to get in trim then the park ran is a good option; I think both of the local cycle clubs run shorter distance rides, certainly Velo Walcot does, I think they go along the Bath Bristol cycle path a fair bit, which is also flat! Having only recently got into that I can confirm the people are really welcoming and it a good way to spend a couple of hours. I get knackered talking to people I don know, but it kind of hard to talk as you ride so mostly it people in a group riding but not actually chatting. So you get the enjoyment of being in a group activity, but the social aspect is limited to the odd stop/coffee break!.

What should i do a couple people including me are basically 100% convinced he cheated but without solid proof it seems banning him from our games is the wrong thing to doIts always better to just be up front with people. I would literally just call him out and say "Hey so this last weekend I suspect you were cheating, a set over set over set is on the same level of odds as me getting a blowjob from Kate Upton and the fact I stared you down as I folded my set and you seemed surprised further makes me think you set it up. So I am giving you the chance to pay out what you took from that other guy or you probably wont be invited back." This gives him the chance to come clean to you but its also you being nice and not calling him out in front of the group. This will also give you a read on whether you think he is being honest or not. If he gets all pissy and denies it then more than likely he is lying. But if he just cant believe you would think that then maybe he didnt. Like I said it gives you a chance to read him and decide if you want to escalate it to the group or not.

I recently went back and after trying to outplay my opponents like some of the youtubers I've been watching, I learned that for me at 1 2 ABC poker is a solid low variance approach for me. It took me losing some sessions to figure out even if bluffs are timed right at 1 2 most players are there to gamble.

I had dreamed about it I think every poker player does. But I always knew winning the Main Event was a big long shot. I mean, coming out on top of a field of 6,500 players is pretty rare. This summer the first eight days of the Main Event were played once it got down to about 180 people, I started thinking that I might actually be able to do it. Then, when I made the final nine, I knew it was within reach.

Migraine   Migraine headaches can be caused by reduced blood flow to various areas of the cerebral cortex. Symptoms of migraines include sensitivity to light and noise, nausea, vomiting and intense throbbing pain that is usually on one side of the head. A neurotransmitter, serotonin , is thought to be involved in migraines because many of the drugs used to treat migraines alter the binding of serotonin to various receptors. .

Levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), known to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons, were increased in PD mice after FMD, suggesting an involvement of BDNF in FMD mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, FMD decreased the number of glial cells as well as the release of TNF  and IL 1 in PD mice, showing that FMD also inhibited neuro inflammation.

I can agree some of her language has been shitty and she should apologize for her choice of words, as she has done. It seems a little wild that a freshmen Rep.

I sort of think Wildstar might have found, or at least oriented towards, a good balance. The raids were recognized, even in the narrative, as big collaborative efforts of similarly skilled people. When you interacted with Drusera, while she was soliciting help from YOU, there were beats where she was quite clearly also getting help from other similarly skilled adventurers on other tasks so even though you were clearly important, you weren the ONLY important PC in the game.

NLH isn solved (yet) so preflop solutions, especially by snowie which advocates cold calling 3bets which is ridiculous in practice, are very susceptible to changes in the metagame. Even this pack doesn account for different opening sizes or different 3b/4b sizes.

I had these two awesome girls who were gay in one of my upper grade classes, and one of them asked if she could use my classroom to ask her friend to go out to prom. Yes, I know this sounds like STDH stuff, but people are people, and this is a true story. She just asked me to let her come in to class about 5 minutes late and let her do her thing for a few minutes.
Kevyn Williams said the club was extremely proud of what it had achieved, given it chipped in about $70,000 to the project. "We were probably forced into looking at the whole concept of the place now that they've built the Huon Hill Hotel across the road," he said. "We've cement rendered the whole facade of the built and built a covered area for meals and entertainment, which cost us quite a bit of money." The club has also replaced all its old furniture.

The only part of this response that I don't buy at all is that the right is "calm." If you've talked to a Trump supporter, you'd know how fucking batshit crazy they are because they are completely divorced from reality. Liberals yelling about how the Trump Admin should not abuse children/babies, shaming the President for encouraging violence toward the press, colluding with a foreign enemy (along with other member of the GOP, several of whom spent the 4th of July in motherfucking Russia) is not the same as people on the right screaming about how Obama is a secret Muslim from Africa, and Hillary and the Deep State are conspiring to attack Trump, and Hillary is also running a pedophile ring out of the non existent basement of a fucking pizza restaurant. The difference is one side is making arguments from real events and the other is in the safe space of their imaginations where all sorts of mental gymnastics can confirm their beliefs.

I also would recommend against calling it a music group; maybe something more like music guided mindfulness? That would at least seem less music therapy ish and more therapeutic use of music..

Physical Therapist to Massage Therapist Physical therapists who wish to earn secondary licensing as massage therapists must complete at least a certificate program in massage therapy, providing the 500 to 1,000 hours of instruction needed for state licensing. Physical therapists who wish to earn a more advanced credential as board certified massage therapists must have a minimum of 750 hours of education in massage therapy, and 250 hours of hands on clinical experience. They should apply through the certification board's "portfolio review" process, which evaluates the physical therapist's education and verifies that it's comparable to the education required for a board certified massage therapist.

Sorry if this is obvious but I'm only about 5 months into my first devops job and every time i go to someone for help, without fail, the first thing they say is something like "did you break it down ?" So are you consistently trying to break problems down into the smallest problems possibly? Even something moderate seems insurmountable if you just look at it as a whole without starting to take it apart. I struggle with those same level problems too but when I do get them it's because I was able to break them down.

The San Francisco Bay Area is the metropolitan region surrounding Northern California's San Francisco and San Pablo bays. Home to more than 100 cities that contain in excess of 7 million people combined, it encompasses roughly 7,000 square miles (18,130 square kilometers) [source: What Is the Bay?]. While there is no central governing body that oversees all of the Bay Area's hiking trails, it's safe to say there are thousands of miles of trail here. The San Francisco Bay Trail alone makes a 500 mile (805 kilometer) loop around the bay, while the 335 mile (539 kilometer) Bay Area Ridge Trail, which winds along the ridges towering over the bay, will eventually contain more than 550 miles (885 kilometers) when all segments are connected [source: Bay Area Ridge Trail, Bay Trail].

The biggest piece of advice on writing a meaningful letter about what she does for you as a student, is to not only talk about what was great about her and her teaching (with examples!), but also what impact the class had on you, your understanding of the material, your perspective, your thoughts about your future within the field, other classes, future professions, etc. In my opinion, the strongest and most meaningful praise I have gotten from students has been the praise regarding the "big picture" and the lasting impact I had on students. Those letters give me the strongest warm fuzzies, and are the things that are most helpful to me for retention and tenure reviews.

I alsofound Korean and Taiwanese cuisines very interesting, and it was nice to search the night markets for snacks! Everybody seems to rave about Thai food, but I am not a big fan. I may be a simpleton, but I find it hard to understand what I am eating in Thailand, as most of the dish names are too hard to pronounce/memorise. Some Indian street food is pretty cool, and there nowhere better than Mumbai than to sample the delectable vada pav!

Simple things like if a person keeps looknig at their cards   normally means their hand is not that good   if they had aces   they would remember. However of course they could be pretending they dont have good cards. However, over many games, the best player will win the most tournaments and even a solid player who knows the basics of the game and applies them correctly will make a profit, so it is fundamentally a game of skill. Although I could teach you the basics of the game in a matter of a few minutes it could take years to master the game, if you ever did. There is luck involved. Perhaps you heard the now famous quote from Phil Helmuth "If there was no luck involved I win them all." Maybe he has a point but the luck part of the game is, I think, part of the reason the game is so popular: Even a novice can be a winner. Luck, yes, but to a lesser degree. Skill, a part of the game some never will master.

Kemple Clinic was founded in 1998 by retired dentist and long time Bend resident, Dr. Kemple. Dr. Kemple's mission was to eliminate pediatric oral disease. To this day, Kemple Clinic strives to support that mission by providing free, high quality, on site and offsite dental screenings and preventative education needed to promote the oral health and overall well being of children in our community. By the end of the school year, Kemple will have screened more than 5,000 school children during their School Based Screen and Seal Programs, providing nearly 10,000 parents with a written basic dental screening, reinforcing regular visits to the dentist. Kemple's on site clinic also offers on site hygiene appointments (cleanings, x rays, risk assessments) at the clinic for uninsured, underinsured and/or underserved children in Central Oregon. If, upon assessment, acute dental treatments are necessary, Kemple Clinic works with more than 70 volunteer dentists in Central Oregon to deliver these urgent and critical dental treatment services to at risk children in Central Oregon.

Okay this is all not just coincidences anymore. The shredder company showing up right as Seungri was talking with police was already shady enough, but it could have just been an ill timed coincidence. could have been. But now this? Nah it just is too much that they want us to buy, too much they want us to believe. And why should we believe it? YG is a pathological liar and anyone would have to be completely naive to imagine that he couldn be personally involved here, none the less completely clean of any illegal activity overall. He already lied and said that the texts of Seungri don exist, oya so what does the Anti Corruption commission have in their possession right now Yang? And I don think that Seungri has enough power to have the police in his pocket the way he does by himself, as well as all the other criminal connections. Its far more likely that YG is behind him and that Seungri is working with YG associates.

A close enough approximation to figure out the odds of getting the hand you want is to multiply the number of cards left in the deck that can complete your hand  4 if there are still 2 cards to be drawn, and  2 if there is only one card to be drawn. So, for example, if between the flop and your hand, you have 4 hearts, there are still 9 more hearts in the deck that can give you your flush   which gives you (roughly) 36% chance.

Don't. Only touch your own cards and chips. Other players' chips and cards, discards, board cards, the pot and everything else are off limits. It is customary for the winner of each pot to tip the dealer 50 cents to a dollar, depending on locale and the stakes. Sometimes you will see players tip several dollars for a big pot or an extremely unlikely suck out. Sometimes you will see players stiff the dealer if the pot was tiny or split between two players. If you are the victim of such a mistake, call it out immediately and do not let the game proceed. If your opponent is the victim, let your conscience be your guide; many see no ethical dilemma in remaining silent. If you are not involved in the pot, you must judge the texture of the game to determine whether to speak up. In general, the higher the stakes, the more likely you should keep your mouth shut.

Looking at the farm system there isn much to hope for in 2008, which means were are going to be stuck with more bad Sabean signings. Sure if Barry is gone that frees $18 million dollars but then they sign some has been for $20 million (ex:Benitez, Morris) and then what? The fact that the free agent market forces you to overpay for mediocre talent means that you better have a good farm system. The Giant need to bite the bullet and hire some real talent scouts and rebuild their system from the bottom up. On a bright note, at least all those pitching draft choices are starting to pay off.
