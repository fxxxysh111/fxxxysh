I slept on it and honestly I like the way you played it more. At 100bb I think we could 3b flop and jam most turns, but this deep I don think its a good idea to 3b the third nuts, especially in a spot where the off suit combos of the other two nutted hands are possible. If we compare this to a spot like CO vs BB on a 456r board where we hold 23s on the button and V should not have any combos of 73, and only the suited combos of 78 we could much more reasonably 3b the flop. V would only have 4 combos ahead of us where in the spot were in V could have up to 32 combos ahead of us. I think in reality Q8o doesn always call and KQ sometimes 3bs so its probably closer to half of that but you can see it still a huge difference.

It wasn even an "I believe you". I called out the player who folded the Ace, who confirmed and said something to the effect of "sorry about that, I be more careful in the future".

You want a specific metabolite, its trickier. You have to know everything about what that microorganism currently does with the precursor and intermediates of the pathway already. You have to know if that organism has a mechanism of getting those molecules inside of itself. Then you have to know which enzymes in the pathway are needed to synthesize the metabolite you care about and for each one, repeat the process described above (or find a way to combine them in a single message first).

Blackjack Card counters may enjoy a slight edge in this game, but for those of us just interested in knowing basic strategy we only have a 1 to 2 percent edge against us. The goal of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer by drawing cards from the deck. Cards are added up by the numeric value on their fronts; face cards count as 10 while aces count as one or 11. The house has an edge because the player must act first and will lose if he busts before the dealer does the same.

One evening, I was drinking with friends nearby (as in, line of sight). They kept calling me to come get a massage; I passed on it at first, but then they offered 50% off and twice as long (aka pay for 30 mins, get 2 hours).

Most importantly, talk to them, and really, really listen to them, and let them know that they can and should tell you anything.

There is a probabilistic element to it, yes. But it still doesn explain why matter won out. Let use the coin flipping analogy, because it seems useful here. Say you flipped a coin once, and it comes up heads. Not unexpected. Say you flipped a coin ten times, and it comes up heads 6 times, and tails 4 times. Still not unexpected. Say you flipped it a hundred times, and it comes up heads 60 times, and tails 40 times. Now it starts to get strange. Say you flipped the coin a quintillion times, and you still get significantly more heads. While technically possible, it is extremely unlikely with a fair coin, so the reasonable assumption is that the coin is not fair. Thus, in the same way, we know that there is almost certainly some reason the universe favors matter. We just aren sure why it does.

But why are these notions stronger here than in France? Why is "childhood" not held sacred in the same way and why is it not invested with sexual purity in the same way? The answer for that lies in the Victorian Age, of course. Part of what Victorians did in the US and in England was to create racial hierarchies based on sexual ones. White people were sexually more controlled than racial others, but white women were sexually innocent and pure BECAUSE they were childlike. The conflation of white female purity and childish sexual innocence got tangled up with notions of white superiority over "those people" whose children had sex and women were promiscuous. This was at the center of the drawing of the color line in the US, but it was also at the center of Empire in England.

Granted that the present political conjuncture, in which the Democratic Party controls the presidency and Senate, and the Republican Party, the House of Representatives, creates the possibility for gridlock.

However, having experienced those things, I was specifically vetting against it. Also because I had had those experiences, I did not weigh sex in as high of a regard as others might.

Together we fought, working out way through many adventures, until we had toppled the Tyrant King himself, and set the whole Empire free. Or at least so we had thought. With the leader of the country usurped, the world was left in a state of Chaos, one in which the Guild stepped up to the plate. My friends, recognized for their good work, were instated, along with Atlas, as one of the major players in the Guild, becoming world leaders, practically overnight. With my goal behind me, and that rage, slowly fading away, day by day, I slipped away, finding myself a nice quiet place, away from everyone and everything else. I still kept up to date with the news, of course, but my name wasn't remembered the way that theirs had been. I had the luxury of a nice quiet life, and I had given up my dream, for a second chance. All of my friends, had seemingly forgotten about me, just like all the rest, and a part of me was fine with that. They all had lives to live, and with so much life in them, it was only natural that people would gravitate to them. I was never really quite that way. I stayed to myself, and fought out of necessity, not enjoyment.

My suggestion that we avoid the term elderlyin medicine goes beyond the word itself to encompass all that it connotes: stereotypes, unwarranted impressions, and bias. This is essentially a human rights issue. Medicine is the science and art of individualised communication, evaluation, recommendation, and treatment. Each patient has the right to be treated as an individual, according to medical standards based on their specific age, general condition, and comorbidities. To label everyone above a certain age as elderly and to treat them identically defies this principle, which should be at the heart of medicine.

Ultimately, I got into education because I wanted to help people through music. As a teacher, all the bureaucratic red tape made me feel like I couldn do that. As a music therapist, I like that my main priority is to get to know and help my clients. I like that the things that I assess now are how my clients are reaching their goals instead of whether they memorized something for a test, or played the right note at the right time. There still red tape, there are still workplace issues, but overall, I happy with my choice.

Our bathing and hair washing routines are based on a strange system of depleting the skin and hair of their natural oils by lathering up with soap and shampoo and then replenishing them with moisturizers and conditioners. We carry out this (usually) daily ritual for a couple of reasons: By Western standards, the appearance of oily, unwashed hair is generally unacceptable   and it just feels kind of gross to go without a bath or shower for more than a couple of days. Secondly, these natural oils can lead skin conditions like acne vulgaris, where sebum becomes backed up in the hair follicles, creating a smorgasbord for bacteria, which break the fats into fatty acids. These create an allergic reaction that presents itself as acne.

Everyone is different, I fall into the small category of people that require a minimal amount of social interaction to be happy and don feel any need to "make my mark on the world" or accomplish great things in order to feel fulfilled. You may not fall into this category however, because you stated that you have a nagging feeling that you are wasting time. That shows that you want to still accomplish things. You really need to take a look at yourself and figure out what kind of life you want to build for yourself and what would actually make you happy. If that being an active part of the community or working your way up the corporate ladder that fine, if it sitting around doing nothing constructive but having fun by yourself that also fine. That why I love FIRE, it allows you to do what you want with your time once you reach it.

I was told in the early 80s that home economics was not a marketable skill. Do we only need to teach what can be turned into a career? Many years later I had a job in the new, updated home ec field called Family and Consumer Sciences where I taught a class called "Livjng on Your Own" which was fun and the kids really seemed to enjoy it. They learned the true cost of owning a car and the pitfalls of bad credit. There is a lot of urging for those skills to be mandatorily taught in high school but we may need for the next reversal of thought in education to see that happen.

Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam   famous for "Bowling Alone," his 2000 book on declining civic engagement   has found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.

The fact that busting out means you lose all of your equity in the prize pool, while doubling up does not double your equity, means that to play for a lot of chips early on, you need to have a big advantage. In Texas hold'em sit and go tournaments such opportunities come up fairly often, such as with having a big pair preflop, or hitting a set on the flop, making a flush, etc. But in Omaha SNG's most hands are only about a 6:5 favorite preflop and even after a favorable flop for your hand has hit your opponents will usually be drawing very live. The result is that you should play very tight early on, even tighter than in hold'em sng tournaments, waiting for only the most absolute premium hands like a pair of aces with a wheel card, or A23x. This can be quite boring and would be easy to take advantage of in a cash game, but is the correct Omaha sng strategy.
