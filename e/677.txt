As played, flop is fine. Turn should probably be a x/r at some frequency but call isn bad. I think this is likely a fold to any value sized river bet.

I do appreciate the honest feedback. This is something the other mods and I have talked about a fair bit. There a little risk of throwing out the baby with the bathwater with our approach, but in a place like reddit, there so much bathwater from lonely young men. That was a weird metaphor, but you get the idea  in order to get rid of the really bad comments, we sometimes have to get rid of some decent ones too. We have to draw the line somewhere and so far, although our approach isn popular with everyone (although it is with most), it does seem to be working.

For the record, after seeing this sub, I can actually sympathize with why some people would cheat. Like some guy here (marriedscoundrel?) who doesn get any from his wife, explained it to her, and she shot him down. At that point, why the fuck shouldn he cheat? Who is being more selfish in that relationship? Can you even measure selfishness? The dude wants some action, his wife doesn want to put out. What is he supposed to do? Wallow in his misery and touch his dick for the rest of his life? The bullshit fairytale solution is to go to therapy and talk it out and his wife will magically want his dick again. But that not how reality works. Whats next? Is divorce really  the  option when the end result is a catastrophe for everyone involved?

In other words, monsters will have more hit points, higher armor class, more powerful and varied attacks, different tactics, etc. 
And you did the same thing but pointing out abuse as if I as a man completely disregard that as truth or support it.

Math doesn back you up on this opinion.I think maybe you don have very much life experience yet based on this comment.Hammocknapping  9 points  submitted 9 days agoIt irritates me to no end that you believe women were staying at home en mass to raise their children prior to the "modern" era (I'm assuming you're referring to pre WWII), because it is simply not true. In reality, this idyllic picture you have in your head of the simple life was limited to securely middle class, white women.Women in the lower classes were already working outside of the homes.

These days there are all kinds of hydrotherapy treatments you can experience, and you don't need to travel to remote hot springs to get them. Hydrotherapy spa treatments have come a long way. Some treatments work in tandem, like steam baths followed by quick plunges in cold water. This process is repeated and is supposed to help with the body's internal balance. Underwater massage therapy is popular as well. For this process, you relax in a warm tub while water is applied with a hose at various pressures to sore muscles. You can also get a good old fashioned head, neck and scalp massage while soaking in a hot tub. This can be applied along with aromatherapy treatments for maximum relaxation.

Planning Ahead Some Caribbean islands offer no gambling at all. On those that do, the casinos may be in only one city or may be in a number of locations. If having access to a gambling casino is important to you, plan carefully in advance to ensure that your island destination has all the features and amenities you're looking for. Visitors who plan to spend a good part of their vacation in the casino would be well advised to book themselves into a hotel or resort that either has an on site casino or is located close to one.

Well, more realistically, the word "poker" probably finds its origins in the underworld of thieves. Some of the card hustlers may have already been using the expression since "poke" was a slang word used by pickpockets. It is believed that card hustlers, who emerged from that same underworld to cheat unsuspecting opponents, used the word in relation to their card playing victims.

Fast forward to yesterday massage, I made a same day evening appointment for 45 minutes with him again since I was feeling extremely tense. When I walked in and he greeted me, it seemed like he was staring at my breasts, but I didn think anything of it since I wasn wearing anything revealing/form fitting. He an older man, so I chalked it up to a lazy eye sort of thing (and maybe it truly was). We got to the massage   he did my neck/shoulders/lower back from the back, and when I turned to face up, he did my neck/shoulders from the front. He also did my pecs again when I pointed to the spot of tension near my armpit. He then offered to massage my sternum again, and I think he still had me draped at that point but I definitely felt like one or both of my breasts were being exposed slightly from beneath the sheets. Again, I thought I was just imagining it and didn want to awkwardly open my eyes to check since he was right above me. Now I think he was just testing the waters to see if I would react, because he then proceeded to remove the sheets completely without asking me and left my breasts and stomach completely exposed. Only my panties and down were draped.

A huge number of man caves seem to fall into the sports fan category. If you have any kind of sports memorabilia at all, it's probably rotting in a box somewhere if you don't have a man cave to display it in. Where else are you going to put it   the living room? The master bedroom? We think not. The man cave is your chance to rescue your posters, jerseys and sports equipment from storage and put them where they belong, on prominent display. You can do a generic sports theme, of course, but a shrine to a specific team (or at least city) is really the best way to show your stuff.

Starting OverIn science a theory is not the same as in common usage (ie, 'an unproved assumption'), but is an explanation of observable phenomena which has been tested and not found to be wrong, yet. Before a theory is accepted by the scientific community, the research should be duplicated by someone independent of the group or individual doing the original work.

One of the benefits of flying on such a large plane is that you cannot feel any mild turbulence. The plane is simply too big and too bulky to be bothered by a bitof wind so your journey should always be a smooth one on the A380. The sheer scale of the Airbus A380 allows for the airlines flying it to customise it to their own desire.

I play a mix of online and live 1/2. Something you will definitely have to get used to is the pace of live play. Live plays so much slower than online and without the option of playing 6 max it feels even slower. That being said live is softer than 1cent 2 cent from my experience, I only play at night on the weekends when it is really soft. I would suggest playing tighter than you do online. Even at the lowest stakes online it is rare to see a pot get raised and have all the players come along, in live 1/2 this is almost standard. My strategy has been to bet big preflop with premium hands and try to get in cheaply with suited connectors and medium pocket pairs. I have consistently raised to 15 dollars preflop with Aces and gotten at least one caller sometimes 2. If they make top pair they usually won lay down their hand to continued aggression as well. If your pocket pair or suited connector hits start betting big for value especially if the pot is multiway or if you think the board might hit the villain range in any way again the biggest leak is in 1/2 is not being able to get away from a made hand. Now you should be aware that there will most likely be at least one or two good players at the table with you. But these players are easy to spot, if you get in a pot heads up with them don be afraid to actually play cards with them. But with the usual 1/2 player, you can play your hands very straightforwardly and still make a profit.

The year 2015 marked a defining moment for the health of women, children, and adolescents. It is the end point of the United Nations' millennium development goals, and their transition to the sustainable development goals. It was also the 20th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development's plan of action and the Beijing Declaration and platform of actionAlthough great strides have been made in reducing maternal and child mortality, showing that change is possible, many countries are lagging behind in reaching millennium development goal 4 (to reduce the under 5 mortality rate by two thirds between 1990 and 2015) and goal 5 (to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015 and achieve universal access to reproductive healthcare by 2015), and there are vast inequities between and within countries. In 2010, confronted with unacceptably high rates of maternal and child mortality, the UN secretary general called on the world to develop a strategy to improve maternal and child health in the world's poorest and high burden countries, starting with 49 low income countries. The articles in this collection examine the evidence and the thinking that form the basis of the new global strategyWe know what needs to be done, say Marleen Temmerman and colleagues, but we need to push hard now to create a world in which every women, every child, and every adolescent is able to survive, thrive, and transformWomen's health priorities and interventions

Long Complaint: My mother in law can't be trusted to provide Christmas dinner anymore. Last year and this year the only food she offered for her self proclaimed "feast" was meatballs and Italian sausages in red sauce served from a crockpot, with roasted potatoes. No vegetables, no salad, no other side dishes. (And the food doesn't even taste good.) There are two people in our family that have been vegetarians for YEARS and the only food offered to them was potatoes. I would have cried if I drove for over 3 hours and the only thing I could eat for Christmas dinner was a potato. Members of the family have tried to help her with dinner by offering to bring a dish, but she refuses help by saying "oh no, dinner's taken care of, we have plenty of food". And she won't tell you what's for dinner, so you can't know what kind of dish to bring on your own. This year I brought an appetizer so I would know I had at least one edible dish that night, and I'm glad I did. My poor sister in law, who only had a potato for dinner, and I decided next year we're just bringing our own food because this shit is getting ridiculous.

I've volunteered some time on two different goat farms and goats are really neat animals. On one farm, the milk producing females would even line up to be milked in order of oldest to youngest. They weren't trained to do this, that's just what they chose to do. And the kids are adorable when they're all gathered around the milk bucket. 9 of them will drain a 5 gallon bucket in about 45 seconds. Some of the adults would even let you leash them up and take them for a walk, just watch out for the horns.

Common sense should prevail but sometimes it never does which is why we have laws that seem so comical. It is because people have forgotten common sense and humanity.

You could probably eat the same things, just with smaller portions and you see similar results.

Yeah, it's a very difficult topic. It sounds counter intuitive but the bullfighting breed of cattle actually lives one of the most "free in the wild" kind of life. Only a small percentage actually get to a bullfighting ring (I think it was 1/6, 1/60, don't remember honestly), while most of them (all the females to begin with) never do, and they live a very free and open range kind of life, secluded from contact with humans and living very well. Compared to industry breeding of cattle for meat and milk, they truly live a privileged life. And in places where bullfighting is banned, well guess what happens to all those animals, straight to the slaughterhouse.

They said he could come home, and after several months he still hadn said a word. I heard him up late working in the garage one night on something, so I sneaked in to see what it was. He was engraving words on a piece of wood. I got closer and closer to see what it said, and when I could finally make out a sentence or 2, he heard me coming. It surprised him, and he spun around and said, "Don you ever sneak up on me like that again, you little bastard!" Then he grabbed some jumper cables and proceeded to beat the living shit out of me.

One final thing: I was humbled by how not good at massage I was going into my education. Intuitive knowledge is great and can really aid in healing. Technical knowledge is also great.

That makes a difference as to what you can legally practice.

Concealment. Concealment has nothing to do with accelerating the healing of your love bruise. But, it can help you avoid the taunts and teases of friends and colleagues.

Sometimes, you can also get away with a concealer. Just apply the right amount of concealer on your bruise. Other people have tried sticking band aid over the bruises, and use the "I have an infected pimple" excuse for prying colleagues.

Nor was there some codified religious scripture despite the fact that druids seem to have existed as some interregional religious political order between Gaul, Britain and Ireland (Caesar mentions the institution of druids was invented in Britain and spread to Gaul, and that some Gaulish druids would travel there to receive instruction).

The trick is for each of us to learn to use both energies so that one energy can mitigate the other, preventing neither from getting out of whack. To play all the cards in our hand we have to start by understanding the power of both energies. We also need to be aware of our natural inclination   where we feel the most comfortable. That's the first Stilletto Step of Self Awareness. Then it's important to take the second Stilletto Step and accept the characteristics of each energy without labeling one "right" and the other "wrong." By accepting that both have value, we can consciously "try the other energy on for size." Just like at the poker table, changing your pattern of raises and bets increases the opportunities for the cards in your hand.
