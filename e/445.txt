2 most likely reasons why solvers dont overbet flops are that on the flop ranges are most often at their widest meaning there is alot of mergy stuff for both players. This means solver cant build a balanced overbetting strategy bc it loses ev trying to balance out ur strong overbetting range. Second reason is that stacks are only 100bb so early overbetting often commits ur opponent to the pot meaning his future decisions become more clear and ur options become worse..

Okay well I think we just talking about ninja here. I see your argument, but comparing ninja to xQc is laughable. They are very very different personalities on twitch. Ninjas "toxicity" is far more infrequent and mild. For xQc that is his image and one of the big draws to his stream (a lot of people who likes to watch him rage, not saying the majority but lots). Ninjas biggest draw is his skill in fortnite, I don think there are many people who watch him for his infrequent salt after a death. If they did they would be pretty disappointed I think.

On the other hand, she has become one of the top four of this season's drag race. She has to learn to get herself out there and 'become' a bit extroverted with other queens. I've recently become aware of how my actions might paint me as acting high and mighty when it totally is not that way. I know this is caused by a lot of self hatred and doubt within myself. I've started to become more open and sociable. I'll say hello to coworkers in passing, make small conversation, begin interactions with other people and it's working out well for me. Although it takes a lot out of me to do these small gestures, I know in the end it's to my benefit. Kameron has to go out and put herself out there a bit more.

Snyder told The Daily Beast that the Florida massage parlors were part of a $20 million China based sex trafficking operation, and they saw several men moving women between massage parlors. A female sex slave told his investigators that man who was moving her around had a gun, and indicated that he would use it, Snyder continued, adding that the men threatened the women not to leave the spas. did get a sense that some of these men may have had these women as investments, Snyder said.

Whether or not you're a fan of Nancy Meyers, there is one undeniable thread to her work: she makes compassionate films about men and women feeling vulnerable and, even more so, men and women feeling vulnerable out loud and with one another. There is a reason that she, similar to the late Nora Ephron, has come to be synonymous with a category of filmmaking historically associated with female audiences: she paints the women and men of her films with the same brush, however broad. She makes space for stories that centre women (albeit, mostly white women) and the ways in which their feelings and experiences shape their relationships with men   and, importantly, other women   around them..

By law, the Manitoba government must now maintain a public listing of all regulatory requirements and where to find them. For every new regulation, government departments have to consult with the public and other governments to ensure we actually understand the impact of the new rules before they are enacted.

With the constant onslaught of advertising for the next great piece of exercise equipment, it can be difficult to determine what is worth buying and what will be added to your collection of unused equipment.

1. ROULETTE. You might be a speculator. When I play Roulette, I have a difficult time stopping. I know my favorite number (23) absolutely HAS TO be landing on the next spin. I can't stop now and miss out on the big winning! I know that the game is luck, that I have no control over the outcome, that I'm completely passive in determining the outcome. BLACKJACK. You love math. You love analyzing the situation. You know when to split, when to double down. You don't care if the player next to you misplays their hand. You have a specific betting system that you religiously employ. You are methodical. CRAPS. You love fast paced excitement. You want to do deals, you want things to happen now. You love the rush of the negotiation, the chance to make it big (or go home with nothing). So, do you bet the No Pass which has slightly better odds than the Pass but draws the ire of the person standing next to you who thinks you bring negative vibes to the table? Or, do you not care about what others think?

Investing in your health is one of the top priorities of most people nowadays. Many people spend a lot of money just to ensure that they are at their optimum health status. Aside from the regular diet, a number of people are relying on the benefits of going to the gym. One of the internationally known health clubs is Gold's Gym. All of the gym's fitness centers are equipped with various exercise equipment and personal trainers to assist every client that comes in their doors.
I call it uncritical because people do use these opportunities to streamline their morals and stance in order to create a deeper sense of self, that which I am not. Whether it sexual deviancy, tax aversion, whatever else one can use as a foil.

The nice thing about having disposable income (no kids, a house that's paid off, and a well paying job) is that you can make a weekly trip to the bagel deli and get fruit, veggies, bagels, all protein I could carry, and what felt like 100 pounds of so that I could feed the whole class.

But make sure by checking on some local poker community of yours. As for live poker, tournaments are legal, but as for cash games   it differs from country to country as well. (Full Answer). 
Continuing the above example, you call the bet on the flop, increasing the pot to $10. The turn card is 8, which does not improve your hand. You still have the same number of outs, 14, but one less unseen card, 46. Notice that your pot odds are almost the same, roughly 2.3 to 1. The first player bets $2, making the pot $12, and the other two players fold. The bet you must now call is $2 into a $12 dollar pot. This reduces down to 6 to 1 odds (12 divided by 2 equals 6, and 2 divided by 2 equals 1). Once again the correct play is to call. Notice that at this time, if you don't improve on the river, you can fold, and if you do improve, you can bet or raise.
