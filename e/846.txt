With this game being positional, if you are a dealer you would be the last to act and you can take the pot of the blinds fold. A raise is going to make the blinds fold if they are in a medium position; however, if you are going to call, they may just check to see what comes up next. 
Left Alive Is A Fascinating Concept, But A Crappy GameLeft Alive, the new game by Square Enix, sounds amazing. It mixes intense sneaking and massive robot battles, and if that doesn't sound familiar enough, it even has art from Metal Gear's Yoji Shinkawa to drive the point home. But the reality is less impressive than the concept. Left Alive is a clunky disaster whose good ideas are undercut by horrible gameplay. It's hard to know where to even begin talking about Left Alive, which is out now for PC and Playstation 4. Conceptually, it's exactly the sort of game I'd want to play.

Rather, I suggest taking a bullet train to Busan. 
Sure variance matters since I want to know how likely I am to loose my entire roll, but it obvious on its face that it easier to go bust in a game with uncapped betting than one with a cap. CV is what players are really talking about when they talk about swinginess (how likely is it that I go on a sustained downswing where I continue to lose despite my edge?). You can really play loose aggressive in limit holdem, so everyone plays tight, but a tight player has more variance in limit holdem than no limit imo. A limit player is going to get forced into a lot of large pots due to drawing hands with barely enough pot odds to call and lose most of them, while a no limit player can play hands with high equity preflop and flop to reduce variance.

That my issue I would like different. Hypothetical Example: I go on Camping Trip A, have my gear list. Another few weeks I want to go on Camping Trip B and I duplicate my list from Trip A. However I made some small tweaks and I like to change my list accordingly. My "food" is only 18oz on Trip B instead of 30oz on Trip A. Also I found some tags made of lead I overlooked on 3 pieces of gear and trimmed an ounce off each so I need to update those. Finally I cut 2oz off of my pack due to straps. I want to make those changes and not have Trip A be impacted. In an ideal world, Trip A can be locked and nothing can ever be altered on it by anything I do unless I manually unlock it.

Being a millionaire gives you the option to do what you want, when you want, and where you want. It also gives you responsibility.

You can't just take a four week vacation unless you've really structured your business in a way where it can be self sufficient without your presence, which is hard to do.

I had an Elite Manchurian fan for a couple years now which I really enjoy. I been meaning to order some knots from Maseto to try but haven yet. The Elite knot and Mozingo knot are similar in face feel though the Mozingo knot is much less scrubby. No scritch detected in either. I have the Elite knot set at around 48mm loft so it has slightly more backbone but the Mozingo knot isn floppy at all. The Mozingo knot really tickles my fancy because of it distinct fan shape. It very visually appealing. I really enjoy Maggard knots personally because they inexpensive and high quality. They tend to be the scrubbiest of the bunch but you can beat the value.

The prime example of such reactions occurs in the interior of stars, where temperatures are of the order of 20 million degrees Centigrade.

First, therapy. Non optional. You need it if you're ever going to overcome this. Second, get the fuck off of reddit because the teenagers and 20 something know it all's are not equipped to advise you on any of this. As you can see, most wont bother to read before they start typing. The climate in the relationship subs are generally anti men and they tend to have real gender biases (like the guy saying that it's justified for women to cheat if their husbands don't have sex with them), so they will latch on to anything they can to berate you with rather than focus on giving real advice. You need to delete all of your social media (yes, especially reddit!) and seek out a counselor immediately. remember how I said husband controls the finances? That can be a double edged sword. If you want practically anything, you'll have to ask your husband and since he controls it, he'll always have the final say! Want more clothes? Too bad, your husband won't buy it for you

Like you, Dad was abusive (told the 11yr old daughter "you so fat cuz mommy feeds you crap. you got to exercise." and then later that day, "do you want to go get mc donalds?". He was just as bad to his 6yr old son1. Called him a Poof because he wanted his nails painted like mom goth friends. He also had effeminate mannerisms and dad drilled him on it. I feel terrible for not standing up to him but I was just a kid, too2). In my case, the mom was just neglectful, left the kids with her rag tag group of teenager friends and didn give them the time/care they deserved. The last time I saw them was 2002 and I think about them all the time. I still have the art they drew and gifts they gave me. I WISH so hard that the parents joint hatred of me after the breakup would have been less than their hatred for each other, they made sure the kids never got in touch with me. I sure they would have. Through social media I know believe the daughter struggled with her weight forever, she was depressed suicidal, eventually she found a girlfriend and moved to China from Canada. The Son1 transitioned to female and moved to the Northwest territories best as I can tell. I just glad they far from their evil, fucked up parents.
