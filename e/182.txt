Most internet browsers have an mode (on Chrome you select File, New Incognito Window) where your browser history will not be saved, so even if your parents go through your browser history they won be able to see it. Plus most UK brands will ship to Portugal.. 
Tournaments: I have two $700 profit tournaments (one in July, one last week) that coerced me into going hard into this tournament series over the last week. I don think I a bad tourney player, but the last week has felt pretty substandard in terms of starting hand distribution and flop hit %. Over all of my $350 entry tournaments I pretty sure I was only dealt AA once and when I open raised preflop EP everyone folded, and both times I was dealt KK there was an A on flop, multiway.
I so donated.

McCain bet, if it worked, had several clear political upsides: It would showcase him as 1) a leader, 2) the candidates with the experience to get things done, and 3) a man who put first. If he lost the bet, McCain risked 1) being identified with a massive unpopular federal spending program, 2) being seen as political show boater who inserted politics into an otherwise orderly process and 3) a candidate who would rather not debate Barack Obama. A big bet, indeed, and voters would decide the winner..

I used to sleep walk. I'm only inferring that this happened but one night I was sleep walking and went into my parents room when they were trying to make my sister a middle child. Next morning my mom asked "hey did you see anything last night when you walked into our room" and I said "I walked into your room last night?" and she sighed in relief saying "oh thank god." I was 8 and didn't know what sex was so I brushed it off. Wasn't until years later when I connected the dots and realized what probably happened.

You be surprised. I had a pretty sick little girl that needed to go back every 2 weeks for about 2 months and all in all, with the deworming, fecal samples, follow ups, it didn cost more than like $250 USD.

Fishing is meant to supplement your food supply without needing a lot of people for it. A single person can fully fish 3 water sections. If you need to fish far away, consider placing a hut, a totem, etc so they don needlessly run back to town after just a couple fish.. 
I don't know what they are planning. Maybe they are going to be great tenants, or maybe they will have loud parties, not mow the grass, make their neighbors hate them, park 6 cars in the street and leave your house a wreck. My suggestion is to run and don't look back..

Economically, after being suffocated for 16 months by China's "doghouse diplomacy", many South Korean businesses were left gasping for air. Korea has no bargaining power or leverage when it comes to China pollution. And it only going to get worse as China moves 20,000 factories to the coast so that the pollution blows right into Korea instead of over Chinese land.

But one invention changed all that overnight and made slavery suddenly really profitable, it was the Cotton Gin. Prior to the Cotton Gin it was a giant pain to harvest cotton. The cotton was heavily protected by the plant, getting the cotton out often left one hands bleeding, cotton was considered more trouble then it was worth to grow. But then thanks to the cotton gin you could dump all your freshly harvested cotton into a machine, and have 1 slave spin a lever to break the cotton out pain free. 1 slave could do the work of dozens all of a sudden. This is why cotton was king in the south.
It may not help pain but it does help me break free of a mental prison, the feeling of being worthless because I'm disabled from events outside of my control, I do wish it had that effect for everyone, but for some it just makes it worse, locks them down into a state of panic and anxiety.. 
Don think the Founding Fathers wanted the right to bear arms to become the right to build an arsenal in your home. Have chased 1,000 leads and examined Paddock politics, finances, any possible radicalization and his social behaviour typical investigative avenues that have helped uncover the motive in past shootings. 
That is to me a better way of calculating it. Let say you flop a flush draw and you think your opponent has an over pair to the board.

She makes heart bracelets. I was looking at those and started digging through pictures. We made those in home ec as well. We made a ton of heart stuff in February. We made heart scarves, heart necklaces, heart cookies, heart cakes, heart hats, heart mittens, heart bears, and anything else our teacher could think of. We even had a special Valentine Day party we had to set the table for. Seeing some of these items just brings back a flood of memories from my childhood. From the Aqua Net to the music. It brings back something to make me smile. I wish my kids could experience school like I had. Today we have too much common core and not enough learning about life. Home ec taught us plenty that we can use today. I am so grateful I got that experience!
We just keep hoping that our elected officials do their job, which is to speak for us. I don't get it. We elected them to fight for us.

I doubt the millions part as well. However, I do remember that a lot of schools in the US watched the broadcast live due to the presence of Christa McAuliffe on the shuttle and her affiliation with NASA Teacher in Space Project.

There are a few specialty lingerie shops here that stock size 6/28 bands, however the ones I know of start at D cups, which doesn't help you much. You could contact Brava and see if they're willing/ able to order in some 6Cs for you. They normally only stock D+ cups, but I've never tried asking for a smaller size.
I still think that putting pressure on the AG over the prosecution decision was wrong. Howard Anglin suggests instituting what called a "Shawcross exercise" in the UK: it a formal way for the AG to canvass the rest of government to provide their input (are there any public interest considerations?) in written form.

Poker is nowhere different from traditional games. 
A few of the core principles I learned really opened up my eyes and allowed me to start winning, but it took time to implement them correctly for MTTs, especially low stake ones. Upswing is too in depth for low stake play most of the time. When players think sec0nd pair low kicker is worth shoving 25 big blinds it hard to bluff as frequently as they say you should.

E: /u/dellett makes a good point that Gideon Bible do differ slightly from normal bibles   at the beginning they feature a list of sections to turn to that offer encouragement in troubling times. Along with that, some folks have been asking for proof that it does lower suicide rates. I can say for certain it does, but I can point to This Study on if Religion lowers Suicide Rates that concludes "They do in the US and Russia, but it increases them elsewhere." Why Russia and the US are outliers is a great question, and some theorize that it not them, but Christianity that the outlier, since Christianity is the dominant religion in both counties. I don know if it actually lowers rates but. Again, we get the bibles free, so if the possibility exists, there no harm in trying.

The amateur pro loves to play draws, even things like unsuited one gap shit out of position. They probably read somewhere in a poker book that they shouldn do this, but they also read the section on implied odds and badly misunderstood it. They usually mentally overestimate their pot odds (or don bother estimating them at all) and will call 3/4 to pot sized bets with gut shots, etc. Adjust by playing a bit tighter and extracting max value from them on the first two streets. If you in position and they check to you after a potential draw hits on the river, you usually should check back. They will often check raise either to slow play the big hand or attempt a bluff with air. If you have top pair or similar, save yourself the tough spot by just checking back, content with your max value on the first two streets.

This year, we present a new and improved Ad Age Best Places to Work 2019, designed with our new partner, Latitude Research, to create a process allowing organizations of any size from companies/agencies with just 10 employees to those with 1,000 plus an opportunity to compete. Better yet, we built the new foundation on the key factors employees most value today. Most important to employees overall: benefits, like fair pay, health insurance and PTO. Less important: Well, employers who think ping pong tables and free snacks are their biggest draws should think again. Employees love their fun time, but relative to other essentials, those perks matter less.
When designing a new poker chip the best manufacturers create fictitious casinos to help bring authenticity to the other aspects of the poker chip sets. One such popular style of Poker Chip Sets is called "Bluff Canyon Casino". This clay composite Poker Chip comes in several count sets and either a wooden carousel for the lower counts or an aluminum case for the higher count sets. These chips come in various denominations. The Bluff Canyon inlay is set upon a Greek Key molded poker chip. These chips have twelve thin stripes in bunches of three for its edge markings. The layout of this chip is similar to the wildly popular Venetian Poker room casino chip. The inlay itself uses a group of evergreen trees as its fictitious logo, but conveys a rugged outdoor's theme. The fictitious casino destination "Bluff Canyon Casino" is written on top of each chip. The denomination is large and placed near the bottom of the inlay.

No wonder Mrs. Kent stole all that money for her wedding. she would not have been worthy of a happily ever after. although her crimes cost her a couple of years of her life, her whiteness and therefore supposedly virtuous motherhood protected her as well. is impossible to imagine a judge taking pity on a non white bride who stole a small fortune for her wedding. a woman would not be a "mum" but a bridezilla, an intruder on the sacred whiteness that is the bride. would also not be a mum who was needed around her kids, but a bad mother, a threat to her young, since perfect motherhood, like the perfect bride, is also always about the role of white femininity in shoring up white privilege more generally.
By "benefit" I mean that it won hit us as hard relative to the rest of the US/world.

Moreover, since Japan public debt is well over 200% of its GDP the highest among OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development) nations the costs for servicing the debt will skyrocket as interest rates rise. The interest rate goes from 50 basis points to 3% to 4%, that means they may have to come up with an additional 6% or 7% of GDP to pay debt forward, Allen points out. That would create a significant fiscal problem.

When that person dies, the whole cluster dies, too, vanishes from the living memory. I wonder who that person will be for me. Whose death will make me truly dead?"

For nearly two decades, Colin Steer wondered why his living room floor dipped a little near the sofa. We all have that spot in our house   that weird bump by the bathroom, the divot in the kitchen   and we never really thought to question what that's all about. Well, a few years ago, Colin Steer found the answer. While replacing floor joists, Steer discovered a dirt filled brick shaft underneath his home in Plymouth, England. Curious, he dug down about a foot, but his wife made him fill the hole back in, since he was, you know, digging a mysterious hole into the earth through their living room.

I think you want to check your option preflop, you don want to bloat pots out of position, especially with marginal hands like this one and maniac villains behind you who can put you in tough spots. as played, I think flop is an easy fold, you really only hoping to hit an A or 7 and even then any extra equity you pick up on the turn is gonna end up getting you in trouble more often than not. as played I don hate the turn call because if you do realize your 25% equity it a pretty sizeable pot you be dragging. but really you put yourself in a difficult position with your preflop and flop play. against villains like V1 you want to play in position as often as possible and only bloat pots OOP with strong holdings.

They can live in their bubble and never be challenged by the realities of what they want to do.

River is interesting because it makes it so we lack a lot of natural bluffs. I probably significantly under bluffing this river due to incompetence. Hearts make really bad bluffs because they block folds, and all our premium bluffs just made a straight or a pair. I think I actually making some mistakes on the turn by not barreling combos that would be good river bluff candidates on this card specifically. Seems like we probably need to go back and add some J9s, Q9s in order to barrel the J and Q rivers effectively. I pretty much just thinking out loud lol. I dont mind your bet size but I think something slightly larger would be more optimal. Straights are likely close between over bet and bet 70%. PIO does prefer a jam but the population is for sure over folding and you have two cards you really want your opponent to have. As an exploitative adjustment, based on your lack of history with this guy I might just pot river to squeeze a bit more value and not worry about him figuring out some crazy secret to your bet sizing schemes.

In my opinion, it actually makes more sense to pick up ZEC now, while inflation is high and there are more coins being released onto the market (resulting in lower price) as opposed to further down the road where halving will release less coins and put upwards pressure on price.Carbohydrates can be used as a performance enhancing drug though.

The plan, which proponents hope to revive in the session next year, is seen as an expansion of gambling and faces opposition from gambling opponents and other competitors.The "decoupling" movement has created an odd alliance between racetrack casino operators, who see the races as a burden, and animal rights groups out to end greyhound racing altogether, much as they succeeded in outlawing cockfighting several years ago. The animal rights groups say the races and the training are cruel and say some dogs that were poor racers have been euthanized."When decoupling passes, it will lead to a slow and gradual end" of the industry, said Carey Theil, executive director of the anti racing group Grey2K USA.Dog racing's troubles also could be a preview of things to come for the horse racing industry, which in some states has identical laws tying it to casino gambling. 
It's just the latest sally in the ongoing debate over poker that's been raging for more than 150 years. And it comes on the heels of a ruling last year by the Justice Department that 1962s Wire Act applied only to sports betting, not poker. This is kind of ironic, since the Justice Department also shut down online poker in the spring of 2011, charging the men behind the three most popular online sites with fraud and money laundering.
A larger problem lay in dealing with the loyal Mohammedan troopers, who would surely not have stood by in silence as justice was meted out upon their rebellious co religionists. As fortune would have it, the 1st of August was the anniversary of the great Mohammedan festival of Bukra Eid. A capital excuse was thus afforded to permit the Mohammedan horsemen to return to their homes to celebrate, while we Christians, unembarrassed by their presence and aided by the faithful Sikhs, might perform a ceremonial sacrifice of a different nature upon their brethren..

Some of the people replying not understanding how you couldn "just reply back" or "you an immature brat" have clearly NO IDEA what it like when your own parents are damaging and abusive. Just because some people have good relationships with their parents, doesn make it impossible that there are parents who will mistreat and abuse their children like no tomorrow. Lots of projection coming from people who can even imagine what it like to be a child of abuse at your own family hand. No empathy from them because lots of people believe blindly in the narrative of parents are not perfect but inherently always love their kids. That not always the case, and just because they haven experienced it doesn give them the right to berate you for something they don understand. You are doing the right thing for you and enforcing boundaries.

Yes, it's absolutely biased. The article's merit isn't in its ability to make sure it balances mean things said about Shapiro with nice things. It's merit lies in the arguments, logic, and FACTS sites throughout. Furthermore, if bias is something that allows a conscious observer to immediately dismiss an article, literally everything Shapiro has ever touched is immediately dismissible.

Prescription drugs, dental work and eyeglasses are among the allowable medical expenses listed on the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website.

Also no company should have a security flaw which is still being actively exploited 30 days after they were made aware of the problem. Software patches take time and investigations need to happen but all starts with pulling the insecure systems off the internet and leaving them disconnected until the issue is resolved. The only justification for leaving those systems online are if they are critical such as the software you find in some medical equipment (which can still often be disconnected or cut off from the internet at large) or cases involving major internet infrastructure.

She started an argument with a much younger girl saying that the younger girl kept bumping against her arm. I thought this was funny as personal space is something you kind of have to give up when using public transportation, especially during rush hours in Korea.Anyway the younger girl was kind of incredulous at the verbal abuse she was getting and started shouting back getting the attention of the whole carriage. 
In an effort to NOT shoot anyone, I have vowed to spend the rest of the day NOT thinking of the greed and corruption at AIG and in Washington. Instead, I am attempting to visualize pink ponies. Pink ponies lead to pink unicorns, which immediately brings to mind the rather brilliant viral youtube video, "Gay Unicorn Planet." "Gay Unicorn Planet" automatically leads me to gay marriage, which forces my imagination to move from the dirty, no good corridors of big business to the much cleaner halls of the Vermont legislature in Montpelier, where gay marriage is being considered today.

It reminds me of the challenge to California death penalty. The argument hinged on death being a "cruel and unusual punishment" violating the 8th amendment. The judge ruled saying to something to the effect of "Death is most certainly a cruel punishment, but in this courts opinion it is not unusual, and thus does not reach the bar of "cruel and unusual" punishment.".

However, inonline poker, the possibility of having a lot of hands is high because of the speed and multi tasking capabilities. It's just that people tend to forget and dismiss their losses with the said "lucky" hand perhaps because they've won a huge pot with it. The thing is, it still leads to skill, and players shouldn't just rely on lucky hands. They should be able to change and evolve the state of their hands and not rely on lucky cards because of superstitions.

The idea for the Ironman began as a challenge among a group of Navy SEALs who debated which sport was more physically demanding, running or swimming. The first Ironman was born in Hawaii in Feb. 18, 1978, when California triathletes John and Judy Collins organized the first endurance triathlon.

Daniel is really passionate. He keeps telling me about his hockey pool and I tell him about mine. It pretty funny. He knows his hockey really well. He actually really good friends with Phil Kessel. Over the years, he come to realize that the Canadiens are way, way better than the Maple Leafs, so he doesn want to make any more bets with me.
He underwent season ending right shoulder surgery last December, but said his arm felt good and will need only a couple of days to be 100 per cent. His timing will take a little bit to come back, he said, and the 88 degree morning temperature was hotter than he's used to.

If you find the toms sound thin, you can pick up some extra 57s to add some proximity effect and round out the sound. I used SDC mics as overheads and they sound good, but the toms lack some heft to the sound (even though they still sound full).

My in person experience was as big a swerve as if she had a free range pet emu just off camera the whole time, and just never mentioned it   why would I ask beforehand if she had an emu? By which I mean had no reason to suspect that she was actually, literally, paranoid and mentally ill, and had no idea that I should try to detect that, much less how.
There are still many monolithic, billion dollar institutions that will see their market wealth decimated if cannabis is legalized. Imo, the inevitable outcome of cannabis legalization involves a cigarette company having exclusive rights to produce and sell additive and pesticide laced junk that will keep prisons full and pharmaceutical companies rich. Especially when you factor in how complacent stoners are.. 
Also, healthy omnivores exist. All my ancestors lived into their 90s, no heart conditions in my family tree. Veganism is about ethics. You can be healthy eating meat, fish and veggies. Maybe not eating too much of the first. The main health benefits of veganism come from the fact it lower in calories and fat and higher in fibre than a shitty omni diet. But it no miracle and the environmental/ethics arguments are far stronger.

Something similar happened to my sister at the very same beach. A lady was holding a box of her own shit and was walking up and down yelling at people about she shit in her own box and minded her own business and would speak in tongues or something. Well, my sister was walking by her next and the lady raised up the box and yelled its raining shit and starting throwing it everywhere   my sister just stopped and let her do her thing so she could avoid confronting her   the lady saw my sister and started yelling things she couldn understand and said something about eating shit. She approached my sister rapidly and before the lady could say or do anything my sister punched her right in the nose and it knocked her out onto the concrete. Everyone cheered but my sis said she felt bad even though it was self defense because she knew the woman was just crazy and needed help. The amount of havoc stress/anxiety can release on your body knows no boundaries. It can manifest itself as so many things and can all be traced back to anxiety. I also use the apps and for when I am in my bed and need a pick me up. The less stress you have on your body the less inflammation because stress leads to inflammation in every part of your body and long term stress is no good on the organs and such.

Ich persnlich finde sowas wesentlich lustiger als (vieles an) pointenbasierten Humor, aber ist natrlich Geschmackssache. Aber gerade diese Art von Humor ist es ja auch, was uns im Ausland den Ruf einbringt, keinen Humor zu haben.
I white, but at my old job I went to a two day diversity training, and spoke with my work friends a lot about it after that. One of the things that really hit me hard that white people often don notice is little things that make being white seem like "the norm" and being a person of color seem "different/strange/not typical", things like "skin color/nude" in clothes and makeup being a pale Caucasian tone. Things like dolls being majority white and if there one black or Asian or Hispanic one they applauded for being so "diverse" even if 90% of their dolls are still white. 
People arrange to meet "by the hat", especially tall people when we are going into crowded rooms.
According to What HiFi they are good because they have a hollow tube running down the center of the cable to combat skin effect/proximity effect, and have low DC resistance and oxygen free copper.

"Anne's a good housekeeper," she said to Marilla in the spare room the night of their arrival. "I've looked into her bread box and her scrap pail. I always judge a housekeeper by those, that's what. There's nothing in the pail that shouldn't have been thrown away, and no stale pieces in the bread box. Of course, she was trained up with you but, then, she went to college afterwards. I notice she's got my tobacco stripe quilt on the bed here, and that big round braided mat of yours before her living room fire. It makes me feel right at home."

They not looking for dates and are only ever vaguely open to the possibility that they may find one out dancing. 
Dont be a little bitch with your chit chat just show me where your dicks at.
Strong association with UI driven development tools means newbies won get a sense of what actually happens between writing code and running it ("idk, I just hit F5 and it runs"). This really shows in interviews btw. Maybe some teams don care if you know anything about what happens behind the scenes, but mine does. Compare this with a language like C, which you can still write in a visual interface, but most resources will be teaching a bottom up approach where the student will have to learn about the nuts and bolts that an IDE takes care of for you.
Some will say: yes, but that college student will earn on average a million dollars more in her lifetime than someone who doesn have a degree and therefore it "worth it." But that is, of course, a misrepresentation of what "average" means. 
3. Rich candidates can buy the election. Although the NY Times is trying to spin Michael Bloomberg re election as mayor of New York City as "close," the truth is he won and he won because he outspent his opponent by 14 to 1. In fact, Bloomberg poured $90 million of his own dollars into the election.

You basically gonna have to eat the cost of a thorough annual inspection, a healthy amount of cheap/free troubleshooting, and probably cut a good rate on t for repairs to win this guy back and show him there are good techs out there and that only if you company is on board with it to keep the account. I know how it is, it sucks cleaning up after someone else. 
Sounds like a scammy way to effectively enjoy early retirement to me. And probably relatively easy to manufacture given PTSD is not uncommon among emergency personnel and they would be familiar with the symptoms and how to fake them. And since it's purely psychological, all they really have to do is act convincing for psychologists/ psychiatrists: it's not like there is any objective testing like with a medical illness.. 
For me my starting position will heavily influence my lockout, which is the weakest part of my lift.

The first dram from a bottle is usually not as good as after the bottle had a chance to oxidize a bit. I use the first dram in a cocktail or something to increase the headroom in the bottle and the amount of liquid exposed to air and give the bourbon a little bit of a chance to breath.

Coming from a long line of "strong" black women, I of course knew I could raise a child if I had to. But did I have to? Would my child be healthier or happier or more loved and cared for with me, or was there someone else who was more prepared to do the job? Someone who wasn't falling apart in every other way? Someone who desperately wanted something I could give?

I think if there an update we learn a lot more about why. If all the police officers were fake then they put on a big show. Like when he denied they were his parents and the police officer explained he was confused.

Get yourself a nice chair for nursing/feeding, and start planning a good space for the same out in your living room. It is not worth it to have to cover while nursing in front of in laws or try to get a baby to sleep around company, so you want a good space away from the living room, but you don want to be isolated while it just you+SO+the kids at home. If you bottle feeding, consider getting a mini fridge for beside the seat where you feed babies the most. Use that fridge for both milk AND drinks for you, because it is easy to forget to drink for you.

I genuinely want to ask why you think this? War is in fact the single greatest driver of human technological progress. Most modern innovations today derive themselves from some form of military research. Food preservation, transportation, communication, metallurgy, industrialization, logistics, management, etc.

When we say the Republican party is racist, it not because we trying to straddle anyone with something that happened in the 60s, it because we can point to ongoing and open racism at the core of the Republican party right now. Trump 2016 campaign was built on white identity politics. Literal neo Nazis crawled out from under their rocks in droves to enthusiastically support him because someone was finally representing them. And even if elected Republicans are sometimes frustrated by Trump crudeness and vulgarity, his behavior clearly represents the soul of the party.

You have to deal with whatever cable company works in your town. We don even have FiOS installed in half of the state and the majority of an entire county still only has dial up internet. Every city/town in Mass has a cable TV provider and you either pick cable internet through that company or if you lucky enough to be near Boston, some cities/towns out there have FiOS.

I pretty sure my mom is a narcissist, but she married my abuser. I guess turning your back while your husband abuses your kid is abusive as well but my mom has also been there for me when I needed help. She refuses to admit her husband abused me to this day. I forgiven her (I think), I just wish she would admit it happened. She beat a case against dyfs, because her and my stepfather pressured me to say he didn do anything and I made up a story about him to get rid of him. I was 11.
