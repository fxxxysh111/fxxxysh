1) Tires are inflated to lower pressure in the winter. Check your sidewall, but most say, "32 psi summer, 30 psi winter". 30 psi winter is actually more absolute air in the tires than 32 psi summer, and you don want to have a blowout if the tires heat up and you overinflated..

Although bad experiences (such as anxiety and agitation) are more common on 25x NBOMe due to adrenergic agonism causing unexpected stimulation, LSD itself binds to both 5 HT2a and D2   meaning it should have a higher risk for psychosis.

As much as we'd all love to see Pacquiao smash Timothy Bradley in a rematch, it doesn't make sense to pit these two bulldogs against each other considering the June bout drew less than a million PPV, something which hasn't happened to a Pacquiao card since the Joshua Clottey fight. Bradley didn't earn the title, and fighting him again would only lend credence to the notion that Pacquiao could have been involved in "the fix." A Pacquiao Bradley rematch would also seem to justify the impaired decision that resulted from "the scorecard heard 'round the world," and would ultimately send the wrong message to fans..

Brendan probably would have been convicted in 48 or 49 of the 50 states because it is extremely difficult for jurors to understand how or why people would confess to crimes they didn commit. You can take your average 12 people off the street and expect them to know anything about how coercive police interrogations can be, or how vulnerable people like Brendan are. It a travesty that our system does not require jurors involved in major criminal cases to attend a training course prior to serving as a juror, so that they can understand all the ways that people have been falsely convicted. Law enforcement personnel often do not perform their duties in a professional manner, as evidenced by the interrogations of Brendan Dassey. How can anyone expect that jurors will do an adequate job of assessing such police interrogations? The process is disgracefully inadequate nationwide.

The only way that the server is able to get more than two serves in a single point is when the ball clips the net, goes over and touches the box diagonally opposite.

Four lets are allowed, otherwise it is called a double fault and the point is given to the opponent.
A friend of mine stopped cosplaying with his boyfriend a lot because it was a mixture of fetishization and transphobia. I actually know more than just this couple who stopped doing this (joys of being a trans weeb I guess, we congregate), but this particular one said that he wasn sure if the transphobia or a fetishism was worse. One particular instance, they were doing some of the typical "plz kiss/eyefuck/simulate sex" requests (they did the more tame ones and shot down the more overly sexual ones) most BL/slash couple cosplayers got but once a girl in the crowd realized he was trans (his cosplay involved an open shirt and he thinks she must have noticed his top surgery scars) the questions and "requests" got a LOT more invasive and gross. It sounds like it was a case of a couple weeb BL fangirls who had literally no sense of not acting inappropriate in public and they didn actually mean any harm but the overt sexual fetishization of him being trans started like a microsecond after she had her lightbulb "oh you trans" moment and decided that it turned her on that he was trans and his boyfriend was cis (well she assumed anyway and was right in that case but it not like he couldn have been trans as well lol), and her friends to some extent got in on the inappropriate questioning and requests too.

Wow, this post really resonates with me. Yes. My mom did and still does value and devalue me based on sex. I had no lock on my bathroom or bedroom door growing up. Was not allowed to go to an Obgyn for terrible period pain. My mom drove by and stalked me at my place of work when I was in high school because she was convinced I was having sex. She'd read my journals to try and find out if I was having sex. I wasn't having sex with anyone. When I ended up with a terrible guy because I was trying to escape her, her main concern was whether I was having sex and that I was "a slut". I'm in my 30s now. to have sex). had sex). For someone who hates sex so much, my mom sure was obsessed with it.

I think that puts me in a territory of "casual viewer"? Anyways, as a casual viewer, I loved series 11. I liked Moffat and his ultra complicated lore and even his obvious fanboyism showing through the episodes, but it kind of nice to just have an episode on and enjoy it rather than having to know all the backstory. All of the episodes from series 11 were standalones and while they kind of lack depth and character development I enjoyed the stories as themselves and appreciate that I can just turn it on even when I tired from work and have fun with pregnant dude in space or witch hunting with Allan Cummings even if I couldn catch last week episode or don know the series long arc.

A hangnail is dry excess skin around the cuticle. It is not really a nail so the term is misleading. It seems to just have come from nowhere but it cannot be ignored because it can be painful. It is unsightly and can cause discomfort. The best way to prevent a hangnail is to take care of your hands. Use lotions and creams specific for hand and nail care. A hangnail is dry skin so moisturize! Another major cause of hangnails is because people bite their nails. This weakens your nails and cuticles, and causes hangnails.

Spa facial treatments use lotions, masks and treatments that could cause a flare up in just about any of these skin conditions   and so can drugstore products, even when they're labeled as being a good choice for sensitive skin. Since "sensitive" means so many different things, there's no telling which skin type or problem it's best for. So if you have trouble with your skin, the best thing to do is to talk to your doctor or a licensed skin specialist, and make a habit of reading up on all the labels before you try something new..

I just have my one narrow experience and those that I've learned about while in NA.

There is a whole lot of other stuff that you need to know about playing good Texas Holdem. There is so much more to it than people think. The number one tip I can give you (besides good bankroll management) is have a plan for the hand you are playing and go through with it. What I mean by this is in the beginning of the hand when you choose if you want to play it or not you should already have a rough idea of what you are going to do depending on how the hand plays out. If that guy raises you should pretty much know before he did it if you going to play or fold.

One other thing to be aware of in home games is players palming chips. Whoever pushes the pot to the winner should automatically turn their palms face up to show that they did not take any chips. This should be standard practice even among friends. Professional dealers are required to do this in all live games. In tournament play the professional dealer would have no reason to take tournament chips, but at a home game it prevents any question about honesty.

The Two Faces of Dr Jekyll (1960)DirectorTerence FisherStudioHammer Film ProductionsPlotDr Jekyll is obsessed with his work, ignoring his wife and not realising she has become his disreputable friend Paul's mistress. The film's main flaw is that the lead, Paul Massie, isn't strong enough an actor to convincingly play both Jekyll and Hyde, a fact made apparent when he is surrounded by actors of such calibre as Christopher Lee (possibly the definitive Dracula) and Oliver Reed in an early, uncredited film role. Oliver Reed so impressed director Terence Fisher that he was cast in increasingly larger roles in Fisher's next films, Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960) and The Curse of the Werewolf (1961), launching his career that led to international stardom. Massie's career, on the other hand, failed to take off.
There is much in David Grant biography of Kirk, The Mighty Totara, published in 2014, that explains their admiration. In particular, if there is one thing that sets Kirk apart, it was his ability to dream big, especially in foreign policy. 
Edit: adding to that, think of the psychological effect of being one that gets sexual attention Vs someone that absolutely doesn A girl that gets hit on at least a few times can have some kind of (probably unrealistic) measuring stick as to their own self worth, this usually builds confidence which by itself is typically an increase to your sexual worth guy that gets 0 sexual attention (most guys) will have an inverse effect of lowering his confidence and thus actually plummeting his sexual worth even further. It a cruel cycle for both because it tends to get out of hand and give people unrealistic expectations.

The white Southerner was always given his due by Mr. Muhammad. The white Southerner, you can say one thing he is honest. He bares his teeth to the black man; he tells the black man, to his face, that Southern whites never will accept phony "integration." The Southern white goes further, to tell the black man that he means to fight him every inch of the way against even the so called "tokenism." The advantage of this is the Southern black man never has been under any illusions about the opposition he is dealing with.

There's actually a story where someone mugged Lenin and he asked him "do you know who I am?" and the guy said he didn't know. It was supposed to be a people's thing. Some Communist revolutionaries do this today like the Zapatistas in Mexico where the leader is just some masked dude. 
He also said "you're good", which basically conveys you should table your hand. Some people will table their bluffs very confidently and without saying anything, hoping to get their opponent to muck accidentally   I'd say that is more angle shooty.

I much rather have good blue collar jobs (and subsidize them if need be), because then all the other professions would select more for interest and quality, rather than self interest and self preservation. ie, doctors who want to be doctors, rather the doctors who want to work in a well paid profession. And then all manner of education would become cheaper, and more efficient, and more effective.

Idk why that is hard to understand. I was trying to get him off of any draw, I didn realize the guy flopped a set of 9 Not sure how often you play but a value raise often steals the pot, especially vs the people I play in this particular live game, which is why the small re raise on the flop. Obviously you do it too much and someone is going to take advantage of you, but if I can steal $200 $300 dollar pots with value bets or raises more often than I get re raised then it a very effective way to make money.

You may like the idea of using herbal remedies because they are natural, but like any other medication, medicinal herbs are dangerous if they're not used properly.

From the book. You were just off for six weeks from surgery so you definitely lost some fitness, and despite having a strong history you certainly don have the base right now that Pfitz calls for prior to starting the 18/55 schedule. The first long run in the schedule is 12 miles. Have you comfortably completed a run close to that length in the last month? If I were you, I would build my base up more. Sure it ultimately your call and you can go for it anyway. Boston qualifying times are more forgiving for women so you got that going for you as well. But keep in mind that given where you are right now, it is risky. I think July is too early, but there are marathons that can qualify you for Boston 2020 as late as September and that would give you more time to prepare and get your mileage up gradually. You may be able to complete the mileage but I think you going to struggle to get the quality to be of the quality you need for it to help you.

Out of position you might want to x/r a low flush draw on a dynamic board a high percentage of the time with an spr of 13, with an spr of 36 you might have to be much more careful (1) playing out of position on a board that may have a lot of texture shifts and where in position gains the ability to put immense pressure with a deeper stack and (2) putting non nutted hands in what may turn out to be a very polarized line at that spr.

Add some more oil. Add spices like paprika, cumin powder, coriander powder, celery salt, salt, pepper etc. Turn the heat up to medium high and sautee all this for a few more minutes until you see a sear on your veggies.Now add your toasted grain back to the pan, add water or stock, cover with a lid, and simmer on low heat or medium low heat until it gets cooked.When cooked, garnish with lots of cilantro or diced scallions or toasted chopped almonds or all of the above!Because the grain is toasted and the veggies are seared separately, the texture will be a whole lot different than a clumpy soggy mass.

The 4 main types of poker playing styles are: 1. 2. Loose passive   Players who use this style are often referred to as "calling stations" or "fish." Like the loose aggressive player, they play many hands. But unlike the loose aggressive player, the loose passive player tends to check and call more than they bet or raise. 3. Tight passive   This style basically consists of only playing very few hands, and doing very little betting or raising. 4. Tight aggressive   This is the preferred playing style used by most professional poker players. It involves being highly selective with the starting hand selection and betting and raising very aggressively. (Full Answer)

It hurts so bad in all the wrong ways. My guild decided to start doing mythic (for the first time) in Uldir. We only do 2 nights each week and are usually pretty chill cruising through heroic. We ended up getting 5/8M before we went on break before Christmas; we fought so hard in Mythic and high level M+ to get all our 20 man team to at least 385ilvl. That feeling of being geared enough to go straight into heroic when BoD releases was so satisfying, and we felt that we had grinded mythic enough to earn that. Then, on the morning of the release of BoD, I got on my 375 alt, did an emissary quest and got a 415ilvl piece of gear and, a 400 wep from a warfront. Did a couple of M+5 and boom   more geared then my main.

The IMF had set meaningless quantitative targets in designing and approving the EFF programme on September 4, 2013, and has since shown great in monitoring them to help the government keep the programme operational and raise foreign exchange resources to repay its debt. As the government failed to meet even those meaningless targets, the IMF came to its rescue in each of the last five reviews of the programme. The first review was completed by giving one waiver, and the second, third, and fourth/fifth combined by giving two waivers each time.

You see, in poker, there's something called variance. Variance is the stats nerd's way of saying that, in order to generate an average profit of, say, $100 an hour, you have to tolerate swings of thousands and sometimes even tens of thousands of dollars. Let's say you start a session with $10,000 and end up with $11,000 five hours later. Hey, you just had a great day, averaging $200 per hour in profit over five hours. But, during those five hours, you may at some point have been down to $1,000 and at another point been up to $20,000.

David Malley's 1975 biography "The Ernie Kovacs Phile" helped spread the image of Kovacs as a poker playing, cigar chomping, ill rehearsed, budget busting savant burning the candle at both ends. 1990's "Kovacsland" by Diana Rico did little to balance the scales. That image has overshadowed the precision, wit and innovation behind the best Kovacs gags. (But call us if you have a copy of the 1984 TV movie starring Jeff Goldblum as Kovacs, "Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter"   even though it only focuses on the decidedly unfunny chapter in his life when his ex wife kidnapped their children and Kovacs searched the country for them.)

He also created the popular images of Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, the Republican elephant Democrat donkey, and the Tammany tiger.

Michel Foucault says "sex is the secret" of modernity, a secret we are incessantly forced to confess, first through the literal confession of the Catholic Church, but within the last century, through the couch of psychoanalysis then as the demand to "come out" because of sexual identity politics and in the past decades for entertainment on the Jerry Springer Show or for "networking" on Facebook.

Every team must get an equal chance and there should be as much independence from seeding as possible. That is, all teams should have a fair shot at winning the tournament (and/or qualifying to the next level). No team should have to do something different in the schedule from the other teams because of how they are seeded. Now it may be that some pools are of different size than other pools (there just isn any number that divides into thirteen!),but in this case an entire pool is playing more games than other pools. No team in the larger pool is doing anything different than any other team in that pool.

Plastic Poker Chips have also been called the honest tokens and first came on the scene in the 1930s as an inexpensive alternative to the traditionally clay or clay composite chips that are found in professional casinos. The Depression gave rise to the need for an inexpensive chip that could be easily used throughout all the illegal speakeasies that dotted the landscape during Prohibition. It was simple to dispose of plastic chip sets to avoid detection and their loss so that no one suffered financially.

This is a bastardization of Marxism Leninism as this is a very complex and detailed ideology, but you can summarize their belief as this: they institute state capitalism, where the new revolutionary government takes the place of the capitalist class and uses these funds to build up the country's infrastructure, economy, and defense. Then they transition into socialism once they material conditions are suitable for it, and from there once there is worldwide socialism they believe the state and the population will essentially merge and the state will thus wither away, instituting communism..

Catholic Answers, probably not.I'm a woman and it's taken me years trying to "figure out" my mom and sisters to realize this. Of course, I became a lot more self aware (and therefore patient) when I realized this. And then the "figuring out" is how that person feels loved (I think it's a lot more based on individual than the love language general ideas)The trick is that women think we know how we want to be loved (and I'm talking generally here, not just in marriage, but in friendships and family, too), when sometimes we don't.

Our relationship is healthy and I respect him a lot as a person, which also affects things sexually in a positive way. I started enjoying my orgasms 100% more and stopped rushing them.
