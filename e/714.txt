Selective is a terrible word here, so forgive me for using it again below. I don't think it captures the way the schools use it vs the accepted use of the word selective.

I explain why: from an early age, women are bombarded with the idea that all men want is sex. When you look up "birthday gifts for men," the first answer is usually "steak and a blowjob." The internet is full of people explaining that romantic gestures are wasted on men, men don care about material items, and a steak and a blowjob are literally the height of masculine luxury. "Steak a Blowjob Day", supposedly the masculine counterpart to Valentine Day, literally has its own Wikipedia page.

But whoever owns it at the time of that photo, I assume not the woman pictured since her apparel is more of the "I need a mixte frame" variety, had the good sense to slap a board on it, adding to its already considerable heft. Presumably the board is braced properly so whatever/whoever ends up sitting on it doesn cause stress fractures on the tubing, which is probably not Columbus, not Dedacciai, probably not even double butted. Just terrible.. 
I feel like after revoking her citizenship, all this does is that it leaves a newborn in a warzone, and gives fuel to the fire of people in the UK on the verge of radicalisation.

It doesn matter when you retire. Your ability to live your life is simply a function of yearly expenses and return on investments. While I think the 4% rule is overly optimistic it illustrates that if you live on $40k/year then you need $1m to retire. 
Pros make decent money, but not fantastic money, unless they are at the very top tier of the game, and either have an enormous bankroll they won at tournaments, or they're playing with money invested by a third party who has confidence in their ability to turn a profit with it.

Air New Zealand have a really smart livery on their 787 Dreamliner, and it is actually different to the regular livery of their aircraft (such as B777 and narrowbody planes). Without being overpowering, the black plane just works and makes it stand out from the runway, whatever the weather. Another change of livery for their modern aircraft has came from Etihad, whose sleek and slender fuselage is now complemented with a cool new tailfin design, which is one of the better liveries here. I have always liked the livery of KLM on any of its aircraft even narrowbodies as it is extremely smart and light blue and whites go very well together in its particular style, and this is personified by its appearance on the 787 Dreamliner.

Today I own the rentals outright with no debt. With the current structure in place, we decided to now seek out larger mutlifamily properties. With minimal debt and significant equity (I had also been investing in the stock market and alternative investments) securing agency debt was a challenge and an excellent learning experience. Freddie Mac took a fine tooth comb through our lives, financial track records, and the deal on a 74 unit apartment complex in Memphis, just outside of Germantown. It has been an amazing experience operating at that level, and I now have bigger plans of expanding to other regions and larger deals. But I'm still a grinder. I don't want to go broke ever again.

Also, a little more than a month ago, I was free lunging Ollie and he slipped and fell. When he got up, he was having crazy muscle spazems in his back/side and he was coughing non stop.

Of course some smaller groups will and do plan "culture invasions" and it's a free country so I don't see what can be done to stop it. It is inevitable that those that thrive will supplant the stagnant or stationary people's. It's evolution, ironic that it's replacing religious folk.

It kinda important to point out that an annulment in the Catholic Church does not replace the divorce process; nor, contrary to popular opinion, does it render the kids of said marriage illegitimate. The marriage can be considered putative, meeting all the legal requirements, without being sacramental; a declaration of nullity acknowledges that the marriage, not being sacramental, was flawed in some way and thus did not actually occur.

The real value of the Post series is that the facts and figures coming out might shame politicians in Washington to investigate and possibly limit some of these excesses. real shift in American priorities and spending would require a lot more than facts and figures. would require a revolution.

After the luster of the silver boom wore off in Creede, Poker Alice drifted up to Deadwood, which was still producing plenty of gold for the gambling dens working the miners. She worked as a table dealer at a saloon owned by a wealthy gambler known as "Bedrock Tom." Another dealer working there was Warren G. Tubbs, a house painter by trade but dealer by necessity. For whatever the reason the two struck up a friendship that eventually evolved into a true romance. Poker Alice proved her affection by drilling a drunken miner who was trying to gut Warren with a long bladed knife. The miner had the dealer backed against a wall and was going for the fatal plunge when his paramour's.38 blew a gaping hole in his knife arm. A few weeks later Warren proposed marriage and a new life as a chicken farmer.

Well. When you warp the distance you are from the enemy is set by the ai based on the range of your weapons, so ideally you want weapons with similar optimal range to best take advantage of warp. If you stack all lasers with the same range you generally warp around the far end of that range, giving you shots on the enemy before they have a chance to close in again. If you stack shotguns you warp very close to the enemy and tear them up. If you have a mix of ranges it seems to be a roll of the dice what exactly happens, less than optimal.
Eric Noble, president of The Car Lab consulting firm in Orange, Calif., sees Toyota as the "800 pound gorilla of hybrid technology."

These sometimes decide the game because the Hammer is so OP and all drops have a pink/mythic gun in them. All games are a little different, so it depends where they drop. Obviously if you nowhere near them don worry about them, but if you are close take inventory of what you have; are you ready to defend yourself if people come hunting you? If yes, then go for it, if not, either get away orrr try to sneak attack them yourself. It best to attack right after the package is opened because they have no cover but haven acquired the weapons yet. If you get a mythic weapon use it at all times, because it will do the most damage, except of course the sniper in close quarters combat. If you get thor hammer, it takes about 3 4 seconds to reload, so have something else to switch too. It does area damage, so if they by a tree or wall you can aim for that and hope to still get the damage. Be aware of this though if you hear the thunder from your opponent, because they have the ability to hit you if you behind a tree.

Did you know his first lead engineer was Chinese? Bill was so progressive! Did you know Bill himself flew the first test flight? He was so brave! They had employee Christmas parties and bonuses starting in 1922. They hired females not just to stitch the wings but to help design them. Boeing set the region's standard for pay, benefits and fair hiring. Bill was the one who first developed places like Blue Ridge and Innis Arden and the Highlands.

Please don't do this. There are so many reasons to live. Life has so much in store for you I promise. You'll have more love, more laughs, more beautiful sunny days, more projects to feel proud of, more challenges to overcome and feel triumphant about, more crazy family drama that you can roll your eyes about, more delicious hot chocolates, more awesome Netflix series, more great walks in nature that will astound you, more random acts of kindness by strangers, more pizza, more blankets to snuggle under on cold Sunday mornings, more books to enjoy, more doggies to pet  please give life a chance. I know you are in so much pain right now, but believe me it will pass in time. Take some time right now to think of your reasons to live.

I could tell poor people in 3rd world countries with bad living conditions to "work hard" and what will that get me? People shitting on me for being inconsiderate. 
No stray dogs, even. 
Those countries pay their workers a dollar a week and force them to live at the job to make money. If the whole world made a law stating everyone makes the exact same wage, with the same benefits, and the same hours to work, then we will see less moving of factories to other countries and more people living life as they should. It could be the one move that could end world hunger.. 
Yeah, it the most generic fantasy setting that I ever seen. Carbon copy of Tolkien with some of that post GoT edge. Any fantasy with elves and dwarves that not part of AD or Tolkien automatically gets a "are you fucking KIDDING ME STOP WITH THIS SHIT" but couple that with the Gary Stu, immortal gorgeous sex god main character, the adolescent male power fantasy run amok main character, and it just absolutely un fucking bearable. Worst fantasy story of the past decade, hands down.

I genuinely do not understand why you think I am "triggered" by the mention of therapy, or that I have something against it. Quite the opposite, as it has been exceptionally beneficial for me.

This reminds me of a post on another subreddit where someone was talking about how unrealistic it was to have smaller female actresses portrayed as ass kicking action stars, essentially because they not buff enough.

Texas Hold is a poker game that has taken the world by storm. So what is it about this particular poker game that created such a sensation? There are several points that play into the popularity of the game, including the "star status" achieved by some of the professional players.

Given how long it takes to develop these techniques, I think both teams had worked on these ideas for several months before that, so it is fair to say that they were developed independently and in parallel.

Libratus subgame solving approach is more advanced in at least the following ways that are detailed in our Science paper:DeepStack does not share Libratus's improvement of de emphasizing (still in a provably safe way) hands the opponent would only be holding if she had made an earlier mistake.DeepStack does not share the feature of changing the subgame action abstraction between hands.We have various kinds of equilibrium finding algorithm independent guarantees of safety and approximate safety of our subgame solving in the Science paper and in our NIPS 17 paper.Another difference is in how the two AIs approach the first two betting rounds.

Since markets as a whole inevitably make money over a long enough time, you are basically guaranteed to profit over the long run. So this will probably return 5% to 10% over the long run, so long as you buy and hold, but you will see fluctuations in excess of that amount every year. Your portfolio could increase 50% or drop 30%, but so long as you buy and hold your long turn expectation should be an average increase of 5% to 10% per year..
