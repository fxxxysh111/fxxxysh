I like the idea of being in the early adopters program, but I don think being a beta tester it quite enough in this case.

Something tells me there will be absolutely no rush to get my car suited up and ready to go for the program.

There has to be adjustments made against certain opponents if you seeking to make more money (as you should). GTO is seeking to play a game that will never lose.

Revoking citizenship is unheard of for good reason. Next time the UK wants to deport someone undesirable they just opened the door to other countries saying no and revoking their own citizens rights to return.

There seem to be a LOT of selfish, narc y JNs with bizarrely bad palates who insist upon EVERYONE following their preference for aggressively bad food. Sad Tacos is the first one who comes to mind, but there have been many shockingly bad cooks and freakishly picky eaters who insist that EVERYONE must share their food neuroses. Industrial strength blandness seems to be a common attribute, as if giving your taste buds a little exercise is some kind of scary, forbidden sin that NO ONE must experience. There's also a lot of overly greasy/fatty, sugary and salty food, like the JNs are stuck in a childish, undeveloped level of primitive food indulgence. Forbidden are ethnic or highly flavored foods and/or interesting vegetables prepared in a manner that enhances their qualities not just boiling or deep frying. It's not surprising that a good number of the JNMILs have serious weight problems from all of the narc self indulgence in unhealthy foods and the willful refusal to accept that there are consequences to bad and unhealthy behaviors.

In my sincere opinion, this is actually a very good description of the subtler kinds of abuse!

Am I the only one who thinks the floor got the string bet ruling completely wrong? If there ruling is correct, then this definately allows for exploits. For instance, if I have a stack of large denomination chips, I grab the whole stack, place it past the (invisible) betting line, and without letting go of the stack I can then decide how many chips I want to let go of, and how many chips I want to take back. Let say there is a pot with $200 in it, I could grab a stack of 20 $100 chips, move them forward, and only drop two of them, and pull the rest back.

But young pitcher or old, Frandsen is clearly overmatched at this level.

In Brobdingnag, some of the queen's maids see no problem with stripping naked, changing in front of Gulliver, and even resting him on their bosoms. Gulliver gives a pretty horrifying account of their skin blemishes and large pores, and even the terrible odors emanating from their bodies, which will knock the wind out of anyone's boner sails. One maid puts Gulliver right on her nipple, which will no doubt afford some of you many an exhilarating masturbation fantasy tonight. But the worst by far was when poor Gully was used as a sex toy to pleasure the maids   he mentions "many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over particular."

I found one chilling in movies, on his phone. Mind you, we made 15, 10, and 5 minute announcements, and this guy just chatters his way through, looking for a movie. The manager radios over the headset to see if we have any customers left, and I pipe up with "Yeah, I got a guy I been tailing throughout DVDs, impressively ignoring me." He hears me, turns around, hangs up, stutters an apology, and bolts for the front door.

I read the entire article, so no I didn ignore context.

Acupuncture. The use of acupuncture and acupressure is thousands of years old. These therapies were developed in ancient China and are based on the theory of energy flowing through a system of channels (called meridians) that flow through the body and are linked to certain internal organs. Disease is seen in large part as disharmony in this internal energy flow, and the purpose of acupuncture is to restore the balance. Acupuncturists may do this by using needles, finger pressure, heat sources, or other methods to manipulate certain specific points (or acupoints) along the meridians. Western scientific research is still at a loss to explain why acupuncture works. Some theories suggest that inserting the needles increases the body's production of endorphins (substances that make you feel better and more comfortable) and blocks the transmission of pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain.

In our world, it is difficult to construct a unilinear narrative. 
"In the context of the Pledge, the statement that the United States is a nation "under God" is an endorsement of religion. It is a profession of a religious belief, namely, a belief in monotheism. The recitation that ours is a nation "under God" is not a mere acknowledgment that many Americans believe in a deity. Nor is it merely descriptive of the undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of the Republic. Rather, the phrase "one nation under God" in the context of the Pledge is normative. To recite the Pledge is not to describe the United States; instead, it is to swear allegiance to the values for which the flag stands: unity, indivisibility, liberty, justice, and   since 1954   monotheism. The text of the official Pledge, codified in federal law, impermissibly takes a position with respect to the purely religious question of the existence and identity of God. A profession that we are a nation "under God" is identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation "under Jesus," a nation "under Vishnu," a nation"under Zeus," or a nation "under no god," because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion."

In our not too distant past, humans were mostly focused on survival. Worrying about things like whether you'd have something to eat when you were hungry or a safe to sleep when you were tired were more important than pondering the idea of happiness. And although there are still people around the world who struggle with meeting their basic needs, most of us have the luxury of a little free time.

Memorial Day is obviously an important ritual, but not to remember fallen soldiers, which seems to have been its original intent (although the historical record is somewhat unclear on who started it and whether it was to remind ourselves that the costs of war are too high or just to make heroes of those who had died as soldiers). In any event, the fact is that Memorial Day has become a ritual of summer, a way to mark the beginning of the season of swimming pools, bbqs, and to at least imagine that our lives have more leisure in them.

Amazon didn just capitalize on one stop shop eCommerce, they essentially invented the space. They were able to do what they did because they were smaller, didn have a physical storefront, and were able to start in a product (books) that people were willing to buy online because Amazon could offer a better selection than retail stores and could massively undercut their prices. Even then Amazon didn turn a profit in their eCommerce segment for like two decades and even now they make more money from web services than they do selling physical products to consumers.

I divided 1,100 by six instead of 57 because I did a mental quick dirty and I come up with 18. So I knew I'd have either 18 or 19 3 number winners and that's 50 bucks each. At 18 I got $1,000 for a 4 number winner, and I got 18 3 number winners worth $50 each, so that's 900 bucks. So I got $1,100 invested and I've got a $1,900 return..

Not sure why you got downvoted for asking a question. It because of the absolutely obscene variance combined with the very small and still diminishing edges in the games.

Yes of course they want to join in. After all it looks so easy when the professionals raise all in with a Jack high and steal the pot on a complete bluff against two pairs. What they don't realise is that it takes years of practise to develop the instinct to know when they can bluff like that. The other point they miss is that TV will edit out the majority of hands and will give a distorted view of the play, it will look like these big bluffs can be pulled off every two or three hands!

Tucked into the heath care bill is a seemingly reasonable tax on cosmetic surgery. It an easy tax to support, like taxes on cigarettes and sodas. After all, cosmetic procedures are completely unnecessary to our health, by definition, and  like cigarettes and sodas  potentially harmful. But none of these products are distributed evenly in the population. In fact, they all tend to be consumed by poor and working class Americans more than the rich and educated ones. And therefore taxing any of these products is always regressive, a larger burden on the poor than the rich.
