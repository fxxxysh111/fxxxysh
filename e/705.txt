You could probably trick it though :), not sure if the orange 3.3v wires from the PSU would be enough but you could run one of those in the cable that goes to the mod and connect that to the balance charging pins on the board, it would now see 3x 3.3v, it would think the batteries are low but it should still fire. OR, connect one of these to a red 5v wire in the PSU which will reduce the voltage to 4.2v, and run that into the mod for the balanced charging pins! Then it should think there are 3 fully charged (4.2v) batteries attached :).

And today comes this revelation that the social network was developing personalization tools with multiple tech partners, giving them extensive access to user data.

During the first Gulf War, at a protest in New York City where I lived at the time, I was so utterly and completely depressed by the anti war movement, such as we were, that I started chanting "I tired, I cranky, I don like the government." the chant struck a chord with the crowd. We were all chanting it. Perfect summary of a populace so burned out by corporate/military "democracy" that we could no longer think of anything more inspiring to do than chant our collective depression..

There's one other thing about standing for an extended period of time; I tended to get hungrier than I do when I'm slumped on a chair. That felt like confirmation of the stand up advocates' belief that you burn more calories when you stand than when you sit. For this reason alone, I'm hoping that sit/stand desks one day hit the mainstream, with mass market furniture companies making many low priced versions. We could all do with a bit more standing up.

Kind, nerdy, independent and funny (even if just in private, because laughing together is such a great way to bond). I don particularly care if my partner is extroverted or introverted, shy or outgoing, but I do need them to have their own independent life, interests and friends (of both genders preferably). Which is why being independent and nerdy is so important to me. Kindness and empathy is also incredibly important, few moments are more attractive to me than when I see my partner being genuinely considerate, not just to friends but to strangers as well. I want a partner who is kind to me, but it is equally important that they just a good person in general. He said it first at around the two month mark, while black out drunk (his delivery was equal parts adorable, heartfelt and absurd) at a festivals minutes before puking his guts out. He didn remember after, I didn say it back, and all in all I just laughed it off. The second time he said it was about a month later, he was sober, very sincere and had clearly thought a long time about how to tell me, which makes it all the more awkward that my immediate response was "yeah. You said that before". Luckily he had both a lot of self confidence and patience and took it in strides. I managed to tell him I really cared for him but wasn ready to say it yet, so a month later when I finally did say it back, I genuinely meant it. He an awesome guy and I happy he was my first real love.

It's not until after he sees her scars that it's communicated that she never hears from him again.

Yes, absolutely include it as this scenario is a very common case. If one level is extremely common, then the variable isn very interesting.

Sure, Bond's cards worked this one time, but that was dumb luck. In the poker world, this is called a bad beat   when a considerably stupider player stays in with a statistically impossible pair of cards and somehow manages to win against more skilled players. Bond isn't some amazing strategist, but rather the spy equivalent of some fanny pack wearing tourist blindly spinning a roulette wheel, randomly winning, and then attributing that win to skill.

That's not to take anything away from Jessica Chastain, who inhabits the role of poker impresario Molly Bloom with such panache and vivaciousness that she may well take home a best actress Oscar. Whatever plaudits she receives, though, will be due to Sorkin's cunning screenplay."Molly's Game" is Sorkin's directorial debut, and captures the same staccato patter of Sorkin's trademark TV series "Sports Night," "The West Wing" and "The Newsroom," as well as the awards darling films he penned, "The Social Network," "Moneyball" and "Steve Jobs."Bloom narrates the bewildering tale after the fact, explaining how she was was a genius and elite athlete turned chronic underachiever in her early 20s. Once she starts working as a hostess at a high caliber poker game populated by celebrities, political power brokers and millionaires, she begins to find her calling.

We study a simplified version of full street, three player Kuhn poker, in which the weakest card, J, must be checked and/or folded by a player who holds it. The number of nontrivial betting frequencies that must be calculated is thereby reduced from 23 to 11, and all equilibrium solutions can be found analytically. In particular, there are three ranges of values of the pot size, P, for which there are three distinct, coexisting equilibrium solutions. We also study an ordinary differential equation model of repeated play of the game, which we expect to be at least qualitatively accurate when all players both adjust their betting frequencies sufficiently slowly and have sufficiently short memories. We find that none of the equilibrium solutions of the game is asymptotically stable as a solution of the ordinary differential equations. Depending on the pot size, the solution may be periodic, close to periodic or have long chaotic transients. In each case, the rates at which the players accumulate profit closely match those associated with one of the equilibrium solutions of the game.

Ich halte das Vorgehen die Argumentation der FAZ fr richtig, auch wenn ich dem Beitrag inhaltlich in keiner Weise zustimme.

No, the reality is we all suffer and worry, and in most cases "being happy" is only a temporary reprieve, never a state able to be attained or sustained.

Instead of explaining, ask and listen. Ask her what her concerns are. Ask her what sources she would find credible. Ask her what she is worried might happen to you. Ask her if you could do anything to put her mind at ease (such as promising to stop if you have x, y, or z symptom). If you find yourself explaining again   stop and go back to asking, listening, and answering just her specific questions. Hopefully this will help her come to be supportive. Ask her if she would be willing to support you while you do this thing to be healthier so you can be a healthier couple together.

This is much easier with certain items than with others. For example, art, artifacts, collectibles. If I have a painting, or Marlon Brando jacket from some movie, or a set of armor used in some historical battle, those are far more subjectively valued than say a modern car or a house, where the government can say "hang on, your neighbour house is very similar to yours and only sold for 1/3rd as much, that sounds off." Say that you wanted to reduce your taxable income. You could come to me and say "sell me this item for $100K at auction, but coincidentally give me $99K as a gift the next day." I effectively sold you an item for $1K, but now you have evidence that it actually worth 100x that. You bribe someone to value it as such and then donate it to a museum. Now you might be paying $30K less in tax for the year because you gave away something worth $1K. It generally a little more elaborate than this but you get the idea.

For example, in the above example when the opponent made a $20 dollar bet into a pot of $100 optimal theory say fold 6 out of the one time, but if you have been noticing the guy has been bluffing a lot more times than is optimal game theory, then the only way to make money is to call him more than is optimal according to game theory and try to out play your opponent or improve your hand. If you notice a tight player folding more than is optimal, than bluffing more than optimal is going to be the best strategy to make a profit. (Full Answer).

I realize it difficult to empathize with your girlfriend and you loyal to your Mom. But think of it this way: Say you received your dream job. This opportunity is a once in a lifetime job and you stoked. You can wait to tell the world! In your excitement you tell your parents the good news. Before you have a chance to tell everyone else, you receiving congratulatory texts and calls from people you haven spoken to in years. How? Why?

I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, yes, Bueller is an asshole who has no concerns about anyone else feelings or needs. But he exists as a plot device, a foil to the world around him. Everyone else in the movie is interested in following rules because they are the rules, not the purpose that those rules are actually supposed to serve. You go to work because that what you supposed to do. You go to school because that is what you supposed to do. While his refusal to follow any rules, or to acknowledge the point of said rules does move him firmly into the realm of he there to point out the absurdity of the people around him. I mean, if I actually knew someone like that, I think that person needed to be medicated or arrested. I find it easier to think of him as an idea than a character.

These, my friend, are not cheap tricks, mind you! Poker chip tricks have been developed through long rigorous hours of playing poker. Poker addicts have developed a method killing waiting time. Also, poker chip tricks are used to intimidate other poker players. You might have seen a player randomly rotate his stack of poker chips using a single hand. Some poker fanatics also employ magic coin tricks using poker chips. Not only is watching this very fun to look at but it is also a very serious discipline. Learning these poker chip tricks needs hours to master. A serious poker player is different from a serious poker chip tricks master. Often, the poker fanatics are also the trick players, but poker chip tricks have surpassed the mere poker game. There are even poker chip trick tournaments in the US!

I'm concerned that in another decade or two, the people who are doing less well are going to rise up and just say they won't take it anymore, and we'll have riots like we did in Athens, Greece.
