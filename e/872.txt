Downtown is a prime example of the lack of give a damn that permeates throughout most of the coastal bend. The reason people don move away is because there is a weird sense of ownership to living in CC. Almost like,"Corpus Christi is a shithole, but it is MY shithole."

After the Red Cross confirmed their deaths, and Miep knew that Anne would not be coming back for the diary, she told Otto that she had kept it and 327 loose papers safe.

Superiority or inferiority was indicated when the effect size equalled plus or minus 0.5.How were differences between studies investigated?Sensitivity analyses were performed by using different cut off points for the quality score to reclassify the level of evidence, and also by using different effect size cut off points to classify efficacy.Results of the reviewNine RCTs (683 patients) were included.Most of the included RCTs had substantial methodological flaws. The quality scores ranged from 21 to 87 out of 100 points.There were 2 RCTs of SMT versus amitriptyline: one involved 218 patients with chronic migraine and the other involved 150 patients with chronic and episodic tension type headaches.

I don know if my own personal friends would joke about humiliating and raping women just because they could without consequence, and I don think the majority of people on here would condone that (as seen on AskReddit sections on male/female rape); no one would go on there, bragging about the celebrity they would grope if time were frozen.

The virulently feminist students just sort of shrugged, so maybe I really not onto something here. 
This is a pretty good guide. There are some little things I quibble with here or there, but most things aren worth mentioning. Overall, I think this is helpful. The one thing that I feel compelled to mention (to keep foreigners from developing any more of a reputation for being rude) is step 4 of your traffic rules. As a general rule, the Balinese DON honk. They consider it rude. You will occasionally hear Indonesians honking in Bali, but it almost always a transplant from another part of the country. If you want to keep in people good graces, avoid honking unless it truly an emergency.

Because handguns are easier to use, easy to conseal, lightweight, you can more easily find compatible ammo, magazines, and even carry several magazines in your pockets, they are very easy to reload quickly, and many have as many bullets in a mag as a legal rifle magazine.

They are more accurate that one would think, easy to fix in the field, easier to suppress with items simply found around us, they are often not as loud as a rifle, and certainly quieter than a shotgun, they do not have a short range, they are honestly harder to fumble or drop, less recoil means faster refire while retaining a general ammount of accuracy, and 9mm (the most common pistol round) can penetrate most surfaces at close range.

Galaxies would be destroyed as stars separate from the main black hole. Approximately three months before the Big Rip, theSolar System(or systems similar to our own at this time, as the fate of the Solar System 22 billion years in the future is questionable) would be gravitationally unbound.

This was done out of fear that these Armenian populated areas could hinder or compromise the empires ability to defend itself from foreign invaders considering there were many Armenians who volunteered to help the Russians coming from the east.

But according to an April 2018 article in National Women's Health Network, it's vital to consider the countless stressful life experiences including child bearing and breast feeding, job dissatisfaction and unemployment, relationship problems, aging and illness, to name a few major issues that can lead to decreased sexual desire and satisfaction. Depression, anxiety and high blood pressure medications can have a negative impact on libido as well. And, of course, women can experience a decline in libido without any of these things being involved. What's important is for women to consider all the possible causes before resorting to a risky, potentially hazardous, re packaged pharmaceutical that fizzled when it debuted the first time.
As for producing the text in the conscript, you have to find a text version of the book in the first place to do so, and then you have to spend some time formatting. That could be as simple as using a word processor, or it could be more in depth with something like LaTeX. Once it produced, if you then go the handmade bookbinding method, you have to format the print job. That depends entirely on the size of the pages you want   but for designing booklet style prints (typically used in hardcover bookbinding techniques), this little program/website is extremely helpful, as it will reconfigure a pdf file into one that can print according to the needs of the book style you are printing.

So, I would say in order of importance to raise Evocation to 7. Spells have a base damage, so you don need to scale their damage by ranking their element just yet. Next, raise Lore to 7. This will let you learn the Sandstorm spell. It has its own reagent, but it gives you some much needed AoE. It might not be a bad idea to learn Fireball at 4, but I unsure of its effectiveness. Next, raise Meditation to your level when the other two skills are ranked. You can fire magic off without mana, of course. Finally, raise your Air skill. This will increase the damage of your spells. I don believe you strictly need Death until much later on, where some monsters are resistant to Air. Repeat, again, for Lore 13 and Thunderstorm, but this time leave out Evocation as you already trained it as much as you need to.

Increased enzymatic degradation and cell death was also reported.Another study published also by Holm, PhD and Nachemson, MD (5) found that if dogs exercised a half hour a day for a period of three months, their discs exhibited increased synthesis of proteoglycans, increased transport rate of large molecules into the disc matrix, increased uptake of glucose, oxygen and glycogen, and increased aerobic metabolism.Overall, these findings indicated that spine should be subjected to adequate motion and exercise to ensure adequate supply to the joints and discs. Prolonged bed rest and/ or traction has a proven deleterious effect. With its accompanying fluid flow and variations in creep deformation, were necessary to preserve the nutritional status of discs and joints.These studies are consistent with a larger body of evidence that has evaluated the clinical effects of bed rest and immobility, both of which have been universally and thoroughly discredited as effective methods of treatment for both back and neck problems.Waddell, MD noted in 1987 (6) that there is a loss of 3% muscle strength per day with complete bed rest.The 1994 AHCPR guidelines on Acute Low Back Problems in Adults (7) warned about the potential complications of bed rest including a 1.0% to 1.5% loss of l muscle mass per day, as well as a 15% loss of aerobic capacity in 10 days.The very recently revised and released 1996 British guidelines (8) summarize the literature on bed rest, noting that there are now 9 randomized controlled studies on bed rest, and their findings confirm that bed rest is counter productive.Similarly, the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash Associated Disorders (9) confirmed that prolonged use of cervical collars probably prolongs disability.Today it is understood that motion plays a critical role in maintaining tissue and joint lubrication/nutrition for both discs and joint articular cartilage.We know that articular cartilage receives its nutrition through the circulation of synovial fluid, which is a filtrate derived from blood vessels within the synovial membrane.In addition, the synovial membrane also contains lymphatic ducts, which provide the pathway for the removal of waste products out of the synovial fluid and the joint space.What is essential to recognize is that the synovial fluid has absolutely no inherent capacity to circulate is no heart forcefully pumping synovial fluid to the joints.

Old minis can still be used in the game. This is a lot easier if they still the same size and general shape of the newer stuff.

Edit to add some life pro tips: Make sure your prep drink is cold, hold your nose when you drink it, and use a straw. Those three things should reduce the smell/taste by 95%.

Future research should test whether these effects contribute to the therapeutic effects in clinical populations.Creative thinking and empathy are crucial for everyday interactions and subjective well being. Anecdotal reports and recent studies suggest that a single administration of psilocybin can enhance such processes and could therefore be a potential treatment.

No doubt there is some serious and useful information in this little undated (ca. 1945/6) pamphlet mostly I guess its purpose was fulfilled in its attempt at softening the dread of nuclear holocaust in that there was actually something that could be "done" in the event of an attack. addresses the standard fears, and perhaps the standard fears of hope, though the pamphlet does paint a profile of possibility for a post attack scenario that is, shall we say, a little optimistic. any event, I share this now for the graphics, and the Manhattan Destroyed map. (The first published map of the rings of destruction of an atomic bomb any city of so far as I can tell appeared in the great PM newspaper the day after Hiroshima, showing what sort of effects the bomb would have on a profile not of Hiroshima, but of Manhattan. a matter of fact the entire issue of the ad free newspaper was devoted to the bombing, Hiroshima receiving more (and better) coverage than in any newspaper reporting I have seen in the first week after the bomb was dropped.

An "ace" is a fighter pilot who shoots down 5 enemy aircraft during aerial combat. Each country had a slightly different set of rules for claiming an enemy aircraft "kill". For example, the rule may require that another pilot or person on the ground witness the event. commands also credited aircraft destroyed on the ground as equal to aerial victories. Soviets distinguished between solo and group kills, as did the Japanese. The Allies (US) began to mount gun cameras on the aircraft that could help confirm an enemy aircraft shot down. Of course, if the enemy a/c dove out of the camera range before exploding then it was still in doubt. During World War 1, the "Blue Max" was awarded to German pilots upon downing 8 enemy aircraft. That number was later raised, so that a pilot became an "ace" first and then later received the Blue Max. Also in World War 1, some pilots would fly solo sorties. So, to ensure they would get credit for an enemy aircraft, sometimes they landed and cut the tail number off of the downed aircraft in order to validate their claim. Appendix German "aces" were called "experts" or Experten. Only single air victories were attributed (and only if somebody else could affirm it). This is a "by the way." remark. E.

Now you definitely made a mistake on the flop you can never flat in this situation because there are wayyyy too many cards that fuck you on the turn and your opponent is showing you he strong by raising like he did.

You have to jam flop here every single time.

This country is built off the foundation of injustice, it only serves the rich and kills the poor. This country is the land of the free for rich people, this is the best country in the world to live in if you're filthy rich. This country is built for white collar criminals to fuck over the heart of this country. The USA is a joke, it's not 1 in anything. No one is happy here, I've never met s person who isn't stressing out about finances all day. I've never met a person who is genuinely comfortable in life, I've never met a person who is hopeful for themselves. The country revolves around working yourself to death, no one ever talks about simply living and enjoying life. If you're not working 100 hours a week you're a lazy sack of shit. People think they're a few months away to being ultra mega rich without realizing that that will NEVER happen. What is the american dream in this country is the regular standard of life in every single other first world country. People never truly live their lives in the US, everyones sole focus is money and their jobs. I moved go the US several years ago and it's the biggest and first thing I noticed. It's so unbelievably sad that americans choose to live their lives this way, it's so sad they never realize that they're in a death trap. This country has the potential for so much, yet half the population is actively supporting the demise of this nation.

The dm and players checking their phones and twitch chat, or having cross table conversations made things drag during the combat.

I don't have the answers as to how we stop it, but based on history simply "demonizing" or banning does nothing. 
Your big men are anchoring your blocks and fg, but they are horrid assist assets. In general, assists and TO, as well as assists and FG/Blocks are negatively correlated. I think with Payton coming back, it'll help a bit, but I would try and move one of maybe Giannis or Randle for another assist heavy player and just punt TO. Really focus on dominating Fg, rebounds, stocks, and assists. Just my two cents but good luck! Solid team! I'm jealous, I'm also in a 14 team league and would be terrified of your team with a few tweaks!

In different Australian states and territories, the return rates are somewhere between 85 and 90 per cent.

You lauded the economic benefits of being able to deport people to maintain low wages. I would imagine those people wouldn talk about how much they benefit. If you are of thr opinion that markets should have no moral limits then I doubt there is any point in continuing this debate. I live in a country which has decided that it would prefer that consumer protection agencies, health boards and unions should advocate and enforce protections from market forces willing to make profits at virtually any cost. Lacking these things most economies will smile in the face of 8 year olds working under cotton gins, or selling products with known fatal flaws.

Facebook needs Zynga to keep those users active on its network. would make no sense for Zynga to try to recreate Facebook social graph, Werbach notes. the same time, Zynga success has been a huge boon to Facebook, both directly and indirectly. The two companies need each other. motives are clear: Become the leading social gaming company. In a letter to potential shareholders on July 1, Zynga CEO and co founder Mark Pincus said the company was founded on the belief that like search, share and shop would become one of the core activities on the Internet. But Facebook has exclusive access to some of Zynga most popular games under a deal that runs through 2015. As a result, Zynga cannot diversify the distribution points of its strongest games.

This is quarter horse country, where horses bred for quick bursts of speed are sold at periodic auctions. It is oil country, with scores of pumps grazing like metal horses in every direction. Oil money built most of the magnificent mansions on upper crust Kings Road. It is also a factory town. The gray turrets of the Evergreen feed mill tower only a block from Main Street like the superstructure of a battleship. The Brockway factory, a few blocks away, forges 1.3 million bottles and jars a day for Coke, Pepsi, and Gerber Baby Foods, among others. Blue Bell jeans employs 175 local women to sew 45,000 pairs of Wranglers and Rustlers a week. Ideal cement is produced in the town, as are Solo plastic cups. The Burlington Northern Railroad track slices diagonally across Main Street, several freights a day shrieking to a halt in the innards of the feed mill.
This is annoying and disappointing, especially because he was as transparent as possible throughout this entire fiasco, and had been nothing but transparent and prompt throughout the entire run of mountain poker. While other club owners were greedy and uncaring of their members, stixx was seen as one of the "good ones". I put $180 into mountain poker and was owed $600, which I doubt I ever see. I figured him being a moderator of this subreddit would keep him accountable, but in retrospect that was a silly assumption. Good luck everyone in getting your money back!

A pregnant woman's body even undergoes certain changes in the third trimester to prepare it for labor pains. Especially during the last 18 days of pregnancy, a soon to be mother's pain threshold elevates as pain mitigating opioid receptors go on red alert and levels of pain reducing hormones spike [source: Toomey]. In fact, even after the baby is born, a mother will continue to demonstrate a higher pain tolerance than women who haven't had children, according to a 1992 study from the University of Western Ontario [source: Hapidou and DeCatanzaro]..

Now it's time to put points on those stories. Personally I use the Poker Planning Scale (1/2,1,2,3,5,8,13,20,40,100) so this is what I will use for this example. At the bottom of that list you'll probably have micro tasks (things that takes 4 hours or less to do). 
As someone who also wet themselves because a teacher denied them the bathroom (and I was the most meek, timid, shy kid ever so I wasn't a problem kid), I feel terrible for that girl. Why not just punish the girl who was dicking around? Group punishments have been proven to be counterproductive. And the fact that she asked, accepted your answer, suffered 10 more minutes, then asked again and told you it was an emergency and you said no because you thought you knew her bodily needs better than her? That's pretty egregious..

Pronouns aren really in the Japanese language, sure there are different ways to say "I" (the closest thing we can get to a pronoun in Japan) but it not really restricted to any gender, woman can and do use boku/ore even when it usually men who use it, and men can use watashi even tho it can just be women who usually use it. (btw I think iirc I saw someone saying Rin was using Boku). There also the  chan/kun thing.  Chan is usually used for girls but it can just as easily be used for boys, vice versa for  kun (which is usually used for boys, but can easily be put on a girls name too). So basically the "Is" and "chan/kun" can give you an idea on a gender but it not 100% concrete assigned to one gender. Japan really doesn care about assigning gender pronouns. Erica scolds them for not realizing Rin was male. Vincent asks if Rin is an Otokono (which is specifically and ONLY referred to male crossdressing as female, and again "The concept of otokonoko does not directly correspond to a particular sexual identity or gender identity. Otokonoko may be of any sexual orientation."), and Rin agrees. So that three characters using male identifying language, and one of them is the character in question them self.
