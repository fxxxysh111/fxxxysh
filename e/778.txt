I don think there is one single experience, but every time I return to Singapore I feel as though I am coming back to my second home only this home is tropical and humid, not wet and miserable like London! In terms of pure one off experiences, visiting Sigiriya in Sri Lanka was awesome; Cappadocia in Turkey was brilliant; the temples of Bagan in Myanmar were mesmerising; the Roman ruins in Italy were fascinating; and the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, Japan,ranks up there, too.

There isn't any kind of universal certification for day spas (though there are usually state licensing requirements). Just because a place calls itself a day spa doesn't mean it's going to have the specific services you're looking for. Most day spas have a selection of services listed with the price for each, which is generally referred to as "the menu." Call ahead or stop in and go over the menu before you schedule an appointment. have certain licensing requirements for them. Typically, these require spa owners (and possibly employees) to pass background checks, submit the spa to regular health inspections, and ensure that any medical procedures are performed by trained and licensed individuals. Your state attorney general's Web site is usually to go to place for this kind of information. You can also ask spa staffers about them about it once you arrive there.

I see Jackson reputation as an accused pedophile as a product of pre 90s ignorance. I remember as a child my parents use to think affeminent gay men were child molester. They warn me to stay aways from certain people. Somehow in their brain, a man who is dainty and acts affeminent likes penis. ANY penis. They no longer believe this and have no issue with gay people today, but in the 90s it was a fairly common perception. Jackson got that label and no one thought to rethink their perception of Jackson as the cultural perception of affeminent men changed.
Most importantly, hit your shots. Know the strength of your weapons and what works best for you. Some have a crazy spread, some are on point all the time. try to use all the weapons and see what you like best. a purple p90 can eliminate a 100/100 player in 1 second if they put the muzzle next to your skull. That key too, shoot and move, use cover, and RELOAD after every time you shoot. nothing worse than clicking and having nothing come out. What works well for me is getting right next to them, they take too long too adjust their weapon and you really can miss from that far away.

To that end, I look best in skinny jeans and short or pencil skirts and in tighter tops that accentuate my waist. Things have to be paired up properly or you go from accentuating a feature to trying too hard very quickly. Skimpy clothes don draw the kind of attention you want.

I would never allow a member of my staff to use their own personal servers or email when dealing with national security. I think this is very irresponsible of Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama. I think she should be held accountable for the possibility that she could be trading insider secrets to another country. We impeached Richard Nixon for less than what Hillary Clinton has done.

It saddens me that only days after President Clinton met with Lynch that the FBI has this position. It only creates a bigger doubt in the minds of Americans. I don believe Mrs. Clinton should be using air force one for transportation nor should she be allowing secret meetings between her husband and anyone in this administration. It shows favoritism that should never be allowed when one is running for President.

In Swat, Dir and parts of Buner our army has suffered heavy casualties. If the US military had suffered a quarter of these casualties in the two months or so since the Swat operation started, there would have been a storm in Washington. But since it is Pakistan's 'peasant' army suffering these losses it is a different matter altogether. Washington, however, is not to blame. If we remain chumps when it comes to bargaining with the US, the fault is not in our stars but us. Other countries will not put a proper value on us or what we do unless we first put a proper value on ourselves. If we go about with hangdog looks, our leaders ever so grateful for the smallest attention they get, we shouldn't be surprised if others treat us like a doormat.

Right now we in a drought and the sub visits vs subscribers numbers show that.Another thing is that the questions should have straight yes or no options without this ranking thing. It was confusing to figure out.I avoided asking this in a public thread because I didn want any to deal with any tumblr style downvote mobs or lynchings, but is there a reason why Pokemon arts and crafts aren their own sub?I mentioned this in the survey thing before the vote was held, but I stated that in my opinion, the majority of threads in any sub should be discussion threads and it looked like every other Pokemon subject has that except for arts and crafts.[M]  10 points  submitted 21 days agoThanks for all of this!

That depends on the kinds of players in the blind. Generally, I don steal against unknowns, which means if I steal I expecting those players to usually fold to a preflop raise. Since they didn their range is probably stronger than mine, so I won often continue unless the flop looks particularly strong for a typical steal range.. 
These are just a few of the means of dislodging your business from the rut into which so many once successful businesses have now fallen.

2. The odds the pot is offering you are 3 to 1. In all likelihood, your opponent holds an ace or a king, so making a pair will not help. Your only hope is making a straight. Therefore, you have only 4 outs (the 4 queens). This makes the odds 10.8 to 1 that you will hit your hand. This is an easy fold.

Surprise, surprise, this has a habit of happening after he loses a pot of course. Eventually I couldn't listen to him any more. After making derogatory comments about the dealer for the second hand in a row, I tried to explain that the dealer had no control over what appears on the flop. (and none of us would want to play in a game where they had !). As usual my timing was off, and Phil blew his top. The self proclaimed best player in the world, was now proclaiming to the whole room that he was more of a man than I'll ever be, and that goading someone after losing a pot was totally un excusable. And I hadn't even realised I was goading him. Well I was speechless (honest guv, I was lost for words). This was one of those times when American and English were completely different languages again. I honestly had no idea what planet he was coming from. There are definitely some major cultural differences here. I went to bed on a little bit of a downer for the first time since I arrived.

This understanding of the minstrel show makes sense when we put it alongside that other great form of American pop culture, the Freak Show. According to Rosemarie Garland, the Freak Show was part of the democratic process since it provided a way for all Americans, even the recently arrived immigrants or the recently migrated Black Americans, to go to places like Coney Island and feel that they were the "normal" and the "good" Americans, not some Freaks.

Many sites offer seventy five, eighty and ninety number bingo. There is also Speed Ball and Lucky Number Bingo to add variety to the playing experience.
These sites allow you to watch pros play, view tutorials on every aspect of the game, and hear breakdowns of how players (good players!) think through hands.

Self immolation is a method of suicide by lighting oneself on fire.

But they have it backward. Improve living conditions and security will improve. Focus on security at the expense of humanitarian goals, and coalition forces will accomplish neither.

I pushed for 15 minutes and she came right out. It was incredible! She was born super healthy but only weighed 4 lbs 6 ozs. Don't be scared and remember your body can handle anything.

We called in our friend Kris, who was a native speaker, to verify before we told her what it actually meant.He took one look at her paper with her carefully copied characters and blurted out "Slut?!".Yep. "Educated woman" had a completely different connotation, apparently, in Japanese.I expected her to be shocked but, instead, her eyes lit up.

If you want your best chance of winning money, play poker. In casino style poker, you aren playing against the casino, so the game isn rigged against you (meaning all the players theoretically have the same chance of winning). The casino makes it revenue from poker by taking a rake (a small percentage of every pot) so no one at the table has an inherent advantage over another.. 
Your struggle has meaning to it, and behind all these emotions lies a deeper truth, lies deeper wisdom, that can only be discovered by experiencing them for the full value they have to offer, and expressing those feelings.

The question essentially means the same as "What is the chance to get a flush if dealt 7 cards?" This is because from the view of one player in hold'em they will simply get 7 cards, 2 pocket cards plus 5 community. If I trust my sampling program it says a flush occurs 3.02% of the time. What we're looking for are the number of permutations which create a flush. The first card can be anything, thus 52 options, then the next four cards must be of the same suit, so 12, 11, 10, and 9 options. The last two cards can again be anything, so 47 and 46 options. These is just one permutation, the ordering can be done (6c2) = 15 ways. Then divide these permutations by the total number of 7 card permutations to get our answer: 5212111094746  (6c2) / (52515049484746) = 0.297 .

Thanks for the elaboration, but I don really see the allegory here. They used the word Marijuana at the same time as they conducted racist speech. This is not the same as adopting a symbol and having it represent racism. And unless I missed something, the word itself doesn seem to be created to convey a racist worldview (in contrast to say, "Negermusik", the Nazi German term for Jazz). I understand that the word was used and popularized by someone who was promoting racism, but I just don see how this actually leads to the word having "Racist roots".

I do agree with him that massage and movement therapy doesn always address the root core of the pain problem. Some LMT are mostly improving circulation or providing temporary relief of the tension/pain. Yet there are many massage therapists who do treat the root cause. In my opinion, these practitioners are helping clients heal from old emotional wounds. Whether the LMT would explain it that way or not, that is how I see it. It not psychotherapy   but it is touching people in such a way that they feel "touched" or "seen" and they are then able to let go of the physical tension that has been holding in their emotional pain. Sometimes tears of joy, sadness, grief, etc come through and sometimes not. The lack of tears are not a sign that emotional healing has not occurred.

Research pertaining to mechanisms underlying the effects of exercise on brain function has focused on changes in neurotransmitters, neurotrophins and vasculature [5]. Specific to the hippocampus, a brain area important for learning and memory, is the robust increase in new neurons with exercise [30]. The beneficial effects of running on cognition could be mediated, at least in part, by enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis [30,47]. Elucidation of effects of nutrition on the brain, by contrast, has concentrated on the antioxidant and neuroprotective aspects of various dietary supplements. More recent work, however, indicates that diet might exert direct effects on neuronal signaling [42]. The effects of diet and exercise could be additive and/or synergistic through activation of common intracellular pathways.

The persistence of the memory of pain that can last beyond its beneficial function has led to research into ways of alleviating chronic pain. Research has shown that the best way to thwart chronic pain is to prevent pain memories from forming in the first place. Anesthesia prevents the conscious mind from forming pain memories during a purposeful injury like surgery. Yet, the nervous system can still form its own pain memories. Medical professionals are finding that analgesics   drugs that prevent pain in the nervous system   given to patients before surgery prevent chronic formation of pain memory, which diminishes the development of chronic pain later on [source: Ackerman].

Seated Overhead Press: Sit on the ball with correct posture (stomach tight, shoulders back, head up, back straight, and hips directly beneath you) and push a weight from shoulder level to above your head. Your back should stay flat during the movement and if you have to significantly increase the curve in your low back, you are using too much weight. The benefit of using an exercise ball is that your abdominals and back muscles will activate to keep the spine in a neutral position while the lower body muscles work to keep your hips stationary. All of these muscle activations will strengthen your core muscles.

Well no he not "wrong"   unless you talking about specific things about white nationalism which are completely debatable. ryan changed his mind on the genetic mesh and the inevitability of white nationalism   however even after his two videos saying he a first worldist or whatever he expressed skepticism, as even though he disassociated, he still cares about and corrects the strategies of white nationalists   such as his hour and a half long video on JF gariepy. and this is funny because you just dismiss his work, even though this stunt proves that he follows the data and is willing to take a beating from his audience over it. ryan and sean simply found data that seems to disprove the ability for white nationalism to win, as whites are not politically exceptional and will continue to vote democrat under conditions which marginalize them as a group

But the burka is singled out as particularly oppressive to women because part of the justification for the war in Afghanistan was the liberation of women. This lie sold to us by the Bush administration and actually believed by some major feminist organizations should be seen for what it is: a racist justification for invasion.

When you calculate that you have a +EV play (even if it something like getting 4 to 1 with 25% equity and you closing the action) you should take it. You losing EV if you don seems simple, but there are more factors. How tilted are you going to get if you make a correct pot odds call (but still likely to lose the hand) and then lose the pot? What if you are currently up and this would make you down for the session? How important is it to you to book a win on any given session? I would argue that if you can look past all of these factors and still stick to maximizing EV you have an even bigger edge over the people who are concerned about this other stuff..
