You'll learn that not every hand that has a card with a letter on it is a powerhouse worth playing.

EDIT: I would love to hear some counterpoints from the downvoters. To be clear, I am standing by my original claim that it is possible for a poker player to conceivably identify and take a GTO line in the majority of spots; and I concede the point that playing GTO 100% of the time is impossible because completely solving the game (and therefore truly playing GTO) is impossible. But through intense study of enough decision trees the approximations of GTO lines are close enough to enable a player to reach this level of play.

I worked as a bartender at an "upscale" restaurant for about a year. It was the kind of place where pharmaceutical sales reps would bring a group of doctors to give them a sales pitch. There was one doctor who somehow managed to get on a lot of invite lists. And every single time she was there, she get falling down drunk on the rep tab (seriously, she once fell down the stairs). As the person who name was on the "Person in Charge" sign, this was a problem for me. I would cut her off, she would become nasty, and my boss would over ride my decision. I started pulling the reps aside before the events that she was on the list for and telling them that "it would be better to limit everyone to two drinks each." That lasted about two events before she started demanding more drinks and the reps relented, probably to keep her from ruining their presentation. We finally started cutting her wine with cranberry juice and water after the first or second one. Since she was already getting the "bartender special blend" (whatever reds had been opened the longest) she never realized. Or at least never said anything.

Because handguns are easier to use, easy to conseal, lightweight, you can more easily find compatible ammo, magazines, and even carry several magazines in your pockets, they are very easy to reload quickly, and many have as many bullets in a mag as a legal rifle magazine. Also anyone who says that dual weilding pistols is impossible or even all that impractical is wrong. They are more accurate that one would think, easy to fix in the field, easier to suppress with items simply found around us, they are often not as loud as a rifle, and certainly quieter than a shotgun, they do not have a short range, they are honestly harder to fumble or drop, less recoil means faster refire while retaining a general ammount of accuracy, and 9mm (the most common pistol round) can penetrate most surfaces at close range.

With blinds at 5,000/10,000, Feldman raised to 35,000 under the gun and I looked down at 10 10 in the big blind. Having 180,000 in chips at the time, my standard play would be to reraise all in, or at least raise it up to 110,000 to go. But playing against the aggressive Feldman, I wanted to slow it down and give him the chance to bluff off his money to me.

Nigga (without the hard r; the term with the r enunciated is almost exclusively a racially charged insult) is a term that many black people refer to themselves as, similar to "guy" or "dude".

Considering the fact that child labor was still common and legal in pretty much all jobs at the time, it not surprising that his mother and step father would have considered his earnings to be theirs. If you send your kid out to get a job in a factory, you use it for the support of the family so it belongs to the adults to use as they see fit. I think they were wrong in what they did especially considering they pretty much squandered all of the money he made, but there was no idea then that children had a right to any money they earned until after child labor was strictly regulated and the law that bears his name was enacted.

I pray that my husbands body will be filled with the holy spirit and not alcohol. Lord I know that in and of myself I am not able to break free of this destructive habit and ask that in Your grace and mercy You would help me to be set free of this ungodly addiction. All you need to do is access the wholeness that is already yours through prayer and meditation on the scriptures. Literally every one Friday, Saturday and sometimes even on Sunday. And Lord for those that are not believers   we ask that in Your grace You would convict them of their damaging behaviour, both in their own bodies and in the lives of those that they know and love, and turn them away from alcohol addiction to a right relationship with the Lord Jesus   in Whose name I pray, Amen Heavenly Father, thank You for helping me along the way to recovery from my addiction to alcohol. When his work is toilsome, pray for endurance and perspective. Lead me to the right church and Christian friends who can support me in this journey, in Jesus Name, Amen We know that you will need to have some support as you are going through this process so you will need to where you can be accountable to other believers in Christ and a pastor.

Also GTO will not give the most optimal result in every individual situation. For example, say in a game of heads up poker, you notice your opponent will call any bet you make on the river once he checks to you. This means you can wait until you have a strong hand and just bomb it. This will win you a lot of money, however, the strategy is exploitable. Your opponent can change his mind and now he choses also to fold, call and raise and now he wants to and is able to exploit you back. In the short run, whilst your opponent isn aware of his horrible play, it is more +EV to adopt a strategy that can be exploited in the future. However, I argue that is very easy to implement a GTO strategy in a heads up sit n go with effective stacks under 20BB.

Some analysts put their tactics down to "lunacy", others to irrationality. But this gambit was far more rational than most commentators realised. It reminded me of Richard Nixon's well concocted madman strategy to make the Vietnamese think he was crazy enough to blow up their dykes or even drop the big one. It was a well calculated fear tactic, a shrewd manoeuvre in a game of psychological warfare.
I really only "white knight" for recreational players or friends at the table because I don like getting involved in other people business and I also believe it up to players to learn to stick up for themselves, but I do speak up and I hope others speak up when extremely gender targeted and sexist stuff gets thrown around even vs female regs.

Thanks for this reply; i feel the same as you and OP, yet there is generally nothing "wrong" with my life and i truly have so much to be grateful for. So, whenever i talk to people about how i feel, they tell me "well i wish my life was "x, y, and z" like yours! What they don understand is none of it truly matters if i am incapable of feeling enjoyment. I have been off and on antidepressants and other psych meds since i was 12  I 32 now. Haven been on an antidepressant in over 3 years, and I afraid to start one back up again because most of them did absolutely nothing for me, and the ones that did, had horrendous side effects. Wellbutrin is what has helped me the most  with little to no side effects  and I asked my doctor twice now to be put back on it, but he isn comfortable doing so because I already on adhd meds and he says it "like a cousin to them" or something. I been on both ADHD meds and Wellbutrin in the past, and had no problems tho! Maybe he thinks it will cause a manic episode tho, since I am bipolar as well.

The real question on this one is, has this dude donked with TP or better? If this was a drawee board or a low board, you might think that he donked to protect his TP type hand and take value of draws, but this is not a drawee board and its not a low board. If he has TP, the only reason he is betting is for value, and would he really bet here for value off an 8 or worse?! I think he be more likely to check and let you bluff.

The Middle Stages are usually ushered in by the big difference between the biggest stacks and the smallest ones especially after the first or two hours. At this stage, the stack size turns out to be the most important thing in influencing what hands a player can play against which opponents.

The Golden Donk   Plays horribly and always gets there. 4 bet ships 88 over an 8 BB 3 bet from the tightest player at the table for 12 BBs and spikes the 8 vs. AA/KK/QQ to win.

Believes poker is a skill game and that he is the best player in the tournament.
For instance if you are getting in 500 bbs on the river in a 4b preflop pot with JT on AAKQT board you are making serious errors as opposed to getting 100bbs in preflop with AKs vs JJ and losing on a QJTT2 runout.

My understanding is that another problem with hadiths are that Muslims have no agreed upon leader.

Which allows for virtually any interpretation of the material. 
Fortunately, these poker bots may not be a threat for long. But you might think, why should these poker rooms care, since poker bots make as much money for them as real people do?

Flatpak might be a better alternative (it allows multiple repositories), but it works by "bundling" dependencies (so generally speaking, an app will have to download and store dependencies it might never need), which increases download time, bandwidth demands, and needed disk space (and will have a higher environmental/carbon footprint ). This is probably done at least in part to make it easier for proprietary developers to package their app.

Hair loss may occur as part of an underlying disease, like lupus erythmatosis or type two diabetes. If the thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, hair may fall out and treating thyroid disease will help remedy this. Hypothyroidism can cause it too, especially the thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows..

Non Turnover RevenueAlthough much of your company's revenue will probably be generated by turnover of products through sales, you can also bring in revenue through other channels, such as services. If you run a massage business, the work you do doesn't really deplete any asset that needs to be replenished, or turned over. If your company earns interest or royalty income, these sums also have little to do with turnover..

He treated you for two hours. thats not even an option here where i am. If you feel you are not appropriately draped, you also should speak up. From personal experience, you cannot relax and reap the benefit of the massage if you think your breast, groin, etc is hanging out for all the world to see. We really want you to be comfortable with us and it makes our jobs easier if you are relaxed (if you're comfortable, you rebook too!). It's strange that he was pretty decent with draping the first few times. Draping properly and securely takes no time at all.

There have already been a few other cold cases solved where police had DNA of the suspect that they submitted to a popular ancestry site and waited. Then eventually someone in the suspect family does one of those tests and it links them as potential family. There is a case going on in Iowa right now where they did that and then collected DNA from the suspect again to see if it was a match. 
My daughter paternal grandmother insists, still to this day, on being called "grand mommy". Because she was not old enough to be a grandmother either.

ECT is a last resort treatment. Informed consent should obviously include discussion of risks, and any provider not fully explaining those risks deserves to have their malpractice premiums go up. Good, go sue them, I applaud that. That said, what is the point of your AMA? To get some attention? To drum up business? To scare people by inaccurately using fancy sounding terms and trying to create the appearance of a conspiracy? I assure you, there is no ECT conspiracy. Those who treat with ECT are the very ones trying to come up with new treatment options that don't carry the same risks.

The whole point of using a heavy bag is because it heavy (yep) and it swings. You need to hit with a rhythm and learn to weave in strikes on a moving target. In a real fight, your opponent is not just going to stand there and let you string in a combo on them.

Educate yourself! Learn how to recognize when you are being manipulated. Learn how to spread that education to your family and friends. I suggest you you read "A People's History of The United States". It will change your life.
It will always depend on how the game itself is made, but it incredibly unlikely that this would be a huge undertaking. Of course, they would have to consider user experience and UI involved with choosing these options, so the effort is not minimal, but being able to have separate appearances per client should never be an issue.
The two minute ad from Procter Gamble's razor brand shows men and boys engaging in bullying and sexual harassment and encourages men to "say the right thing" and "act the right way." Taking on bullying, sexual harassment and toxic masculinity is a big task for a razor brand. Many critics took to social media saying it was insulting to men and laden with stereotypes.

They started about 170 big blinds deep and given that the hand was 4 bet preflop, there really is no other line given his stack to pot ratio after the flop but to eventually stack off with his hand here. Its very unlikely that a hand like AJ would have taken this line from his opponent, and even a hand like JJ rarely takes this line. If his opponent did do something bizarre and spazzy, the natural play is to check call and allow a spazzy opponent to bluff the rest of the chips off on the turn whereas raising will just give the opponent a chance to fold his bluffs..

The first episode of 'Little Things' season one is an inch close to fetching 10 million views on YouTube. Season 2 of the 'Dice Media' owned intellectual property is streaming on Netflix. While the show being on a global platform like Netflix is a landmark moment for any content creator anywhere in the world, it would be unfair to attribute it as the defining moment for Pocket Aces. The digital content house reached millions of eyeballs before associating with the streaming giant. "We became experts at creating mobile first content by understanding our consumers. We never said these are clips, we did not chop films. We said audiences are picking up the phone about 20 times a day for five minutes at a time.

My family did not become vegetarian, but they are keen of trying things out and are really supportive. I often times eat in our uni cafeteria or in restaurants, but when I am eating at home they always make a vegetarian alternative to the meat component or a fully vegetarian meal.

This might sound a little harsh, but you need to get off your  and start doing the everything you know needs to be done, in order to get where you want to be. You need to start doing things that you don't want to, or don't like, in order to get somewhere. Just get focused, and forget about the pain, and how hard it will be. Also I would recommend books by Larry Winget. I read a book, by him, called "You are Broke Because You Want to Be".

Another disagreement I have with Gillian Flynn. In the book, Camille says she never saw or heard from Richard again after he found out she was a cutter, but that just not possible. He would have to testify that he found the poisons, that he took Camille and Amma blood to the lab for testing and that he read Marian and Amma medical records. He would testify that the 2 nurses suspected MBP and the nurses would testify too. He would have to testify at Amma trial that he found the pliers, as well as any other pieces of evidence that he uncovered. Of course Camille would have to testify in both trials as well. He could have refused to talk to Camille at the trials, but he definitely would have seen her.

Just make sure you understand what you're actually signing.

2) I eat big and small shields as soon as I can and always prioritize at least one if not 2 slots to healing. Also, hybrid potions are the best because they will restore 25 to both health and shield, so if you have 4 you can get to 100/100 in about 25 seconds, but you CANNOT stack them, you have to let them fully heal you, then pop another one. If you drink them on top of each other you do not get the full benefit.

Then players take turns playing cards, attempting to score points by playing particular combinations and adding up the face values of the cards (face cards count for ten). This is called "pegging". The final phase of the hand is "the show", in which players show their hands and score points based on different combinations of cards such as sums of fifteen, runs, flushes, and pairs.The rules of the game are a little tricky to learn, but you have the hang of it after a couple of rounds.

To reverse roles let take a fitness class my wife was doing which was exotic dancing I don think it specified anywhere it was ladies only but I could see a man showing up making some of the women uncomfortable even if he was the most polite, well behaved man out there.
