Agree with badRLplayer. His examples are incredibly superficial. I would argue PGH has done an incredible amount of damage to the diversity of roles women are seen as capable of succeeding in. My wife (korean) fumes at how her incompetence or failure is at times portrayed as being related to her gender, often as an excuse put forth by her own ultraconservative supporters. I would argue that she was chosen almost entirely based on her connection to her father, rather than due to her quite meager legislative accomplishments prior to becoming president. So I believe her legacy is damaging to women who want to achieve in Korea through their hard work and ability.

The entire BSOP was meant to wrap up on Tuesday, but Neymar Jr. had a wedding to attend that night (he was the best man, so it was kind of a big deal). In a great act of fair play, the other eight players unanimously decided to extend the High Roller by a day, and once that player decision was made the BSOP generously offered to cover all extra expenses, including hotel rooms and flight changes.

Bulk buying your own book doesn work. book clubs) do, but you can 100% bank on that unless you have an existing platform or connections at Oprah/Reese Witherspoon/other celebrity book club influencers. Because we were all friends first, the atmosphere never gets contentious or braggy, and we tend to get really invested in each other projects and characters.

My current working strategy, which has produced about 90% winning sessions over the last six months, is that folding is a home game player's best friend and that it only takes a couple of big hands to make the night profitable. Generally, in the home game, the majority of players cannot control their impulses and cannot fold hands that normal poker players would always fold. Taking advantage of this fact is one, crucial way to win consistently, and a way to keep losses under control when luck starts working against you, which it will..

I consider intelligence/brain power in whatever defined form to be the most 'powerful' of all variables in evolution, regardless of the animal.
