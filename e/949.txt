So, one day after work, I was heading to the car with my props and cash box under my arms. Momentarily forgetting the wisdom of Batman, I made the wrong decision to take a shortcut through an alleyway when a junkie jumped out and made a move for the cash box. Unfortunately, unlike the time David Copperfield was almost robbed but used his training to convince the robber he had nothing in his pockets, my guy already had my money in his hands, leaving me no other choice but to wrestle him for it.

Whittle's approach to teaching is to avoid prepared lectures. Instead, believing that heat generates light, the professor provokes students to debate opinions. "He rarely offered his own view, even when the controversy rose to a fever pitch. His goal was to make his flock think for themselves."

To end my 4am missive here, we are currently training some amazing new mods. They are going to make mistakes. It's part of the learning process. I remember many mistakes I made back then. I still accidentally stick my foot in it sometimes! When your comments are removed they are not deleted. They are still visible to just yourself and the mods of the sub they came from. If, like I mentioned above you have a carefully thought out comment that has been removed, chances are that there's something in there that if you try modmailing us first, and if that's not going through for you (trust me, I feel your frustration there) if you politely reply to the removal comment asking if there's something you could edit, we'd generally be happy to work with you. Just like you, we'd like the OP's to benefit from as much input as is a available. To the best of our capabilities given what we have to work with, we do try to often follow the spirit of the rule, not the letter in every case.

Alternatively maybe each module is stored as a compressed file that can be verified and then unpacked for every run?

These days, poker is becoming mainstream. The nationally televised World Poker Tour, combined with celebrity poker events and national coverage of the World Series of Poker have added up to a surge in popularity for poker at the pro level. The World Series was once a small event hosted at Binion's Horseshoe in Las Vegas mainly to draw publicity. It featured a few of Benny Binion's friends in a Hold'em duel over a pile of chips. Now, thousands of people show up to watch and participate in the dozens of side tournaments, satellites, and ring games that surround the main competition. Anyone over the age of 21 can buy into the main event with $10,000. Many players have made their way in through satellite tournaments that cost much less to play and offer a seat in the main event as a prize.

See his interview with Chris Hayes (a self identified Bernie supporter) last week as an example. Didn we hate it that Trump supporters seemed to believe everything he boasted about during the election? How "he alone would fix it". Yet, aren Bernie supporters just a naive and gullible?

Honestly, America would be that kid who's parents are constantly fighting and, as a result, does wildly inconsistent in school   either academically or in sports   depending on how things are going at home that week.

Then sometimes America comes to school with dirty clothes, bullies other students, lashes out at teachers, and half asses everything.

They will ask men to pay for the happy ending before the massage starts. So I would guess someone could avoid this sting if they ensure that the masseuse is touching their penis before any discussion of happy endings occurs.a raid, the police will burst into a massage parlour and try to catch men having sex. I never been in a raid like this, but I imagine it would be hard to prove that a nude man getting a massage (even if sporting an erection) was actually getting a handjob when the police burst in.

Because of stressful everyday living, people instinctively yearn for relaxation therapy every now and then. Indeed, there is nothing more relaxing than stretching out on a comfortable bed with a well trained masseuse to take care of aching muscles and constricted veins.
Reality usually had a way of intervening. ButI knew one senior reporter who would play solitaire on his computer in the mornings, waiting for his editors to come through with marching orders.

D) I could care less about the belief system of past, present or future scientists as long as they of course practice the scientific method correctly, first and foremost. However I would be far more inclined to accept any further theoretical thinking that wasn necessarily based on empirical evidence from an Atheist scientist, than I would a modern Christian one. Agendas can be far reaching, and every now and again, have somewhat "tainted" results through History. Christians can and DO indeed make good scientists, particularly those who would purport to be politically inclined. Their intentions might lean more heavily toward tying their results to a deity or other agenda, rather than using results to give birth to freer, multi dimensional thinking.
Even if every country followed its promises (lol!), it would not be sufficient to reduce greenhouse gases to the level scientists claim are necessary to bring warming under control.

At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists' goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. 
It is said several times in the Scriptures that homosexuals have no place in the kingdom of God, Paul even included their sins in a list of sins that makes those who practice such deserving to die.

I think it because the role of mother is pretty esteemed in a lot of societies so the insult of their mother is like the worst insult. In Vietnamese,  m (in the north) and  m (in the south) means "fuck your mom" is one of if not the most insulting thing you can say to someone. I mean, in some cultures it can be used as a compliment like my BIL said that in the Black community, if you eat something good say like a a great peach cobbler, you would say, "This cobbler is slap your mom good." It is very bad to slap your mom but the cobbler is so good that you might do the unthinkable.
Ik ben inderdaad ook benieuwd, of ze echt geen pensioen heeft opgebouwd via een pensioenfonds.

This is just the first set of charges, and the remaining 10 counts of the first set can be retried because the jury was hung (I think).

China is dominating Africa in ways that King Leopold would have been jealous of. They are loan sharking the third world and then owning it. They are buying ports left and right, even setting up military coughresearchcough in Antarctica. They effectively own the Panama Canal (thanks jimmy carter) and are not a signatory to START, so their nukes are substantially more capable in the MIRV department than US nukes. The only thing stopping their worldwide influence is a strong USA. All they need is a weak or compliant US administration and they will be the worlds primary superpower. They stole the background checks for literally ever single person that ever had a security clearance and have intel services that are the best funded on earth.

There is a slangy saying that the game of poker is "all in the draw." While this is an exaggeration, it is not so very far from the truth. In the first place, it should be borne in mind that it is a duty each player owes to the game, his neighbors, and himself, to discard and draw quickly and decorously. 
How did Cynthia create hallucinations? She a computer right? Those things couldn have been projections, because there were scenes where several people that couldn see what one saw. So was it Thale?

No, it's not gonna happen. In what world is it a financially lucrative decision to give another anime season to a manga that is pretty much all but dead? Especially if you're only asking for an adaptation of the end of the RdC; you don't even want a full adaptation of the manga with what's happening right now. So how would a new season, as you envision it, help to boost volume sales in any meaningful way? Remember, that's the whole reason manga adaptations get made in the first place. RdC ended over 80 chapters ago, it's old news. There's no financial reason to adapt old material that probably won't even be enough to fill an 11 episode season.

My parents did something similar when I was a teen. My middle school aged cousin had a friend who was living in extreme poverty and his parents were serious drug addicts. My mom and dad went and bought the kid and his sister clothes, an Xbox, games, and a bunch of other stuff. Then we found out that their parents sold all of it for drugs.

I've never met one who has considered themselves "white" in the American context (Caucasian is separate issue because at that point, you can arguably fit all Middle Easterners and South Asians into that definition) and I have never heard anyone else call them "white" either, except for those weird census documents but those also consider Indians and East Asians as part of the same race, so not exactly credible. Even JoJo's mom, if I saw her walking down the street, my first guess would be a (mixed race) Latina, not white..

As a matter of fact playing video poker is rather simple, a lot simpler than playing a traditional game of poker. The rules are the same as in a live poker game, the hands are ranked the same, and the game play is pretty much the same. There are a few advantages though. First of all you can discard from your hand any cards that you do not want to keep. This will help you make up a stronger poker hand, one that has better chances of winning. And thus we come to another advantage that video poker offers: you will always get a payout. This of course depends on the strength of your poker hand.

But the entire premise of the "good guys" is entirely Machiavellian, even as the "bad guys" follow it as well. Kvothe conclusions are spurious and poorly grounded in logic, but the narrative handwaves these leaps very quickly so that you don see them. At the same time, we get hints that all is not as it seems in Kvothe view of the world. The kind Encanis vs the harsh priests. The unbending Iron Law vs Libertine Felurian. Even the double fudge earlier of Skarpi and one of the Adem using "The Enemy" rather than naming any figure. These all hint that Kvothe POV is wrong, even as he is completely convinced of his righteousness.

I didn want to completely ruin this man RuneScape career so I grabbed the black mask since he had 70 Slayer and the coin stack (I didn know how much it would be since runelite caps at 65k, it was 800k). I told him I leave the rest and he ran back from lumby to pick it up. Escorted him out of the wild and he gave me 1m off his main. It was less than I could have got from picking up the loot (5m) so I almost regret it but it was obviously worth a lot more to him than me

If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is rolled, you then win if the shooter rolls that number again before rolling a 7.

The house edge for craps is less than 2 percent with the best bets..

I truly and deeply believe that the most critical battlefield in the fight for gender equality is in childhood. It must be normal for boys and girls to play together, for them to play with toys that have previously been gendered, and to erase the gender divide that is established in childhood and that feeds into the rest of our teens and adult life..

This sort of conflation of gay sex and national security has been around for a long time, at least since the time of King Edward II, if not before. But what is different about making homosexuality a national threat now is the way post colonial narratives of liberation get married to older, colonial narratives of the White Man Burden, all in an age where the boundaries of the nation state are nearly meaningless since communication and actual humans traverse them with few impediments.

This, however, would require a different man in Washington than the smooth talker we have. Haqqani is a very clever man who has always put himself first. Anyone wishing to learn the timeless art of self promotion can do no better than learn at his feet. Too often he sounds like an American appendage, an extension of the State Department, no doubt an asset in American eyes but a bit of a liability for us. We need someone more in tune with the new realities emerging after the Pakistan Army's rethink about Swat, FATA and the threat from the Taliban, someone who can make a slightly different pitch, pander less to American prejudices and make out a better case for Pakistan than the peanuts packaged in the Kerry Lugar bill.

When he tries to talk to someone they talk back, he been able to shoot the shit about sports or TV or crazy gambling stories with some of the other regs, and when he butchers hands for stacks someone would reinforce him just by saying something really innocuous under their breath like "that so sick" as if it was some standard cooler.In which situation do you think the spot is more likely to keep playing?Also keep in mind that OP and I aren asking every reg to try to be the life of the party, but just to go out of their comfort zone a little bit to not be a noticeable detriment to the environment.

The average cost of breast augmentation is between $6000 and $8000 and nearly all boob jobs will have to be redone within 7 10 years because they will usually either bottom out, harden, leak, or in some way "fail." So most women will generally undergo several operations and cash outlays in the course of a lifetime if they want to have nice tits. In this way, boob jobs can often seem like a frivolous investment of one time and money.

Seriously. If you have not done hallucinogenic drugs before then you can begin to comprehend the idea of it. As soon as you have done them, you understand that your consciousness is just the simplest and most logical of possible hallucinations in the world and there exists (likely) a series of billions of other people walking around in some crazy bizarre reality that is almost identical to your understanding and not quite parallel to your actions..

I honestly can not tell if you are trolling, but if you are, then a hearty congratulations. You are doing a very good job of it. If not, then I am afraid that you are simply ignorant and unbelievably arrogant. Fallout 4 experimented with some new systems and was not what some people expected, but in no way was it a bad game. I agree that it would have been nice to be fully evil, but that is not a deal breaker. RPG stands for role playing game. It was perfectly possible to play a role in Fallout 4. And no, I have never played COD, nor had any desire to do so. That being said, I have nothing against the people who find enjoyment in COD.

Both of the weapons used by Lubke aircraft seem as though they would be devastating, and indiscriminate.

What context are you talking about? The British did systematically make it so, Irish peasants had but two choices, emigrate or starve to death! And how gracious we all should be that they were accepted on the shores or Britain lol. How foolish can you really be to believe you have some objective overview of our joined history?

If a hard border is erected here and people die because of it, is there a wiki page I can reference to solve things? Stop talking shite and just move on! If you want to have a grown up discussion, then take stock of realty lad. Britain has fucked Ireland for centuries and the single best thing to come from it all was the GFA, now being bent to breaking point by British government policies without a hint of consideration or empathy, so take a run and jump if you think anyone wants to hear your unapologetic analytical overview of how the Irish received your generous donations of aid during the famine you absolute ham!!

Afaik, the term "menhera" is japanese slang for yami kawaii which is some kind of fashion style meaning "sickly cute", not sure what up with that.
