"When it comes to homosexuality many African religious leaders view progressive social witness on LGBT equality as a 'Western agenda,'" Kaoma. "In many respects, their denunciation of homosexuality is an attack on the West rather than a statement about human sexuality." That's one reason the anti gay rhetoric prevalent in Africa often resembles modern European anti Semitism: gay people, like Jews, are seen as subversive, foreign, and enervating, threatening the nation's unity and virility..

Fame brings a lot of envy and anger, and /u/GallowBoob is definitely famous on the site. The thing that makes his situation different from that of a real world celebrity is that his entire audience (including his critics) all have an equal amount of access, along with a lot of opportunities to spread lies.

ALL  Up until August of 1957, I do not remember ever having played a card game for money. This had nothing to do with morals. I had been an undergraduate mathematics major at Harvard, going as far as getting a Master degree before switching to theoretical physics.

Better to go to a movie.

If the blinds did not escalate, then tournaments could take quite a long time. For example, a tournament might start with the blinds at 25 50, and progress to 50 100, 75 150, 100 200, 200 400, and so forth. The fact that blinds escalate during a tournament and there are only a set number of chips in play makes tournament play somewhat different than live game play.

This is a major difference.

None of us got injured as a result of stretching that I am aware of. Also none of us got injured by not stretching.

Emily Bissell, a member of The Outlook's editorial board and an active fund raiser for the Red Cross, took him up on the suggestion as a way to support a tuberculosis sanitarium near Wilmington, Del.

To be fair, a lot of sex workers in the US are human trafficking victims. Europeans like to laugh at Americans and act like we are all prudes (and sure, some Americans are), but the reason we have laws like this is because sex work is super unregulated, and a lot of people who work in that industry are not consenting to working in that industry..

With the Team Bonder resting at home after a minor op to remove a tenner from his wallet, it was a very familiar Wanderers line up that took to the alley.

This question reminds me of a scene from the original Star Trek episode The Corbomite Maneuver where the Enterprise is hopelessly outmatched and the logical Spock makes a chess reference indicating they have lost. Kirk replies to the effect that instead of playing chess they should play poker, and proceeds to make a bluff that succeeds in getting them out of the situation. Of course later we learn it was less the fact that Kirk bluffed, and more that the aliens hadn't really intended to destroy the Enterprise. In Star Trek the Next Generation we see a similar pattern, where second in command Commander Riker is great at poker, usually managing to somehow induce the other player(s) to make the wrong assessment as to whether or not he is bluffing.

I should also point out that my comment about the slutty teacher is more a commentary on how men and women tend to be stimulated by different things. The thing about that archetype that is attractive is the idea of a woman in a position of power that's sexually open. While most men might not want a relationship like that it's really attractive..

Certain factors in MTT play have inherent value on your hole cards. AKos is much more powerful when you are a big stack, as compared to when you are amongst the short stacks and playing on the bubble. This exact situation happened to me last week in the Party Poker Million. I folded the AKos after an early position raise from a big stack, and a re raise from another big stack. I felt my hand was at least counterfeited, and surely, I must have been up against at least a pair Queens. It was really a question of $500 bucks. I was short enough to know I was out of contention for big money, so I decided to go for some money. But knowing the true strength of my AKos in that spot was how I folded.

Well, I have never heard of a KA234 straight. However, Poker is kind of vague. What type of poker are you talking about?Poker is always changing. More games are coming to the table. Heck, if you play short deck trips beats a straight. However, I'm assuming you are talking about holdem.In standard holdem, AKQJ10 is called broadway and A2345 is called a wheel. There is no such thing as wrapping around with KA234.Let me explain things you might be interested in about straights.It's possible for the board to be the nuts. If the board shows AKQJ10 and no flush possibilities, you might as well ship the house, the farm, your bank account, and go into debt. You can't lose. This is a rare situation. Even a straight flush on the board can lose. Example, if the bard is KQJ109 all hearts, you have a king high straight flush. But your opponent could hold the royal. I'd rather have the nut straight that can't lose if my other option was the king high straight flush that can lose.

For an adult or a student who wants to get a decent, cheaply priced instrument, the best thing is to go to an instrument repair place and ask them who they recommend for used instruments. The likelihood is that they've had to fix many of them, and they know where their patrons get the instrument so they can tell you exactly where to go   and more importantly   where not to go. If you've gotten through all those hoops okay, if you play the instrument already and are buying a new one, you should probably play it to see if it feels comfortable to you and if you like the way it sounds.

If there was pressure, then the government already crossed the line and apparently the correct thing for JWR to do would have been to resign and state that her reason for resigning was that she had felt undue pressure.I agree with you that I think it makes more sense to stay and try to do what she thinks is right (if nothing else, because it seems like it hard to know in the moment whether certain statements are pressure or not), but the way that the job is set up, resigning when being pressured by colleagues apparently is the job.stwatchman  4 points  submitted 9 days agoI 100% agree with this.

Player gets dealt a big ace (AK); when the flop appears they hit none of their hoped for cards, then make the dreaded mistake of calling big bets still hoping to hit on the turn, and they miss their needed cards completely on the turn as well, but for some strange reason continue to call bets. They don't realize that only a high card hand is pretty weak without a pair, flush or straight, because any made hand beats a AK high hand. The golden rule is know when you're beat and fold! Of course, a pro is going to play AK, too   but he is going to pop it pretty good pre flop to get heads up, preferably so people suspect he has a pocket pair, then nothing hits, but he still has the bluff, because he made believers by betting hard pre flop, with a good reputation.

Max may get an annual bonus of $13,500 which would be $700 to $800 per month after tax. That provides wiggle room in addition to current unallocated savings of as much as $1,053 per month. That income flow can go to the kids for university expenses other than room and board, for they live at home. In three years, when the kids have finished university, this money can go to retirement savings, Einarson advises. Those savings can be added to their present cash balance, $69,594. For now, if they reserve $34,000 for the remaining university expense, they will have $35,594 for mortgage paydown. The outstanding balance, $262,606 less this residual cash would leave a balance of about $227,000. To pay off that balance in the dozen years to Loretta age 65, assuming three per cent interest, would require monthly payments of $1,880. That $435 more than their present mortgage cost of $1,445 per month, but it would ensure that they go into retirement with no major debt. They could still add $480 to their RRSPs and $500 to TFSAs each month, as they do now, and boost these contributions with leftover cash.

An investigation ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki into Blackwater's September 16 shooting in Baghdad, in which 17 civilians were killed and another 24 were wounded, has determined that the company's operators opened fired indiscriminately and without provocation. government pay $8 million in compensation to each of the victims' families and sever all Iraq based contracts with Blackwater within the next 6 months. government will comply and perhaps even more unclear if it could meet the Iraqi government's demands even if it wanted to. Civilian employees of the State Department rely on Blackwater for protection. diplomatic operations would be paralyzed, at least until another private contractor could be hired for the job. Even if this were to happen, it's doubtful that booting Blackwater would make much difference. More than likely, its operators would quickly find work with competitors like Triple Canopy and DynCorp, who would have to fill the Baghdad security void in Blackwater's absence. The private security sector is a small one after all. Even Andrew Moonen, the Blackwater operator who got drunk in the Green Zone last Christmas Eve and murdered one of the Iraqi vice president's security guards, found a new job with Combat Support Services Associates, which put him back to work in Kuwait just two months after the shooting.

There is also the fact they have their own launcher now and I almost bet anything Starfield and ES6 will be exclusive to the BGS launcher. I do still have some small hope Starfield will be great, and I really want it to be, but I am cautious of it. BGS has to prove themselves again with it. I think most people feel that same way.

The first was a few days ago, I stepped out of my room to go downstairs for a while and do some things and when I came back I noticed that my monitor was off (power still on, but the screen was black). So I thought to myself, oh it just turned the monitor off because its been 20 minutes (thats what I have it set to) and when I tried to make it come back it wouldn't. I also noticed that the keyboard had froze up and NumLock was stuck too, so the computer locked up. However it didn't blue screen or turn off the computer, the screen was just black and unresponsive.

After her father broke up with his long term partner, whom she still considered a parent, my student realized that her gay family was now not part of the gay marriage movement. One of her friends was raised by 4 mothers  the original pairing and then, after they split, the two new parents. How did the gay marriage movement represent their lives? Her dads, who were never married and were no longer even together? Her friend moms? The more she thought about it, she and other "queer spawn" were not terribly well represented by the gay marriage movement. Not only that, but she was unclear whether the people pushing the marriage agenda cared about larger, more important issues like health care or ending the wars.

An ExampleA very simple example could be that the scientist observes that something falls off a desk. The hypothesis   'Things fall when not supported by other things'   springs to mind. From this hypothesis the prediction   'If I drop something else, it will fall'   can be made. And finally the hypothesis can be tested by doing experiments to verify or contradict the prediction, ie, the scientist drops things.

Looking at the farm system there isn much to hope for in 2008, which means were are going to be stuck with more bad Sabean signings. Sure if Barry is gone that frees $18 million dollars but then they sign some has been for $20 million (ex:Benitez, Morris) and then what? The fact that the free agent market forces you to overpay for mediocre talent means that you better have a good farm system.

I tend to clam up at the poker table, terrified to say anything that'll tip others off to the strength or weakness of my hand. According to Sklansky's new book, psychological manipulation is a very important part of No Limit hold em, but as I say, I'm so terrified to say anything that I feel I am missing out on opportunites to send an opponent the wrong way. I'm hoping this forum will become the basis of a 'playbook' to help me open up more at the table.

There is also the whole morbid obsession with death. They teach that the apocalypse is literal and will happen any minute now. We are basically instructed to be ready to die at a moment notice for our faith, as well. We constantly get inundated with stories of people being killed for their faith. They also discourage higher education or any sort of trade that they believe won be useful in the world (the paradise earth that is created after the bloody battle of Armageddon). There are also frequent stories about how people became possessed by demons or were killed by demons that are told from the stage. I remember examples of things like a demon twisting someone head around because they practiced magic, or rock and roll records that screamed when they were burned in an oil drum. There is also things like people who died of preventable illnesses but refused blood transfusions being held up as martyrs.
Both parties had issues with the way the primaries played out in 2016. The republican's 20 candidate field allowed trump to trickle to the top while only maintaining about 1/3 the support of the popular vote.

If the ball was kept each time, in the premier league alone that would be 10 balls X 20 teams X 38 games X 6 seasons = 45,600 balls. Divide by 2 to account for the teams playing each other, result is 22,800 balls in six seasons.

I realize that $100K is a drop in the bucket in the $10billion ocean that is the US porn industry, but still, it does seem like states might be able to capitalize on this. After all, I am not one to believe the economy is about to "right" itself after decades of unsustainable growth, exploitation of the environment, and the transfer of wealth and resources to a few. But state sponsored porn could at least keep things like unemployment benefits around until we come up with a better plan..

The type of coffee you drink can heighten its effect on your breath. For example, an espresso containing a concentrated dose of 75 milligrams of caffeine per ounce will give you hard core coffee breath, not only because of its caffeinated qualities but because its intense flavor will linger.

Maybe you should stop focusing on generalizing all 62 million Trump voters in the same bucket? It easy to pick on the ones who are chanting MAGA while losing their jobs and make fun of them, but this kind of stuff happens with every election. Were all 100% of Obama voters satisfied? I saw many friends disillusioned or even jaded in 2012 when he failed to live up to many promises and their vision of his presidency. Or similarly, there were controversial parts of his administration such as drone killings, ramping up Afghanistan, etc. Do we blame all voters for every mistake?
