For example, Wikipedia notes that the word which means "to swim," spawned, through reduplication, the word which means "to bathe."

The news and the fire department have done this boy and his family a great disservice. How hard is it to say "The dog bit the boy. We will have more details when the investigation is complete."

I find it much more likely the dog went under the fence like the family said. BTW I can find where the family ever said anything different. People are mistaking the fire department changing story when they get caught in a lie with the family changing their story.

UPDATE: The race organizers sent out an email, basically blaming the City of Malden and Dept of Recreation, who they said were supposed to negotiate the permit. They said DCR denied it for "Reasons that are still unclear". So the "solution" they offering is for the half marathon and 5 mile to run the same course, but the 5 mile start an hour and a half later to give the half marathoners time to complete (half due to start at 7AM; there will be slower runners still on the course at that time, including myself).

There is no "right path" for a person with these traits. There is literally nothing you will succeed at with these qualities. Not even menial labor.

Goldstein makes the case for the extreme peripheral usefulness of the Paper in 1939, but in 1944 when the Axis influence in the Middle East was minor adhering to the white Paper was a tragedy: "if the White Paper was unwise and unworthy then, it is more shameful and baseless now"3..

Maybe the best traveled book simply comes down to one that belongs to an aircraft pilot of 40 years experience who has been flying with a single title because that is what they had with them on their very first flight, and has become a good luck token. Perhaps it is a King book, or Robert Pirsig; and maybe it is The Cat in the Hat which was an intended gift for a child, the pilot keeping the original as a charm for a successful first flight, and giving away another copy of the book, and so it has made thousands of flights. Maybe the book is never actually read its just an icon.

For those who are collectors and would like to achieve 100% completion (Collections, Triumphs, whatever), PvP is a much more variable activity vs. PvE. For example, I can spend 8 hours on a raid, fail to complete it, but have a checkpoint to come back the next day and start where I left off. This is somewhat true of PvP ("git gud at countering shotguns", sure), but there are way more variables at play that cannot be controlled by the player (matchmaking, connection quality, queue dodging full stacks, other teammates skill/behavior, etc.).

Sure it sounds ridiculous to say that a spot at one point decides he done with poker because his last few tables weren talkative enough, but there truth to it.Think of it, some regfish is on a losing streak in his poker room, and constantly all of his competition is stoic and refuses to go out of their way to socialize in the slightest even when they the ones being directly engaged. What the fuck is he still playing for? He losing, he not having fun, and the people he losing to seem miserable and make the atmosphere miserable too.Now what if he still had the same losing streak, but every session the atmosphere was lighter? When he tries to talk to someone they talk back, he been able to shoot the shit about sports or TV or crazy gambling stories with some of the other regs, and when he butchers hands for stacks someone would reinforce him just by saying something really innocuous under their breath like "that so sick" as if it was some standard cooler.In which situation do you think the spot is more likely to keep playing?Also keep in mind that OP and I aren asking every reg to try to be the life of the party, but just to go out of their comfort zone a little bit to not be a noticeable detriment to the environment.

Do something to boost that creativity like getting outside your musical comfort zone, going to a show, watching an inspiring film, listening to the music that inspired you the most, spending time with friends, or working on other hobbies. Creativity can be improved, but only in how we learn to access it and store it.

So even if you are all playing the same Nash equilibrium, you could still lose because your opponents are teaming up against you (either intentionally or unintentionally).You also run into the "equilibrium selection problem" where there are multiple Nash equilibria and you might play one while the other players might play a different one.

In two player zero sum games, this doesn come up because any linear combination of Nash equilibria is another Nash equilibrium.

Lets say that you are holding a king of spades and a 5 of spades, now you have limped in to a flop with with 6 guys involved and that reads 5 diamonds Ace of spades and 10 of spades, you already start to calculate your chances, since you have a pair of fives with a king kicker as well as a flush draw you can now count 14 cards that if one lands you have a stronger hand, and with a pair of fives you find yourself behind and pair greater than 6 and since there is both a 10 and an Ace on the table chances are with the 12 other pocket cards on the table that there is one, if there where only two people playing your odds would be less, now lets look at your chances, with those 14 out 2 of them will give you a trip that a 1 in 23.5 chance, 3 of them will give you two pair, that a 1 in 15.6 chance and for the flush you have a 1 in 5.2 chance, simply put one in every 5.2 cards dropped will give you a flush, and since you have 2 cards to come you chances here are good, all in all with the 14 outs you have a 1 in 3.35 chance, even better.

Then two police officers showed up. They said that they were called out due to a report of a disturbance. The ladies seemed to calm down once they got there. The police asked some people what was going on, and then told me that I am allowed to speak whatever language I want, but if I cause a disturbance, I will be arrested for disorderly conduct. They took my ID and I think copied down my information, but they didn do that for anyone else. Then they left.
The cover of Penguin's paperback edition of The Perfect Nanny is archetypal of a certain kind of popular fiction. It depicts the ominous upper torso of a woman of indeterminate age, "elegant in her blouse," as she is described in the book, with its "sky blue Peter Pan collar." The title   invented by the publisher for the American translation   is embossed in a deep navy foil, gleaming when it catches the light. Our imaginations provide the missing expression, sure to be appended in a later printing: Now a Major Motion Picture. Amazing with this cover it isn't yet. In 2016, when Slimani was awarded the Prix Goncourt   the most prestigious literary honour in France, whose past winners include Marguerite Duras, Andr Malraux and Marcel Proust   the book was reissued with a red banner flaunting these laurels, its most brazen display of commercial avarice. In 2012, two children, ages six and two, were stabbed to death with kitchen knives in their family's Upper West Side apartment by their nursemaid. It was a hideous scandal that inspired the sort of headlines that appall and spellbind; the sort that might attract a journalist such as Slimani, observing cooly from across the Atlantic. And yet The Perfect Nanny is not a work of sensationalism. The novel's first sentence disabuses the reader of such false impressions so swiftly and emphatically that it has already become famous: "The baby is dead." No tension. No tingle of shameful thrill. A grim inevitability hangs over all that follows, as we feel that every page, every paragraph, will only lead back to this sobering end, to this atrocity flatly preordained. The baby is dead. There is nothing exciting about it.

At first it was a fairly technocratic arrangement, because the research institutions wanted to ensure the projects they had marked out would not be cancelled or the land repurposed. The political history of Shaja was dominated by the slow persuasion of the institutions by the increasingly complex government that they could be trusted not to do that. These days it a democratic socialist government and economy with a single chamber of representatives; these are proportional to population so the numbers of said representatives are slowly increasing over time.

It needs to, otherwise when adrenaline, for instance, was released, your heart would keep beating at an increased rate forever. The body needs these signals to only act for a while, and to achieve this, it has enzymes to break these hormones and neurotransmitters down. Because of this, dopamine and adrenaline, when injected, only have a half life of a minute or so.There is another, more important, reason why dopamine isn used recreationally (and this goes for using serotonin instead of MDMA too). 
This is nonsense.

Real life applications of Person B is so reliant on critique of individuals that they need something to account for this while leaving them self blameless (this is important because absolutists are narcissists that can never do wrong in their mind).
