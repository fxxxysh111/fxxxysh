Eloquent and surprisingly respect rhetoric from a GOP rep, but missing some key facts. In particular, when it comes to taxing the rich you can just focus on "income". Most middle class and all poor have all of their wealth come from income directly. But the rich get money thru inheritance, capital gains, and hoarded/hidden in overseas banks (and they fight like hell to make sure this is never ever taxed). If THIS money were taxed at the same rate and without the various loopholes that allow tax avoidance, then we see better revenue and better outcomes. That why it isn a lie to say the rich don pay their fair share, but it is a lie of omission to bring up income but leave out capital gains.

Companies already do this to a point, although are hindered by government regulation.

If you have an overall itchiness, that's normal, too; seek out a soothing calamine lotion or moisturizer for relief [source: Bouchez].

Before you start typing, consider the audience and craft a specific writing style to suit who you're targeting.

4. When it's your turn to act, if opponents are slightly reaching toward their chips or even moving their hands almost imperceptibly in that direction, they're trying to discourage your bet. This gives you the opportunity to profitably bet medium strong hands you might otherwise have checked. Sometimes a player may even fake a tell, hoping to induce his opponents to make poor judgments in response to the false poker tell. After all, poker is a game of deception. The general rule is that weakness usually means strength, and strength usually means weakness. But, you must decide how much weight to give a tell at any given moment. If you make learning tells fun, it will be an ever changing, exciting part of your poker arsenal."

I think the deeper cultural issue, is that as marriage disintegrates as a cultural form (most Americans are unmarried), certain segments of the population feel a need to protect it as an ideal. marriage does a lot of work shoring up certain privileges in this society  and I not just talking about the family discount at the local gym. people are considered more mature, more ethical, and more deserving of state rights and privileges. people are also much, much whiter and much, much wealthier than unmarried people.

S. 
He went on to have an illustrious police career but still had more than 100 pellets in his body when he retired..

Encouraging your child to change something about themselves because they're being bullied about it. For example, if your child is chubby and gets teased for their weight, instead of encouraging them to get more exercise or change their diet to lose weight, I think it's much more important as a parent to reassure your child that their weight does not determine their value as a person. You need to be that stable voice that helps them know they are loved no matter what. This can be tough because you don't want to see your child suffering and being bullied, and you might think it would be easier to just help them lose weight. If losing weight is what your child wants to do, support it. Otherwise, you could mess them up long term and inadvertently reinforce the message the bullies are giving and your kid could end up with major body/self esteem issues going into adulthood.
