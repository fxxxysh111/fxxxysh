I have tried talking to parents who let their children put their wet, muddy boots on bus seats, or touch the produce at the grocery store with their visibly dirty hands, or run around the grocery store and almost knock elderly people over. Never once have they reprimanded their child. Instead they told me, at best, to mind my own effing business and at worst, show the child that they can be as antisocial as they want and be verbally disrespectful to others.

Fourth quarter and the first quarter of the year always tend to have elevated provisions because of the holiday spending season, so we tend to see that seasonality in cards and auto, Toronto Dominion Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in a phone interview Thursday. None of them would rise to the level of being of particular concern for us. provisions more than doubled across the bank, surging to $338 million also the highest in at least two years. Most came from Canadian personal and small business banking, the lender largest division, which saw a 41 per cent jump in provisions to $208 million.

Have you ever been so good at a job that your co workers call you in on your day off? Briggs is that good, too, only when he comes in to work, it's to keep someone from jumping to their death off a bridge.

Not even Batman can boast that kind of success rate. Briggs' tireless efforts have earned him the nickname "Guardian of the Golden Gate."

Given the leverage that content ownership affords while hashing out distribution deals in overseas markets and with the streaming services, outright cancellations are going the way of the daytime soap opera. For all that, even CBS is not entirely immune from the creeping paralysis of the legacy and now a word from our sponsors model. Advertising is largely a function of conditioning, and many of the imperatives that made the TV model effective have been eliminated. Or to couch it in our meme drunk vernacular, "Not great, Bob!"

They can live in their bubble and never be challenged by the realities of what they want to do.

WoW started to lose subscribers after Cataclysm release, and lost a LOT of subscribers when Warlords of Draenor came out. Blizzard stopped reporting player counts completely at the end of 2015 because they were dropping so much (their last number released was just over 5 million).

She gets not ten seconds into her well rehearsed "I a lost little ogre, please help me" routine before the ogre patience runs out, it tries to eat her, she dodges, and proceeds to run like hell. The groggy ogre lumbers after her, smashing his way around.

I prefer AA no club as a check back, even though I also check back AA with a club sometimes, though I am more inclined to bet with that hand. My reasoning is that bet should be higher EV than check back if we block nut flush draws and have the backdoor, if neither is the case the EV difference of checking and betting will be much smaller. Basically I waste a pretty good value bet when I check back AcAx, and I get to pot control AA no club on a board where turn and river can easily shift that hand more to the bottom of my range, whereas I am not so worried if I pick up equity when the 3rd club hits. I can definitely see your argument though.

So it not necessarily all around the world (even though that also posible and not unusual) they operate, but maybe they supply a couple businesses in their area, with almost next door service and limit their customers to a number they can handle if expansion doesn make sense.

Couple reasons. Firstly, tradition. Many hotels in America used to be privately owned family businesses. Since those families were   most of the time   Christian, it became a common sight to see Christian symbols in hotels. While that has certainly gone away, the Bible stayed.

After your reply I done some deeper investigation and compared again all my network clients (currently no Windows here but Android and macOS will do it). Android was fast and macOS was also okayish with many files when ONLY using the command line. As soon as I used a normal macOS program with an UI the issues are there again. So I googled for maybe 30 45 minutes and found the main problem on macOS. macOS finder and all programs with UIs who are using same APIs as finder assume that Samba understands macOS specific SMB commands. Of course a standard Samba server does not understand that and so delays happen in the process. So sometimes it even helps to just ask for help and find a solution.

The thing Erik has done along the way that I find the single most important tool in my arsenal is he does hand reviews. He taught me to write down hands as I play.

Es ist ja in Familien, bzw. gerade auch ber mehrere Generation blich, dass man nicht mehr den gleichen Erfahrungshorizont hat: Deine Groeltern/Eltern wissen nichts vom Game of Thrones, du weit nichts von Kaiser Franz. Jetzt knnte man entweder sagen "was beschftigt dich eigentlich gerade zur Zeit?", oder aber man hat eine sinnloses und oberflchliches Gesprch ber "damals"; oder man fixiert sich eben auf die Kinder (dazu kann jeder etwas sagen), oder auf die Krankheiten (auch da kann jeder Mitreden). Was du da mitbekommst, ist meines Erachtens einfach nur Symptom dessen, dass deine Familie sich nichts zu sagen hat; oder vielleicht auch einfach in ihrem alltglichen Leben so wenig Gemeinsamkeiten hat, dass man eben ber Oberflchliches redet. Auch nicht unblich ist, dass man ja, wenn man sich so lange kennt, auch eigentlich noch echt hartnckige Konflikte miteinander hat (Groeltern Eltern), warum das dann fr alle am einfachsten ist, ber Bullshit zu reden. Und tja, Groeltern werden erstens mit dem Alter auch geistig nicht fitter, aber wahrscheinlich wollen sie dir nur zeigen, dass sie sich um dich kmmern wollen, aber sonst nicht wissen, wie.

The emphasis on sports is a function of enhanced reach and the fact that live content is a demonstrably more efficient platform through which to deliver advertising impressions. Eliminating the predations of the DVR from the media calculus automatically gives a live broadcast a significant advantage over pre recorded shows, which bleed ad views in a direct proportion to the frequency with which they are time shifted. In other words, those delayed viewing numbers distributed by the networks are effectively useful only as a means with which to estimate the number of people who skipped, zapped or otherwise sidestepped the commercials.

My brain still craves those little dopamine hits, so when I not giving those to it anymore, I think it gets sulky and pouts so hard it can possibly see how anything else could ever be as fun.

The upshot is it really hard to come up with a reliable winrate for live. It you had a few thousand hours at the one stakes against a consistent player pool, you might be able to confidently nail down a number, but it still peanuts compared to what a typical online player would consider a decent sample size. Plus, your playstyle and strategy is almost certain to adapt and improve over that time, which is going to change your winrate as you go, which just muddies the water even more.

These are not just culturally specific beliefs, but historically specific as well. As Michel Foucault makes clear in his second volume of the The History of Sexuality, before Modernity and the invention of Childhood as a category that was separate from adulthood, children were most certainly part of the sexual economy (as well as the work economy  it is not a coincidence that "age of consent" laws and "child labor protection" laws happened at the end of the 1800s).

Because bureaucrats decided it would be unreasonable to destroy everyone bamboo things for no reason just in case they had some invisible disease on it, they figured they would create a system that travellers could use to get approval and get their stuff labeled as safe to enter the country without relying on the customs people to guess if it okay or not (Import permits). If you don get an import permit, you relying on the CBP guy, who has no specialist training whatsoever because he needs to regulate about a million things, to make the right decision. Sometimes he does and you have no problems for years crossing the border with you bamboo flutes, and then sometimes he guesses incorrectly, and thinks the bamboo looked freshly harvested for whatever reason, and you lose your bamboo flutes.

Of course you would come up with all kinds of crazy theories if you went about investigating like that. That reckless and non scientific.

Here's what I think about when I think about these men doing this job: that two teams, British and German, start to tunnel towards each other's lines, and somehow, in the middle of the battlefield, somehow manage to dig directly towards one another, their tunnels literally colliding. Hand to hand combat through the opening connecting the two sapper tunnels, then gunfire. Alerted, the artillery from each side zero in on what is suspected to be the opening end of the tunnels, pummel them, destroying the access. So now, both sets in what is now virtually one tunnel, are fighting in the dark. Even though the topside is only two feet away, any hole would open into the killing zone, making it impossible to escape that way. It would be a bad place to be.

I do agree with him that massage and movement therapy doesn always address the root core of the pain problem. Some LMT are mostly improving circulation or providing temporary relief of the tension/pain. Yet there are many massage therapists who do treat the root cause. In my opinion, these practitioners are helping clients heal from old emotional wounds. Whether the LMT would explain it that way or not, that is how I see it. It not psychotherapy   but it is touching people in such a way that they feel "touched" or "seen" and they are then able to let go of the physical tension that has been holding in their emotional pain. Sometimes tears of joy, sadness, grief, etc come through and sometimes not. The lack of tears are not a sign that emotional healing has not occurred.

A simple episode of a date gone wrong is leavened with self reflexive gestures and a gymnastic cinematic syntax, leaping from narrative to autobiography and back again, often in the same scene. Nance plunges into his own artistic inscape, asking big questions about how "humans come to experience a singular emotion." His camera moves with the fluidity of the human mind as it traces and dissects memories, digressing from one thing to the next. Nance, who also stars in the film, is plagued by unrequited romance and the asymptotic nature of human relationships. Self absorption, as it turns out, is the stuff of aesthetic exuberance.

He would ask me about boys I was interested in, and told me when he thought I looked nice   often when I wore skirts or low cut tops. One day, he looked at me and said he wished I was older. I remember feeling uncomfortable, but didn't want to say anything. I was conflicted: I wasn't developing feelings, but at that age, I did like the attention. And even though I was uncomfortable with the way he talked to me, I didn't want our relationship to change. I didn't want to make things awkward, because everyone liked him.

It's finally happened! After years of watching and (hopeful) waiting, tomorrow is the day that I finally step into the TEDx arena alongside an amazing array of speakers to give a short talk about 'an idea worth spreading'. students need to provide a clear and succinct account of their thesis and why it matters in just 180 seconds. The aim is to not only make the students think and focus on the core intellectual 'hook' of their research but also to hone their communication skills so they can talk to multiple audiences in multiple ways about their research. This is all jolly good and to be encouraged. TEDx talks, however, represent something of the 'ber three minute thesis test' in the sense that not only must you tackle a big issue but you must also do so in a way that is sophisticated yet accessible, entertaining but serious and thought provoking but not ridiculous. You get eight minutes to do this, not three, but you only get one shot at giving the talk in front of a large live audience and an even larger online audience of many millions. This is reputational poker. Here is the essence of my pitch.

While Trump has been unreliable lately due to his stunt with bump stocks, I think it is safe to say, however, that he would probably veto this legislation as it would not have enough support to garner 2/3rds in both houses to override a veto.

Nguyen has more than enough XsXs in his range for you to be calling here profitably, and while it obviously way better to have A9/AJ here than 99 (since you block Ax combos) and 99 basically doesn have any blockers to his likely FH combos here   unless you throw in A9 suited in there which even if it is in his range would be incredibly unlikely since between you and the board there only ONE combo of A9s   (UTG+1 range), I still think this is a terrible fold.

I don't know why Smith repeatedly did this, because he gave the rounds away each time he did this. Many of the rounds were close until Smith would retreat to the ropes, where he'd get hit by a flurry of head shots from Abraham.

I never said there wasn a constitutional right to a speedy trial. I saying your expectation that speedy equates to 175 days is incorrect. There no hard number set by the constitution. In Barker v. Wingo, the case that effectively established the concept of the modern speedy trial (and the subsequently passed federal speedy trial act) the Defendant waited 5 years for a trial and the Supreme Court held it wasn a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. When a defendant claims a violation, the court applies a balancing test, assessing the length of the delay, the reason for it, whether the defendant asserted the speedy trial right, and whether the wait compromised the defense. It doesn just result in dismissal of the charges.
