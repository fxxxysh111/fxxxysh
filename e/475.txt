What OnThings to doFood and DrinkTheatre and ArtsTV GuideIT is only faint, but there is still a heartbeat on the monitor for Wauchope RSL's Mid North Coast Premier Cricket League campaign. Results over the last two weeks have gone in their favour and a win this Saturday over Taree West will give them the best chance of progressing to the semi finals. Should they lose, they will bow out. Wauchope can finish in 61 points which could be enough if Port City lose both their games (to Macquarie and Wingham)and Taree West can manage only one win from their remaining two games. Taree and Wauchope clash at Andrews Park before the Taree side finish with a match against Pirates next weekend. A Macquarie win over Nulla in the final round would see the Kempsey side also finish on 61 points. Matt Day's men are currently on 52 points and have the bye next week which will provide a guaranteed three points. "If we were playing poker, we've got a chip and a chair. We're still in the game," Day said. "The first focus for us will be getting the win first and then worrying about everything else later." The same squad of 12 will play for a third straight week which had been a contributing factor in Wauchope's late season charge. Weather and washouts could play a determining role in who qualifies for the first finals series of the new competition.

It makes absolute sense. My 81 year old grandmother just surrendered her license this past week as a result of not being able to see, which caused an accident. She admitted fault, and accepted her legal penalties (running a red and causing an accident) and changed out her license for an ID. My grandfather, on the other hand, refuses to give up his license even though he both legally blind and deaf. But, thanks to the great state of Arizona, he legally allowed to drive even though his last license renewal was 25 years ago.

I went to an event last night and one of the things the charity does is give education grants. One grant was given to a dietitian masters student studying the effect high BMI has on the prenatal/postnatal care on women. That in itself is good as being overweight shouldn mean poor healthcare or being treated shitty but in her speech it became apparent that her study is more along the "fatlogic" line that weight loss is way more complicated than CICO and she wants to create a place where there is no discussion of obesity or weight when talking to pregnant women. I guess I just don advocate doctors ignoring one component of health. She was saying things like dietitians need to believe patients when they say what they eat, etc. It was cringey for me as I feel when it comes to eating habits people are generally unreliable narrators and you cannot trust the self reporting. I also expect my doctor to politely and respectfully discuss my weight just as my doctor politely and respectfully told me I was advanced maternal age and what effects that could have on my daughter and my pregnancy. My doctor didn say your fat ass is old to be having a baby or it is a geriatric pregnancy and she didn act like I would be a bad parent having a baby at a later age. She just directly discussed with me and my husband what tests she recommends, etc. (ex. we had a meeting with a geneticist, had the fold screen, etc) for 1st time pregnant women of an older age.
I learned something very interesting related to this when I was younger, but I don know the technical reasons it works. When you wake up at midnight to use the bathroom, before you turn any lights on, close one eye. Keep it closed the entire time the lights are on, then after you turn the lights back off, open the closed eye, and the night vision for that eye will be preserved. I don know why the light in one eye doesn affect the other, I always assumed before I learned this they were connected in the brain. Give this a try if you don believe me!

To why the preference of yoyo to kendama, I personally feel that yoyo is more expressive that kendama. Kendama becomes a lot of rote repetition, and a lot of the higher level tricks are simply, trick you been doing, but with more spins Not that it easy to add those extra spins, it can just become less exciting as time goes on, I think. I know that an oversimplification of it, but I guess I feel like the number of to be performed with yoyo are just so much greater than kendama (at least from what I personally seen). People are breaking new ground with what to do with a yoyo more consistently than with a kendama (again, from what I personally seen). It kinda gives people more room for expression, as they able to combine and explore a lot more different elements and ways to manipulate the toy. On top of that, you able to make the execution of tricks vary wildly depending on personal style and know how which just adds to the expressivity of it all!

Players at that stake (if they are even around) are the most qualified to answer that question, but since you asked it here where the quantity of them may be low, I will offer a guess.

"The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will. United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West's critical facilities in the event of a conflict. They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated. In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants."

Since December I stopped playing after grinding my butt off to level 112 and then I just got super tired and quit. Ever since that time all I do is log back into RDO, hyped to play with my friends and then we all get that familiar feeling of why we all stopped playing after 5 10 minutes in since there is not anything that we have not done over and over and over again in the first 50 60 days since the launch of the Beta.

Funniest shit I saw was on the Red line late one night.

So this other dude comes up to him telling to stop talking like that. The French fry eater completely ignored him and kept doing it. After about 30 seconds it seemed like a fight was on the verge of happening. Right when things couldn't get anymore tense, french fry eater stands up, drops him pants, and pisses on the empty seat next to him. Conflict: Resolved.
One interesting way that the Romans made an attempt to clean the streets is one that seems pretty ingenious, actually. You see, the city had a water supply that was anchored throughout the surrounding countryside. Aqueducts provided arteries of water to supply the city with up to a million cubic metres of water per day  the equivalent of 400 Olympic swimming pools, to use that analogy.

Gestern war wieder Live Poker angesagt. In einem lokalen Klub fand ein 50 Turnier statt. Leider waren nicht ganz so viele Spieler da, weil DK ein Lnderspiel gegen Malta hatte. 25 Spieler sind angetreten, ohne viel zu arbeiten konnte ich meinen Stack aufbauen und konnte mich immer auf AVG halten und pltzlich waren wir nur noch zu 6. Kurz darauf bekomme ich AQ und ein shortie, der die ganze Zeit am shoven war, geht wieder all in. Mit AQ bin ich mit 3x so viel auch all in gegangen, und der spieler zu meiner Linken snap called, DOH. Wie erwartet, lag ich gegen den anderen Spieler hinten 3 way all in: AQ vs AKs vs 44, der Turn bringt eine schne Dame und ich bin jetzt auf Platz 2. Wir sind jetzt noch zu viert und das Turnier zieht sich endlos in die lnge, weil 4 5 ein Spieler von River gerettet wurde. Nach 1 Stunde mit 4 Spielern geht pltzlich schnell, innerhalb von 5 Minuten fliegen 2 Spieler raus. HU bekomme ich in der ersten Hand AJs und pushe. Meine Gegnerin called mich mit 68s. Flop 642, Turn bringt einen Flush Draw fr mich und der River den Flush. Das Turnier ist Beendet und ich kann mir 500 in die Tasche stecken.

Obi Wan defensive Form III lightsaber style is designed to synergize with his carefully planned military maneuvers; as he only strikes when prepared, he can always hold the strategic high ground (That business on Cato Neimodia doesn count). You come to realize that this is why Commander Cody artillery strike failed against Obi Wan, when hundreds of Jedi were killed in similar attacks. Cody failed to grasp the strategic situation, as the Jedi Master elevation was superior to his by hundreds of meters, making him virtually unkillable (You notice that all the Jedi killed in Order 66 were on level ground with the clones, thereby assuring their demise). Had Cody taken his time and engaged the Jedi on even terrain, he would have succeeded. Obi Wan subsequently retreated under the surface of the lake, so that he could maintain the topographical low/high ground.

Especially when dealing with low TDEEs, the smaller eating window can make you feel more satiated. That all IF is though, a smaller eating window, you still have to count calories and track your intake.

What I interested in is what their definition of a bump stock is. The Constitution supposedly protects us from discrimination but it quite specific as to what kind of discrimination. There are many forms of discrimination that the Constitution doesn protect us from. Is it possible for them to swing it by saying that any stock that literally bumps into you when firing is considered a bump stock?? It says "any device with similar characteristics." How similar are we talking here??? It quiet vague and I don like it. Leaves room for loopholes and that BS

Since she said she cool, just doesn want to know, I would respect that like you do and I also would feel weird about it, which might be a passive aggressive way for her to discourage you, but as far as I concerned, you absolutely have her permission.

Honestly, I think a lot of this research is short sighted, and doesn take into account the day to day life of a teacher, in particular. I teach high school English, and I struggle to give meaningful, consistent feedback to all my kids in ways that they absorb and from which they can improve. It a tough argument to make, since from what I can gather, the research is grounded in moving standardized test scores, and "value added" models. In most of the policy makers viewpoints, you actually wrong in your final assessment. It closer to: the best teachers = the best instruction = better student achievement. Put the most kids possible in the classrooms of the best teachers. And honestly, as I type this, I don know if the research suggests that there is a limit to the number of kids in a classroom. Maybe that something to read for as you comb the counterarguments.

In order to evaluate overall treatment effectiveness and costs, researchers use the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) to compare outcomes. A value of 1 would be symptom free or "perfect" health, a 0 would be death, and 0.5 would mean moderate pain which limits some self care abilities. The total costs of a treatment that yields an additional year of ideal health determines the cost per QALY.

He is also the grandson of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir's father, who became president of Pakistan at the end of 1971, then its prime minister until he was ousted in 1977 in a military coup. Bhutto was hanged in 1979 on a spurious charge of murder under the martial law regime of General Ziaul Haq. A friend, the late G Mueenuddin, one of Pakistan's classic civil servants and a bitter Bhutto enemy, told me at that time that General Zia was given the ultimatum to get rid of Bhutto or he would have to go. As for the murder charge, that is often a tactic in Pakistani politics. I once asked Bhutto why so many of his political opponents faced murder charges. He answered, "That is our wild west."

Cats may have begun their domestication due to changes in human lifestyle. As nomads turned from hunting to raising their own crops and animals, cats began to prove their usefulness in ridding rodents from grains and became an accepted part of the family. Cats were even used in transoceanic travels to keep grains on board safe from stowaway rats, including Columbus' fateful voyage, which is how the domestic cat arrived in North America. Although cats did assimilate easily into family living, they never became completely domesticated, which is why, even today, cats are pretty self reliant and still make excellent hunters when allowed to roam free.

The auditioning is a really good first step. Communicating with others is all about making small connections with others and growing that relationship over time. The first time you meet people you can ask about the role they auditioning for, why they choose that role, how long they been in acting basically all context dependent questions. If you get a part and start rehearsing together then you can go deeper with the personal questions. You can just start asking for personal advice the first day you meet someone, or when the friendship is still very casual. Asking people about themselves is an amazing way to make initial relationships, but to develop them it takes multiple meetings and time. Just be sure you read their cues and make sure they comfortable talking. Hone in on the people who ask questions back and keep focusing on those relationships. It a skill you can develop.
