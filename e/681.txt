The reason you have to define a route on the server is because server side rendering requires Next to know which page the route is referring to, so when you open the page /post/some post name, the server has no way of knowing you trying to render the blog page or that some post name should be passed as the slug search parameter.

A better use of my resources would have been to keep a certain percentage of cash always available and deploy it during times of market uncertainty. Easy to say, but, in practice, difficult to do. This is especially true when (as I am) you are trying to broaden your portfolio.

At that point, it will be easier to build up cash and only add to my positions when they dip or during a downturn like the one we experienced from October through December last year.

Want to know why humans are greedy bastards who live outside the means of our environments?

A lot of people are guilty of projecting their feelings into others this game, sadly me included.We just need to remember as a community a few things. The big one is people project their angriest feelings at this game a lot. It's a terribly unhealthy form of venting. It's a way for them to feel like the man when maybe life doesn't let them feel that way.

Zabit fought with no discipline against Stephens though. He tried wall run Showtime kicks, ended the fight with a rolling thunder attempt iirc, pointed up to the sky to celebrate while in the pocket with Stephens, traded with him extensively without any regard for his "don fucking move" KO power, etc. He got tired sure, but he didn completely gas out..

Prosecutors say Tyler Schrier, 23, and Keith James Hudson, 39, took part in a so called "sextortion" scheme targeting poker pro Joe Sebok in the fall of 2010, threatening to post the pictures and intimate emails online if he and other victims did not pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Ok but what if you get a remote speaker and set it to play some preset audio files at random times. Hide it in your city at very difficult to find places and if the cops don find it, move it every few days to different locations and hide it again. The audio files should contain like Gunshots, domestic violence sounds, loud crass gangsta talk, random fighting sounds, sounds of people begging for mercy, racist KKK rally talk, and sounds of people smoking dope. Pretty soon your city will be quite empty and home prices down, you buy your house, and stop the speaker noises. People move back, housing prices spike again, and you make a fortune!

Take advantage of your position on the table. When you are the last player on a table, you have the fortunate advantage of observing your competitor and how they act. If the player calls, raises or folds, you can watch them. You can make a psychological profile of your competitors in this position. This will help you win!
I was a cobol programmer in the late 90s working for a software company that developed financial software for local government. It comes to no surprise to me that these applications would still be in use (after our Y2K fixes :)) as they just worked. After the initial development/testing/go live we'd have a few months of random bugs but after that it was just people entering bad data.

Having said that, to get to REALLY high stakes PS play money poker you would have to either play for a LONG time on there accruing chips to play that high, or purchase millions (or billions) of play chips from PS. Therefore, i studied poker a ton before I put money onto any website. In retrospect I wish I had put some money onto sites years ago rather than waiting. I would suggest you just deposit a small amount of money that you would usually use for entertainment and play the smallest stakes. If you lose it then you can study, learn from your mistakes and get better, then deposit a little more. Rinse and repeat until you are a winner.

The importance of good footwear. Those pointy little shoes you just bought for a hundred dollars, over time, can cause a bunion to form due to the constant pressure they exert on your toes. They are shaped in a way that will cause your toes to be pushed all together. Pointed toe shoes like these are the most obvious example of outside forces causing a bunion to form. It's also one of the reasons why women suffer from bunion pain more often than men do. But any shoe that restrains the natural width of your foot around the toes area can ultimately lead to a bunion.

Interessant finde ich, dass hier auf La Palma die Idee zur Bildung eines Allparteien Stadtrates als Schritt zu mehr Demokratisierung bewertet wird bei uns in sterreich ist man gerade dabei auf Lnder  und Gemeindeebene genau diese Regelung abzuschaffen, was dort ebenfalls als Schritt zu mehr Demokratie und als lngst berfllige Abschaffung des gefeiert wird jedenfalls regiert die PP Los Llanos als Minderheitsregierung und bei der ersten auerordentlichen Gemeinderatssitzung am Dienstag 23.6. gab es noch keine Einigung hinsichtlich der Politikergehlter berichtet die digitale Lokalpresse. Es bleibt also spannend und die Lokalpolitik in Los Llanos knnte in den nchsten vier Jahren von wechselnden Mehrheiten geprgt sein.

That's exactly what I did, but it was a slight bummer as the WS played out and it was going to be 3 2 TEX, so we'd have no shot of seeing a STL clincher and possibly would have to watch TEX clinch. Then game 6 gets rained out. We knew how this was all going to play out and we're pretty excited that now we'd either see a game 7 or get all our money back.

Ok I read a bunch of comments in this post, and here my 0.02 cents worth. The answer to whether this is a good UX decision depends on the TESTING. If Sephora users (or whoever this is) found this solution worked well for them  then congrats  it good UX. Customer satisfaction is the measurement of success in this case, and none of us know the data on how well this satisfied their customers. I can see good arguments why this would be a good or bad solution depending on various factors, but if their customer is the type that a) reads and b) prefers this kind of option, then I would assume they would have high customer satisfaction.

Bodies of water seem to have held some spiritual significance, probably being seen as liminal spaces between the physical world and supernatural otherworld. We can assume this based on votive offerings left in lakes, ponds and rivers across Celtic speaking temperate Europe, where expensive objects like swords, jewelry, even purpose made silver model boats were just dumped into the water. This indicates that bodies of water were likely seen as places where the lines between natural and supernatural were blurred, where the gods and men (deuogdonoi in Gaulish) could come into contact, with the intent of currying favours with divine powers by leaving them a sacrifice.

Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between sitting time and all cause mortality, with adjustment for potential sociodemographic, behavioural and health confounders..

After I won I got 3 golden raspberries, 6 rare candy, and maybe something else I don remember. Happened very fast. I got a chance to catch the Gengar with a white poke ball. It had 1400ish CP, not like the really high CP one I just fought. I fed it a golden raspberry and caught it with a curve ball and "great" throw on the first try. It was not bouncing around or anything.

Ugh. I hate that they doing that. Block those fools. And I seriously doubt anyone hair is now growing back from that shit. None of my FB friends, or IG friends, sell that crap. They all seem to gravitate towards makeup and oils. But it all the same at the end of the day. I have a friend that actually feeds oils to her kids. I cringe every time I see her post food and say that instead of actual lemon juice, she used the oils. Uh. Those poor kids. But you fighting the good fight. It sucks. I hate suggesting to block them, because they take that as a victory. But they aren worth any stress or strife.
The price is a set 2,250 per girl/woman, all inclusive. As Eden operates a policy of taking a minimum of two, this bumps the price per session up to 4,500 baht. The price per hooker is not too bad (although above average, for below average looks see later), but the point is the policy means you will be spending a minimum of 4,500 baht to get laid. 
Nearly every single thing in this game is dependent, at least in some way, upon a random number generator. When things spawn, what spawns, which species will spawn in a given nest, etc. For the most part, this is fine. But there is very little that you get based on your skill. Sure, CP bonus for good, great, excellent throws. But most of the game is based on randomness. Are you getting Sinnoh stones because you are a skilled trainer Am I not a skilled trainer because I have not received a Sinnoh stone in like two weeks despite training and battling regularly? What is the number of times you have had a raid Pokemon flee on you despite having landed 10/12 excellent throws? Because the actual decision of if you caught the Pokemon is based on randomness tweaked by certain factors like your throw being curve, excellent, the weather, etc.

Wollongong's Dean Lee beat out Berkeley player Brad Micalef (2nd) and Bulli's Rosa Spencer (3rd) to win the tournament, which began at 10am with 93 competitors and only concluded some 13.5 hours later just before midnight.

Thehigher stakes game carried a $220 buy in, with competitors playing undera knock out format. The eight tables, each with 13 players, was dwindled down throughout the day until only Lee, Micaleff and Spencer were left sitting at the table. The trio, all friends from the Illawarra circuit, agreed to split the prize pool for the top three placings evenly between them. They did, however, playa finalopen hand to determine the winner, with Lee claiming victory.

Modern Macau was set up on December 20, 1999 when China incorporated it as a special administrative region.

Poker games can reflect your moods. If you are in a depressed state or a bad mood, you may feel your game will be not so good as well. So do not let your emotions get the best of you. Just walk away when you are playing poker with a heavy heart. Your game will be obvious and your emotions transparent to your opponents. Always play poker when you have a clear mind and a focused game.

I advise not having any plans for the day/night you first try eating. In the beginning, I made the mistake of thinking I was as high as I was going to get, then going to a local night market.

I typically do not trust journalists or lawyers but I get your point. I do not believe that this is relevant in the disney/gunn case as any the exec in the original piece was speaking to an involved third party. There was no negotiations or conversations with Gunn.

Look, you think I am a troll because I do not swallow what you are saying. I am sorry the world does not always bow down to you.

I keep getting hit on by guys who are married. Every single one of them just wants me for a side piece, something to be used and thrown away. Obviously, I don't go along with it. The thing I can't stop thinking about is how good it feels to be wanted so much. Even if it's vile and frankly disrespectful to me, I've been so lonely that the intense attention they pay to me is overwhelmingly enjoyable. It feels really wrong to enjoy it so much, but good god I really do. I just wish that someone decent would show half as much interest.

They're cops, not combat troops. We should never force our LEOs to go into combat. They shouldn't be in that position. Half a century ago cops didn't go into schools and face an AR15. Neither our children nor our police should have to face firearms like that. It's not just schools either. We have open carry assassinations going on and people fight for the right to carry a rifle on their shoulder but not for the rights of a veteran to ride his bike on his own city street. Point is, cops shouldn't be facing mass shootings while working in schools. They should be making sure kids aren't smoking, cutting class or throwing paper airplanes.

My understanding is that another problem with hadiths are that Muslims have no agreed upon leader. (like the way theres a pope in catholicism) So if a Random Imam starts referencing an old and obscure hadith and teaches outdated lessons on it, there no pope figure to say "Listen this guy is wrong, this is how god wants us to interprete this line." Which allows for virtually any interpretation of the material. But im ignorant and likely missing some things.

I actually think it a good thing. Pokerstars has been the top site for many years now in regards to traffic, software and their rake back has never been top notch but I think this could be the nail in the coffin. Most of the serious cash grinders have already moved to partypoker due to the shitty rng rake back program but now with them increasing the rake on the low buy in tournies I hope all of these tourny grinders move to another site as well..

Oh man, so this happened back in middle school for me. I want to say 7th grade (American public school system)? Anyways this was at the end of the day and I was running late to my last class and for one reason or another I had a pencil in hand and making a mad dash to try to beat the bell. I was about to make to the class room, but then I trip and fall in front of the door and the pencil goes straight into my hand and I might have cursed in front of the teacher. Minor details, but the pain was real. Ended up finishing the day stopping by my science teacher room since since I knew he have tweezers to remove the graphite and it was on the way to the nurse office anyways. If you like black coffee and espresso, it tastes delicious. Almost like coffee caramel ice cream, but not overly sweet at all and enough of the espresso cuts through to give it some character.

Our 16oz is $4.59 after tax and comes with two doubles, plus whatever syrups you want/whip cream.

Understanding that Jesus suffered immensely and died for ALL of us, so that we could have the promise of eternal life if we simply believe, is a basic tenet of faith that most Christians know and defend well, . It's what brought those believers in Texas into their church on that fateful Sunday morning, it's what brought those who died there to everlasting life in heaven and it's what will bring those who survived peace and strength beyond all human understanding or ability as God carries them through the pain and suffering brought on by the unthinkable sin of another human being..

Sure they may look the same or even taste the same, and the labels are likely to contain similar (if not identical) lists of key ingredients. Does this mean that they are all the same? Certainly not! In fact, numerous manufacturers state that their products meet or exceed all GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards, but do they really? It appears that the only objective way to determine the credibility of a manufacturer's GMP status is to see its certification. Why go through all that trouble? Because end products from questionable, non GMP certified manufacturing processes may lead to less safe and less effective supplements for your patients.

Ear candling, a traditional therapy used by the Ancient Greeks, was popularised by the Hopi Indian Tribe of the American South West. The modern incarnation of the treatment is primarily based on the form used by the Hopi (meaning "Peaceful People") Indians who possess great medicinal knowledge and spirituality. The Hopi Nation are renowned for their extensive healing skills.
So much of how we think is rooted in our language, in our idea of form and syntax, that thinking outside of these almost leaves us with no tools to share our observations. We don have words for these concepts, should they even be called that.

The first step to create a clear call to action is to determine your goal. Sure, it is nice to try to get as many visitors as possible to the website that displays all those Real Clay Poker Chips that you have to offer.

The boys' search for their missing father was presented by the Supernatural advertising campaigns as the main plot of the show, a parallel, presumably, to Mulder's search for his sister in the X Files.

Should I cut off this friend? I have this friend of mine that can be really selfish at times. It normally happens when hes drunk. He can drink on weekends and he drinks all weekend long. He just got a DUI a few weekends ago and he told me its his 2nd but I know hes still going to court for his 2nd DUI. So I think he lied to me there. His step dad died a couple weeks ago and he never even told me about it. He never told me when the funeral was. He came over the next day and asked me for gas money. I still helped him out because it was $10. Hes not the type of friend that would go out of his way for someone either. I remember I bought beer for us when we went to this party one weekend. Then the next day he didn't even give me a ride home. He excuss was hes too hung over so I took the bus. Also if he doesn't get what he wants from someone he can get mad at them. Hes done it to me and other people. I've been thinking about ignoring him from now on.
