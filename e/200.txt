Now that you've done your homework and come armed with the facts, it's important to follow the advice of Han Solo and "Don't get cocky." Low balling can be a slippery slope which can leave you emotionally flustered in no time. And before you know it, all of your power goes straight out the window. Stick with the numbers you researched and don't try to do the limbo in the negotiations and see how low you can go.

The second difference is that the melody in the second bar is the dissonant major 7th, which doesn't resolve. Instead it's repeated over the barline to become the dissonant sharp four, which then resolves to the third. Harmonically, it's got a classical pedigree, but with a contemporary twist.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsTV GuideDigital Print EditionRUGBY league great Nathan Hindmarsh played 330 first grade matches but it was a much bigger figure   $300,000   which made his off field story compelling listening yesterday. The former Parramatta captain lost more than that through gambling over eight years. It was curiosity that first encouraged Hindmarsh to put coins into a poker machine when he was 18 and at the start of his rugby league career. And when he saw those coins multiply when they fell into the tray, he was hooked. "If I hadn't won the first time would I have had an issue with it? I don't know," he said. "But I did win the first time and lost and lost after that." At 26, Hindmarsh defeated his addiction before it dragged him to rock bottom. "I didn't lose houses, cars, friendships or relationships," he said. "You can get help before it gets to that point." Hindmarsh, who spoke to 150 people at Albury TAFE as an ambassador for Clubs NSW for Responsible Gambling Awareness Week, encouraged people to speak up if they were concerned about their gambling habits. "If you have a problem you will have that gut feeling," he said. "Once people understood I had a situation and wasn't just pissing money up the wall, it became easier. "If you have that feeling of disappointment, resentfulness and disgust then you have an issue." Hindmarsh is not trying to stop people gambling   he just wants them to learn to do it responsibly. "It's about education," he said. "You always talk about drugs and alcohol and I want to add gambling to that list.

But this is a solid point, and we consider it next time we do this. We committed right now to putting the rules to vote yearly, so there will be another opportunity (and more in the future).Another thing is that the questions should have straight yes or no options without this ranking thing. It was confusing to figure out.The reason we use the ranked choice system for some questions is that we want to make sure people have the chance to pick from a variety of options, rather than having to pick between just two when the situation (and people preferences) are more complex.

Does a private rescue have the legal right to have a ten page application and a $600 adoption fee and brag that they reject 75% of applicants (as did a rescue I worked with once)? Sure. But if they claim that their goal is to "save lives", then that makes them hypocrites. Most people make fine dog owners without all the gatekeeping. Mean, they hold a dog in foster for months while they take forever to vet a potential home.

This is the creepy part and the part that explains why there can be so many monstrous males in our midst, the kind that beat the shit out of a woman for refusing to dance, then walk into the bodega next door and blithely steal a beer. Is a very thin line between what is fetishized about masculinity within the trope of romance  the ability to overpower and dominate and even be violent  and what makes for actual monsters who go around raping and killing girls and women..

Usually, after the first set of cards is dealt players choose which ones to keep and then they can decide to play those cards in multiple hands. For example, if players choose to play the cards in three different hands, the same kept cards will form three different hands and each hand will get a draw from a different deck.
Yes, it takes a lot of your free time, but you get fairly compensated for it with overtime pay, so money stresses are out the window, and if you someone like me who was spending way too much time watching TV and sitting on reddit while working from home anyway, the lifestyle can be a welcome change.

Depends. Will the game only be played in real time or will you allow games that last days or weeks where players take their turn when they want? If the latter, then you want to take the no database/in memory database advice with a grain of salt. Depending on scalability concerns, if you care about long running games but don need massive efficiency, a disk backed database will be easier, and still perform well enough. Everything in programming is about tradeoffs, there no one right answer, but when your first getting it working, whatever is easiest for you is probably the best place to start, especially if you not a super experienced developer.

I think this is a good theory but I doubt this would be what happens, and I doubt this could in any possible way turn out well for the Waterford's. Given the intense fighting from the ep11 promo, I think we will see the fred/SJ fighting seen from the season 2 trailer ("we can't explain this one away. They'll say we're part of the resistance" "if you'd shown that girl an ounce of kindness she'd never have left") which implies that this was definitely not planned and they both know they're in terrible danger..

Essentially, I wanted to know what I could do differently / more efficiently, suggested changes, really just anything that could be helpful.

It's good for your debugging, but not so good for adding future functionality for actually calculating poker hands, and developing strategy. So, while my draw_next_card above returns a readable representation, you're better off creating a class Card, which has an __str__ method that has the same implementation as readable_class_name.

Molly Bloom's story has it all: Russian mobsters, FBI bust ins, push up bras and cash. Millions and millions of it. The heroine of Molly's Game was on track to be an Olympic skiing champion, until a freak accident took her out of the race, and a very different career ensued, as she inched her way, stack heeled, into running the most infamous high stakes poker game in Hollywood..

This is admittedly an extremely simplistic strategy, but it is actually not too far from correct early game play in sit and go tournaments at any stakes.

In fact it will give you a substantial edge against most of your opponents who play loosely and badly. 
In practice, you should be fine. Just keep an eye out and try to recognize items you have difficulty with.

O, I totally agree. Honestly, they have great intentions. I was on a retreat and someone asked "How do I know this isn a cult?" I was taken back. The teacher of the retreat simply said that if you feeling happier as a result of the practice then what more can you ask for? She also said that the tradition doesn make anyone do anything. Which is also true. So saying it a cult is a misguided statement in my opinion. I said what I said above because I particularly interested in Awakening and dharma for all. There a price barrier and none of the practitioners I met or known want to claim awakening or seek awakening in this lifetime. In your view what have you gained and learned from the practice?

And you can say that Israeli hardline policies and construction of checkpoints etc were a result of Palestinian terrorist attacks. And you can say that the Palestinian terrorist attacks were a result of marginalization etc etc etc etc. It devolves into nothing more than a chicken or the egg equation.

This isn't to say that those are literally the best charities, of course. But those seem to be the most likely to be the best charities in expectation, given the information that GiveWell  one of the best charity evaluators in the world   is aware of.

Assuming the Lakers miss the playoffs, Lakers still get a solid 1st round pick, Lebron can rest up in the off season early after having spent an absurd amount of time over the 2010s playing in the playoffs, and the Lakers can sign big name free agents in the summer.Honestly, everyone has known this to be a transition year for the Lakers as they signed short term contracts to pad the roster for this year and have ample cap space during the free agency period.

Your body doesn just switch over to fat only when it completely done with all the glycogen. Being fat adapted means it just more likely to use up fat instead of relying completely on your glycogen stores   up to the point where there are no glycogen stores left. And you get more ready to burn more fat instead of just glycogen the longer you stick to a low to no carb diet..

My younger sister would typically fall asleep every night on the couch in front of the TV and make her way up to bed in the middle of the night. At one point in my webcam view, I saw my sister leave the living room and go up the stairs. The thing that struck me as odd was that I didn hear anything.

It is alleged the woman slapped her daughter hard on the face, leaving a red mark that could still be seen by police three hours later.

"The big operators have been attempting to grow their gaming revenue in recent years by moving more machines to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities."

Sports became central to the American higher educational system over a century ago as the real bourgeoisie consolidated power.

At 1:14 you then repeat your past mistake and fear the hunter again, and the druid repeats the exact same thing he did before. And it happens again.

Betty Lou Manizer is great but way too dark on my winter skintone, so I hoping to pan it this summer, and until then I using it as an eyeshadow or very, very lightly over my contour.

Liv: The summer I graduated, I didn't have any job prospects lined up, nor had I applied to any graduate programs. I was spending most of time playing guitar and going to rock clubs, and came across an advert for a game show advertised as "could you use your powers of skill and deception to win 100,000?". As a debt strapped graduate, this seemed like a fun opportunity to make some quick, life changing cash, so I applied. 
Or at least the sort of students any college should want to attract  the ones who know that it not about "perfect" but about knowledge  which can happen in crumbling buildings with no air conditioning and weeds all around. And knowledge which can happen without the help of vice presidents without end earning 5 times what the professors teaching them earn. In fact, I be willing to say that few students care about the administrators they encounter in their four years at college and if the cost of the administrators was offered to them as a choice, a sort of educational menu, most students would choose lower costs over "perfect."
That's $78.5bn below President Obama's original budget proposal, which would've added $40 billion to 2010's funding levels, and $6.5bn below John Boehner's original counteroffer, which would've subtracted $32bn from 2010's budget totals.

If this is your first stats book, I recommend thinking of things like this until you eventually get a formal explanation for random variables. The trick is to realize when you thinking about functions on the random variable, and functions on the data. Also note books are notoriously bad about mixing up capitals and lower cases for the sake of brevity, but it should be clear if you talking about aspects of your random variable, or functions on your data.

Going along with your analogy, it like if your friend says he thinks his wife is an alcoholic and instead of supporting him you say "I only seen her drink one beer a month  I really don think she an alcoholic." See the difference? We are supporting (or ignoring) the person who is here.. 
When you are in position, you want to make your opponents decision as hard as possible. By raising your marginal hands on the flop, you making it easy for the out of position player to play. They can just call or just shove with all their good hands and the strong draws and you fold out all the hands you are beating.

If this is 1/2 live and theres 3 limps and I in the BB I going to 18 20. Postflop I dont think this is a situation where you dont Cbet ever. I would only bet really high equity hands. Basically I would bet top pair second kicker or better and 8 out draws or better as bluffs. Hands like gut shots that I would bluff with a lot heads up would no longer make the cut multiway(unless maybe it was a gutshot and two overcards like KQ on T92r).

1) Draw a horizontal line and mark off increments of 1 to 7. This will represent the numbers 1 through 7 that will appear in the original list. In other number sets, it may be beneficial to find the range of numbers that are presented. 2) Draw a vertical line, and mark off increments of 1 to 10. This will represent the number of times (frequency) that each number appears in the list. 3) Going through each of the numbers in the list, begin marking Xs, or some other tally, to show how many times each number appears. In the example given in the question, the answer to this would be: (Number = Frequency) 2 = 1 3 = 3 4 = 3 5 = 1 6 = 4 7 = 1 (Full Answer)

I just don't like how shyness, sensitivity, and general nervousness are all reasons for why men are single. Like none of these things are actually harmful or toxic. Just because I'm quiet around strangers or a bit insecure about my appearance it doesn't mean I deserve to be single. Yet people on Reddit tell men that they need to be above average in many aspects before finding a mate. The bar never stops going up. I believe that men should be given more elbow room when it comes to confidence and such. Not everyone is a 6'2 athlete with charisma and a 6 figure job.

Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently. Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio.

For example, the agency's rules about poker games are 5 years old and don't reflect a 2010 change in state laws that did away with a $100 limit on poker games. DBPR held a workshop on the card room rules in February, the first since a July 2010 workshop that went nowhere. 
La plupart des Apiaces (livche, persil, cleri, anglique, coriandre, carvi, cumin, impratoire, laser, etc.) contiennent des substances connues sous le nom de furocoumarines (furanocoumarine n lui, que le terme anglo saxon comme me l fait remarquer une lectrice du blog en mars dernier). La berce n chappe pas. C pourquoi il importe d vigilant lorsqu a affaire  elle, mais pas plus qu ce qui concerne l par exemple. Et je dis bien vigilant, pas paranoaque. A l frais, la berce commune peut parfois provoquer des irritations, des vsicules douloureuses, des dermites de contact (dermatite des prs par exemple) chez les personnes sensibles. Tous les mots passs en gras sont d ils permettent une nuance et vitent autant que faire se peut de croiser la route de propos extrmistes, donnant l que cela se passe toujours ainsi chez tous le monde. Cette nuance monumentale fait paradoxalement d plante commune figure de paria: Dans la pratique, explique Thierry Thvenin, depuis quinze ans que je cueille de la berce, avec des dizaines de personnes diffrentes, et que j rencontre bien davantage (cueilleurs amateurs ou professionnels), je n pu encore entendre de tmoignage vcu de brlures dues  la berce sphondyle (5), ce qui s grandement de ceux qui prtendent que la berce, anime d criminelles, serait prte  sauter sur le rble du premier promeneur venu!

Now you have the full sequence, but you still need to set the framerate and the resolution of the output video. To set the framerate, just go to Video > Frame Rate, and where it says "change frame rate to (fps)", put your desired framerate in there and click OK. Personally I think about 8fps is good so you can actually keep track of what going on.

I have no intention of weighing in on the video itself or what soldiers were or were not doing in it. But I must weigh in on the utter and complete lack of journalistic integrity at the Times. 
I have this one, which I suspect is somewhat similar. I like it a lot; it nice and has (for English books) very good paper (for some reason, English books use paper that a lot rougher than books in my home country do).

General Sahib and his pets have launched Operation Kursi Bachao with an urgency which would put the desperate veterans of Dunkirk to shame. The 'strategy' is to launch a three pronged thrust to retain power, and talk to just about everybody to see who'll cut the best deal. The Benazir Bhutto/General Musharraf duo which is being touted in Western capitals as the best thing since Batman and Robin is designed to fail from the beginning because Benazir is no Robin and General Musharraf is not Batman. Both have huge and fragile egos which will not permit any deal to actually work so the search for heroes to save Gotham is still on. And so the cookie crumbles.

I wonder if the cured were the small percent of suffers with true bacterial prostatitis. Or does massaging actually help release the tense pelvic floor muscles when done, offering some relief? My doc tried the protocol with little results. And has stopped doing it for his patients. 
If you have any similar issues, as you can imagine, massages will release an awful amount of stress and tension. Muscles are relaxing back to how they should be, and the body needs time to reach homeostasis again.. 
Moon made it to the heads up finale with a string of improbable TKOs, including one of highly touted pro Phil Ivey, who went out in seventh place, and then Begleiter. Those two knockouts came in rapid succession, and both times Moon held ace queen, was behind at the start and then got just the card he needed. In Ivey's case, Moon faced an ace king but won when he paired his queen. 
As I got older I was introduced to more drag culture through movies and television (one of the ways I knew my husband was "the one" was when I popped our VHS copy of Priscilla while we were still in high school and he wasn like "oh this is weird.") I have a two year old now and we take her to the children festitivites during pride (they do drag queen story time, "love bubbles" where they have someone come in and blow huge bubbles, that sort of thing) but I don watch Drag Race or queens youtube channels around her because it not really appropriate content for children. I think there also something to be said for people who take their children to drag events but don really do much to support LBGTQIA individuals. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth because they taking from a community for their personal entertainment/gain but not actually doing much to support that community itself buuut that a different soapbox entirely..

My emotions tell me that to stand up for myself or someone else is bad. Because conflict leads to violence. It not true and it not logical but that where my mind goes. This is a direct result of the violence of my childhood. Example. Cable guy was at my house. He started being rude to my wife. I had a choice. Allow it to continue, or confront. So what I meant what that the perception of the potential for conflict is in my mind, and my mind alone. What if it escalates? What if he actually gets more belligerent, or even violent. So what did I do? I allowed him to continue to berate my wife because I was afraid to say, "You know what, let not do this today. I call you back out of I change my mind. Now, goodbye." I felt horrible and realized my actions did not match up with what I claimed to have importance in my life. That encounter was a catalyst that spurred me on in this journey.

I lived 6 hours from the nearest Asian grocery store (let alone enclave) as well as in the heart of enclaves. The years I spent in remote areas especially as a child were not fun at all, but it made me that much more grateful to live in an enclave now.

I got some removal pads recently to try to find out again if they were still annoying, and fared a lot better. The smell was almost pleasant, and the pads were better as they were smaller, so although they probably were as saturated with remover as the last time I tried there wasn't so much to go on me, and one pad was enough for all my nails. Untouched, most polishes last until they've gradually worn off with the nail which for some polishes can take weeks. One fun thing to do is to paint your toenails and watch them grow over a week as the lower edge of the polish moves forward with the advancing growth of the nail. Never scrape the polish off as this is bad for nails, and makes them prone to flaking.
