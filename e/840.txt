To anyone else who is following this thread, and has been a victim of this guy or anyone else, regardless of what sex the perpetrator is or whether you reported it, please know that support is available. First off, free counseling is provided by Franklin County through CTAP (the Crime and Trauma Assistance Program) run through Mt. Carmel, and I can vouch that it was helpful to do it. Although I sure this fluctuates, I recommend getting on the waiting list now, even if you uncertain as to whether you follow through or not, because it took six or seven months to get in. All their therapists are trained specifically in helping people recover from crime based trauma, so they see a lot of sexual assault victims. Secondly, if you do report, you allowed to access an advocate through the courts that can help you navigate the system, and can give you some idea of what to expect.

As play continues, players will bust out and choose to leave. When you are playing multiple tables, it is unfair to have a large disparity in the number of players at each table. During play, the tournament director should re seat players at different tables to keep a reasonable balance. If at a three table tourney where 10 players start on each, a particular table experiences a rash of bust outs and is left with 7 players while the other two lose only one between them. Players at the table of 7 are playing 30% more hands in the blinds, which causes irritation to the players. Refer to Reseat Players in Poker Tournements.
For mosquito or other insect bites that don't demand much attention, a simple dab of essential oil of lavender or tea tree provides relief from itching. Chamomile and lavender essential oils reduce swelling and inflammation, and diminish itching or other allergic response. Bentonite clay (available at your natural food store) poultices are of great help for more painful stings or bites. As the clay dries, it pulls toxins to the skin's surface to keep them from spreading, and it pulls out pus or stingers imbedded in the skin. Adding essential oil to clay keeps the clay reconstituted, preserved, and ready for an emergency. If an allergic reaction, such as excessive itching, swelling and inflammation, or difficulty breathing, occurs following a bite, call a doctor immediately. On this page, you will find all of our herb profiles and instructions for treating medical problems with herbal remedies.

I don live there anymore, but I did as a child. All the backyards with kids had fences to separate the kids from the canals. I remember once after a big rain, there was an enormous alligator in a storm drain   probably an 8 footer. It was the kind of drain with a big flat square metal grate on top and the gator was probably three feet down from sidewalk level.

I'll never be a housewifey type of person, I'll never have enough tact to not occasionally interrupt, and I'll never be able to keep organized or avoid racking up tardiness at work because I lost my keys again. Most of the men I've dated, including my current boyfriend of 3(!) years, have a lot of trouble coming to terms with this and it does cause issues. He doesn't think I'll be able to raise kids with him someday because "I can't even keep my medication bottle out of reach from the dogs, how am I going to be able to keep a kid safe?".

Buttermilk is a popular ingredient in desserts for meals that call for a lush finale, and that same quality makes it a perfect post coital reward, too. How? Try a buttermilk shower. The wonderful feeling of cool buttermilk poured over the body can be enough to start an encore. For the non kitchen savvy, heed this important tip: Do not, under any circumstances, microwave or heat the buttermilk much above room temperature; doing so will make it curdle. Speaking from experience, stinky clumps of curdled buttermilk is not the best way to put an end to the evening.

If the journalists at the BBC had stopped for a moment and asked "If I were queer, would I ask this question? How would it feel to be queer and know that if I lived in Uganda I could be killed for loving someone else?" then they know that killing people for the gender of the people they love is no different than killing people for the color of their skin or their religion.

We have entirely shared accounts with the exception of our individual retirement accounts and a single credit card each (though all are aggregated into Mint which we can both see). It's what works for us, and I totally understand why separate accounts might work better for others, but I don't understand secret accounts except in cases of abuse.

Mike Herea, Promotions Department Manager for Pacific Poker has witnessed the affects of two of the world's biggest poker names coming together. "The World Series of Poker is unequalled by any other poker event in the world today and is a great stepping stone for any online poker who wishes to make a mark in the off line poker world. That is why everyone wants to play at the World Series. In which other field could amateurs be rubbing shoulders with professionals?" Herea said.
Money bet at thoroughbred tracks dropped from just over $15 billion in 2003 to less than $11 billion in 2013, according to the Jockey Club, an industry clearinghouse.Though stronger financially than dog racing, horse racing is also far more expensive to stage, and only a handful of the biggest tracks are profitable without casinos to support them.Some within the horse racing industry see decoupling laws as a threat to their own sport."They could set a dangerous precedent for all breeds of racing," said Lonny Powell, the CEO of the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association, who worked for years as a regulator of dog races.Melbourne Greyhound Park, a smaller track in central Florida, sees the biggest crowd each year during the Kentucky Derby, when around 3,000 patrons turn up to watch the simulcast screens and place bets on the horses.Cashing in on those rare events is not enough for track operators.

At the end of the day he won 4 matches in ranked TV majors all year (where one of those was vs some jobber in the UK open and another was in a race to 5 vs the lowest ranked BDO player in the Grand Slam) and hasnt bothered his arse playing any euro tour or floor events.

This means that the first card dealt can be any value. For example, the first card dealt is a 10, and now the second card has to be a 10. After the first 10 is dealt, there are 51 cards left in the deck, and 3 different 10's.

My advice as a slightly older person than you is to resist the urge to spend up to your "budget" of $2400. That a lot to pay in rent, even when you make 95k. At that level of income you should be able to FULLY FUND your 401(k) ($18.5k pre tax) and still live very comfortably.

In my experience, this varies by company. One company allowed me to keep exactly one week of PTO; my current employer doesn make me touch vacation or personal days, but I need to use sick days since FMLA is (for me) covering medical conditions or procedures. It was jarring moving from one company to my current workplace, because re qualifying for FMLA after using most of my available time the year before required me to work two months straight without an absence. 
It helps, since gy the end of it you get +4 to all stats, but if you have a glass cannon for example, and the last 2 stats to get a +1 is like DEF and RES, it not really going to help you that much.

And aromatherapy is a health practice or an alternative medicine that is designed to cure a person from sickness using essential oils. Aromatic plants are gathered to extract very concentrated oils to be used during aromatherapy sessions. Even sinus infection can be cured by aromatherapy. All you need to do is to make a sinus oil blend, and use it. Here's how to cure your sinus problem using aromatherapy.

Old Hunter Bone could be the key indeed! I was surprised I had to scroll down to the end for this golden tip. I think the key lies in focus. Don try to do too many things at once. Forget about the oil urns / fire paper etc. Don try to parry as it will get you killed. Just get through the first phase normally, which after some practice shouldn be the problem. In the second phase, fight in the ocean so you have time to see the lightning coming. Use a quick weapon, for example the sword of the Kirkhammer and nothing else. Save all your Old Hunter Bone uses for the second phase.

For sure, most of the time you are going to find nothing more than nice people who just all have a common interest and are happy to meet others who share them. But the "angry nerd" stereotype is real and is getting more and more vocal these days, and there a lot of gatekeeping going on as well. It can be a crapshoot, because for every heartwarming story you hear there is also one where someone felt like they were scolded out of the room for not being the "right" kind of fan. I hope he can try going again to a Comic Con or a convention like that one day, as he should be able to go and have fun!

JF Ptak Science Books Post don have that much to say about the series of images that I found in the 5 December 1908 issue of Scientific American except for "Wow!" Sometimes that is about all I can manage, and that fine. (Richard Feynman, on witnessing the Alamogordo test shot in the desert in 1945, simply said "hot dog!", which was quite a distance away from Oppenheimer reaction, and one which I like more.) Anyway, opening up the volume and by chance opening to this full pager was very pleasantly surprising, and this from a journal which was very successful in achieving their constant goal of being "surprising". As you can well see, "wow" can be shared:The bird view has a peculiar 3D sense to it you could make any of the bridges pop to life by changing your angle of perspective, like so:Continue reading "A Glorious Issue of Scientific American featuring NYC (1908)".

The next level is probably the light rail systems such as the DLR in London with 38km of track.

Of course, since then, President Obama has made a lot of choices that change nothing and actually make many things worse. Obama chose not to pursue the Bushies for their crimes  from torture to lying to the American people and Congress. Obama chose to listen to the likes of Ben Bernanke and Larry Summers and bail out banks rather than the people. And Obama has escalated the American war in Afghanistan and not ended the war in Iraq.
1) Ole Schemion  sort of underrated player but such a fucking beast. His ability to bluff catch is unmatched. I seen so many beautifully played hands on the ept by him. He just senses weakness in other players and pounces on it. His range is always well balanced and he is wise enough to always make a good fold. He is not as devoted to the game as I believe he once was, which means I dont think he will ever lead the all time money list, but in my mind, he the best.
And then the fun stopped   Pain began. Now i mentioned in my preview my fear of the wind being a foe that could be constantly in our face given a point to point race. I didnt mention the wind in yesterday's post, which was reasonably strong coming off the ocean into our face, but it certainly didnt feel worse than anything we have felt early this season in Toronto. Today things changed a bit. From mile 95 to mile 106, we were to climb another 4500 feet. But think about this, dotted throughout this area were windmills   THIS WAS A BLOODY WIND FARM!!!! WE WERE GOING TO BE CLIMBING 4500 FEET STRAIGHT INTO A BIG FREAKIN FAN. This had to be the toughest climb i have faced. Jason, one of the Carmichael coaches had taken me under his big wing the last two days, pushing me hard to dig deep and attack these climbs   this guy climbs with ease, makes all of this look real easy but has figured out in short order how to motivate me to keep pushing hard. He hauled my butt up this mountain, pushing through 20 degree pitches (hopefully some of you saw the pros making their way through this, astounding to me how they powered up this) providing a draft, yes a draft despite the fact I probably wasnt going more than 6 8km/hr. Unfortunately I have to guess on all of this as my garmin ran out of battery at 160km, so I missed all of this great climbing.
The swinging, swashbuckling move should have worked because that classic pirate movie action. I think the GM forgot that everything we "know" about pirates is a fabrication.

What I see in the West (mind you, I never lived in the East, only studied them from afar) is a deep hunger for compassion. The main place in the East I see compassion is from Buddhism.

Druids were apparently a feature of Gaulish, Irish and British religious and political life, but as far as I know there isn evidence for them existing in other Celtic regions like Hispania. Based on place names, Celtic speaking peoples also venerated sacred groves (nemeton in Gaulish; nemed in Old Irish) as well as oak trees (from Proto Celtic daru ). This can be seen as far as Asia Minor, where we told that the Galatians (speakers of a Gaulish dialect) met in a holy place called Drunemeton to judge murder cases; Drunemeton literally just means "sacred oak grove" in Gaulish.

We know that the SBS whistleblower deliberately did not submit their evidence to the police.

A holdout is any device used to secretly bring a card from outside the game into the player's hand. Often, the cheater will pull the card out of the game and into the holdout for later use, to be sure the holdout card matches the rest of the deck being used. These can be placed inside sleeves ("an Ace up your sleeve," and "What have you got up your sleeve?"   two more expressions for which we can thank the world of poker), under the table, on a chair, or in a player's shirt. Some are elaborate mechanical device; some are simply a pocket where the cheat can store the card using slight of hand.

Worse part is, on very rare occasions I can actually hear mumbling of a voice when music isn't playing like it's a radio DJ. The moment I actively try to echolocate the direction of the sound, it goes away completely. I've also suffered from very bad misophonia since I was about 13.

Like I said, that out around Boston. Our Mass politicians like to forget that central and especially western Mass exist at all. Boston has plenty of options while Berkshire County (which is a large, rural county in western Mass) only has dial up for the many in the county.

If you're single and not dipping your toes into serious substance abuse, doing the happy hour circuit might be a fun distraction for a limited amount of time. But making it a required, nearly daily event that involves getting drunk every night has crossed the line into the habitual behaviors of alcoholism. It probably seems totally normal to those involved in that scene, but to the rest of society, it's waaaaaay over indulgent, and it seems self serving to insist that it's "part of work culture". Furthermore, there ends up being a LOT of serious substance abuse issues within that culture; alcoholism being the obvious. But there's also lots of cocaine and benzos in that scene: cocaine to extend the drinking capabilities, and Xanax to wind down and pass out so as to get to work the next weekday morning.

I feel like there are so many hair memos I missed. I moved from a very casual rural community to a fashionable city, and I was legit confused about how everyone's hair was so sleek and glossy for a loooong time.

The two brothers pictured in the photo later told police that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack because he wanted a raise and to further his career, prosecutors allege.

In order to be a full time player you have to know you can sustain a lifestyle at it. If you're uncertain you're not there yet.

I averaged about 5 6k net a month which is higher than my full time job.
