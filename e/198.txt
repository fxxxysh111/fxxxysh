However if I were in your shoes, instead on focusing on your husband I would focus on optimizing my routine, maybe there are things that you should delegate, or stop doing all together, maybe there is something were you pushing yourself too hard for no good reason.

After that my midgame and endgame has still to do a lot and there the main difference is that I have more experience / know more patterns and have a better evaluation for the patterns. Many of the standard things they know as well, so often they make as good moves as I do and sometimes they beat me because the game just happens to have those patterns that they know and are able to evaluate correctly.

We know that the SBS whistleblower deliberately did not submit their evidence to the police. Suddenly, magically, the police manage to find their own evidence, except it was allegedly delivered in a format that easy to fabricate. And they don want to reveal how they got it, well you gotta protect any potential witnesses, right? Except the witness that chose to go to the media and the ACRC avoided dealing with the police. I wonder why that is?
The dealers told us that this same guy ran his KK into another player AA for something like $2500 effective stacks. After the board ran out all bricks, he asked the AA player for his money back, that it was his rent money and he couldn lose it, and please please can we just chop the pot? The AA player calmly explained that if he had the KK and supertilter had AA, he would have fairly paid him off, and that it was unfair for him to ask for his money back..

The sampling rate is 30kHz; this means that the number of voltage measurements that we collect is 30,000 per second and this streams continuously in real time while Ian uses the system. We have to use signal processing methods to mathematically translate the "raw" voltage data into normalized response intensity that we can use as neural features for our machine learning decoder algorithms.

LBP is common, costly, and a significant cause of long term sick leave and work loss. Many different interventions are available, but there exists no consensus on the best approach.

I completely agree that beautiful is too vague a term to use in this context. Maybe what I meant to say is smooth and flowing. I enjoy languages that don have harsh consonants that are too far back in the mouth. I think good examples of these harsh consonants would be Arabic and German. I not sure if trills would interrupt flow compared to no trills at all though. French and Italian both share the quality that, unlike English, they give each syllable the same length of sound. Maybe that would help with the flow as well. The only problem I have with Italian is the overuse of the same vowels in nearly every syllable. On another note I also love the Received Pronunciation English accent, and I not sure how I could incorporate this into it.

Two aces two eights, called a dead man's hand. This term is also used for a hand that is very good, but not a winner (so you are definitely going to lose money on it). Example: You are holding AA in Holdem, and the flop brings AKK. Now if your opponent is holding KK, which gives him four of a kind, you are holding a deadman's hand, since you are very likely to put lots of money in the pot, or even go allin, with a losing hand. In this case the "5 of a kind" is the highest possible hand but will rarely be found in live poker games. Wild card poker can be found more in Video Poker games. (Full Answer)

So one of the great veneers of civilization that everyone knows about the Romans was their baths   they some of the most famous architectural projects of the Romans, barring things like the Colosseum. These complexes were more than just bathtubs   they were three part swimming pools for an entire spa regimen, from the locker room where you stored your clothes (or stole other people clothes   there are plenty of curse tablets that call down the wrath of the Furies on those who stole their clothes at the bath), to the warm room, to the sauna, and then a dip in freezing water to refresh you, then a good, long soak in the warm water, slaves rubbing you down with oil and scraping off the sweat and grime of the day, maybe a massage, perhaps some plucking (think waxing/threading), a gym workout, and an overall social experience where everyone naked and civilized about it. They were often used similarly to shopping malls, with the outside wall of the baths being covered in shops selling food, perfumes, clothes, etc.

Also no proof in the affidavit that he solicited anything from the women.

I think it has more to do with self identity. A Tyranid, especially a genestealer, is emotionally "pure". They know exactly who and what they are. No matter how you might feel about them they have their own incredibly intense feelings, but instead of distorting to "become" those feelings, their profound sense of identity as a Tyranid only reinforces their existence as themselves.

Salon Packages A massage therapist often rents space in an upscale beauty salon or spa, and provides her services to the salon's customers along with her own clientele. Creating a two service package with another professional, such as an esthetician or accomplished hair stylist, might result in additional business from clients who would like to enjoy two pampering services at once. The massage therapist markets this enhanced service through bridal shops and prom gown retailers, and provides a referral incentive for her own clients as well.

If we could put legendaries in gyms then you have people crossing their fingers hoping some guy comes along before midnight to wreck their 475 cp Zapdos with a Geodude they caught on the way over so that the coin return comes in time. That just be dumb for legendaries to get getting slapped around by people random garbage.

Well, I guess Froch didn't fancy the fight with Golovkin enough to meet him at a reasonable weight. If Froch wanted that cash bad enough, my guess he'd have found a way to push himself away from the dinner table and to get on the track a little more to take off the weight so he can make that fight happen. I'm not sure how much money Froch is making with poker, but my guess is he's not making the kind of money he would have received for a fight against GGG. The question would the fans still remember Froch and want to see him fight? I think not. Once you're gone, the boxing fans find new fighters to support. In this case, I think they're giving their support to IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua now.

This has potentially interesting consequences in repeated play of the game. We also show that in a simplified version of the game with P>5, there is one equilibrium solution if 5P . This may be the simplest non trivial multiplayer poker game with more than one distinct equilibrium solution and provides us with a test case for theories of dynamic strategy adjustment over multiple realisations of the game.We then study a third order system of ordinary differential equations that models the dynamics of three players who try to maximise their expectation by continuously varying their betting frequencies.

I was tired when I cashed out and it a bit of a long story, but the cashier gave me $900 more money than she should have! How that for a crazy trip? Don worry, I realized the mistake before I ordered my Uber and left and walked back and returned the money.
Finally got a league win over /u/ZabJudahHeart in an epic rocky mirror. Probably like 6 or 7 total kd As is the typical pattern of our fights I built a big points lead early as he worked the body to gradually sap my stamina in order to dominate the second half of the fight. In the last round I had nothing left other than being ahead on the cards and had already been dropped multiple times. In the last few seconds he goes all out and puts me down again for the final time, so it all came down to whether or not I could beat the count. Fortunately Rocky tough ass somehow got up and I got the decision victory in one of the best fights I ever had in this game and in what i consider to be my best league win to date. Had I blown that fight my PS3 might be in pieces right now. Great fight man.

"UKE" KANCER, Jerry November 17,1949   April 15, 2017 Proudly born in Val d'Or Quebec, Jerry had a love of streaking, karaoke, Neil Diamond, the Red Sox and most of all, making people laugh. Son of Walter and Alla, dad and best friend to Jesse. Grandpa to Austin and Sierra (his bumblebees). Jerry loved to travel, make new friends and "yuk it up". He spent many years at Canpar, "drinking the Woodies and delivering the goodies" and once he retired, started taking frequent walks from the couch to the fridge between innings and periods. His house was always open to his friends and you could always find people on Woodworth Drive bonding over losing proline tickets, beers, music, and poker. Always quick to share his dislike of the Blue Jays and Maple Leafs and full of "one liners", Jerry was happiest among his many friends. For details of celebration of life, please call Steph at 905 745 1786.

We've been enjoying poker parties for a little over 3 years now and the 200 TriColor Triple Crown Poker Chip Set with Clear Cover and Aluminum Case has completely changed the atmosphere of our own game.

Auch wenn dieser Glaube zu den naiveren gehrt, ist er nicht nur fr Kinder geeignet. Besonders aus erkenntnistheoretischer Sicht gibt es an ihm interessante Aspekte, weil er sich vielen Problemen stellt, die in anderen Religionen normalerweise unter den Kchentisch gekehrt werden. Zentrales Thema ist die Fragestellung: Was kann ich von meinem Glauben erwarten? Zuzahlungspflichtige Wunderheilungen? Ein gekhltes Bier? Und anders herum: Was muss ich fr meinen Glauben tun? Auch mal einkaufen gehen? Den Khlschrank putzen? Zeige mir, was du in deinem Khlschrank hast, und ich sage dir woran du glaubst.

The first time I played Anthem, I noted that there are five (5!!!) different difficult activities for each expedition.

Lucifer rises, demonstrating his awesome and immense power by the fact that his eyes are a totally different color than all those other demons. 
In poker our tight player gets dealt a pair of aces. This is what he has been waiting for and he comes out guns blazing. On the flop there might be some dangerous cards   such as 2 of the same suit   indicating that another player could have a flush draw. Another card with the same suit comes on the turn. But he ignores this and continues to bet. At the river the opponent turns over a 2,3 suited to the 3 table cards and wins with a low flush. Our ACES man is devasted. He had the much higher hand before the flop  it doesn seem fair! But poker is about the cards both now and in the future.

Mais si la survie consommable est quelque chose qui doit augmenter toujours, c'est parce qu'elle ne cesse de contenir la privation. S'il n'y a aucun au del de la survie augmente, aucun point o elle pourrait cesser sa croissance, c'est parce qu'elle n'est pas elle mme au del de la privation, mais qu'elle est la privation devenue plus riche.

I learned at the age of 34 that I am naturally left handed by taking up wing tsun! It based on very small but precise movements of the hands while maintaining a very rigid structure. Because of the individual practice for both left and right sides in certain parts, I was surprised to be far more natural and proficient on my left. Saying this in passing one day, my father explained to me he is left handed but had it beat out of him by the priest at school because the devil. I wouldn consider myself a dancer or indeed able to remember a routine. Wing tsun has given me a map to follow and I can now pick up a series of movements in minutes while being able to describe the sequence from memory, something I never been able to do. I now working on the wooden dummy and it has given me a reference for fighting like nothing else. Wild punches or kicks don frighten me anymore, all I see is a shape and a response, it like I now have a translation. The mentality of always moving forward is also brilliant. I know sometimes it sold as forward energy or force, but don be put off by that. Its quite a scientific approach to fighting but there is so so much to explore. The first form, si lim tao, the sequence can be learned quite quickly, but you could spend years doing it every day and still learn something new, I highly recommend trying it!

I don question that porn affects some people relationships negstively, but assuming all porn usage by all people in relationships negatively impacts their relationship is a ludicrous idea. That just as fanatical as saying alcohol consumption inevitably leads to alcoholism, and it is really rude to presume that there is a problem without knowing how and why someone consumes something.

As this column has long maintained, few brands know the art of delivering peerless service in a market where virtually every consumer up and down the chain is crying out for better treatment from the businesses they support. If Singapore could own service, education and training as a key element of its national brand, it would fill a niche that only Japan can currently lay claim to. Its national carrier alone has enough senior management to take over training contracts for other airlines, cruise ship companies, hotel groups and retailers. 
So does anyone ever ask why they are doing this? Like I went to a local DSA meeting and everyone was talking about their kids and movie night at the new support group for lgbtq plus and going to happy hour and laughing and having beers after. And I just couldn help but think, the reason that we want all these things to change is because we love people and know the good and the beauty that humans are capable of, if every human treats every other human with respect, dignity, and compassion. what sucks is that that is such a distant dream, and we been trained to think that human nature is what capitalism has fed us as "reality" but the fact that some of us have , that dream means the human race is evolving and it depending on us to keep that strain going. So yes getting out there and being with people and sharing the struggle is important, but it also important to just be out there relieving suffering even if the political messages fall on deaf ears.
So why did Pacquiao refuse to take the damned tests? Pacquiao knows, the rest of us can only speculate. I feel that it is a combination of things. First and foremost he refused point blank to get pushed around by Mayweather. Understandable! Secondly he did not want his all important training schedule interrupted by unannounced, invasive blood takes which could have weakened him at a time he needs all his strength. Thirdly he may believe that Mayweather needs this fight more than he does, and is playing poker not boxing. Mayweather is reportedly close to broke. Even if Pacquiao only makes 10 million dollars from his fight with Clottey, 10 million dollars in Pacquiaos hands in the Philippians is probably the equivalent of 100 million dollars in Mayweathers hands in the US. Pacquiao took the best welterweight challenge available for March 13, leaving Mayweather with very little choice of landing himself a convincing match. This could all be part of a plan so that team Pacquiao can dictate terms if, and when negotiations are reopened between the two teams.
But, as m goes to infinity (which means that the line is becoming vertical), this intersection point is getting closer and closer to x=0.

Wageningen was a small university town in the war (look up the WUR, it the descendant of the old agricultural university). This meant that the town housed a lot of students (mostly men at the time), and at some point during the war some of the students learned that the Germans were gong to call on all able male students who had until then been exempt from work detail to be rounded up for the arbeitseinsatz. One or more of them broke into the city hall at night and stole the municipal register that contained a list of everyone studying and working in Wageningen at that time, the only complete register that existed. 
After of couple of decades owning businesses, I'm no longer convinced that a high tolerance for risk is a good thing. The ups and downs of business ownership can wreak havoc on families.

Meanwhile every good British show is remade by Americans because it considered untenable to have to deal with accents and cultural references they won understand, and you have classic films like The Castle, edited to reference American culture, and cut out Australian references, despite it being a deeply Australian film. If someone never has to engage that sort of critical thinking, or have to frame anything in a new cultural context, it clear why they would struggle with it.

This lone county jail in a remote corner of Appalachia offers an agonizing glimpse into how the tidal wave of opioids and methamphetamines has ravaged America. Here and in countless other places, addiction is driving skyrocketing rates of incarcerated women, tearing apart families while squeezing communities that lack money, treatment programs and permanent solutions to close the revolving door. More than a decade ago, there were rarely more than 10 women in the Campbell County Jail in northeast Tennessee. Now the population is routinely around 60. Most who end up here have followed a similar path: they arrested on a drug related charge and confined to a cell 23 hours a day. Many of their bunkmates also are addicts. They receive no counseling. Then weeks, months or years later, they released into the same community where friends   and in some cases, family   are using drugs. Soon they are again, too. And the cycle begins anew: Another arrest, another booking photo, another pink uniform and off to a cell to simmer in regret and despair. By David Goldman/Associated Press

I don't know. She seems intent to duck the first amendment issues by squarely saying that the problem is with the representations Stone and his counsel made in court. Moreover, defendants are routinely gagged in high profile cases. What if a cop or prosecutor wrote a book, "all the reasons the defendant is guilty" and sought to publish it prior to the trial? I could see some strong reasons to put a hold on the publication. The court likely can't bar its printing, but a reasonable restriction on its time and manner of publication might squeak by.

But too many commentators on the left and the right have accepted the ridiculous idea that the Obama administration is actually socialist. Time to do our homework and show that the Emporer New Clothes may just be the same ol neoliberal con job of making the rich richer gussied up as populist policy.What if the result of all this consolidation of financial power in the hands of a few is that the rich get richer? There is no guarantee that the economic collapse is going to result in a redistribution of wealth, despite the screams of socialism coming from Fox News commentators.In fact, some experts are suggesting that what is really going on is that class interests are being protected by Secretary Geithner and his gang. In other words, there may be a veneer of populism in the new administration rhetoric, but it is disguising the same old class interests and the consolidation of wealth in the hands of the few that has been going on under the guise of neoliberalism for three decades.If Harvey right and what we seeing is the continuation of the consolidation of wealth and assets rather than the reversal of this trend, then it time for an organized and concentrated effort by the media and grass roots movements to reveal what going on.

I know nothing about epidemology or flu pandemics. I do, however, know when panic is being created in order to create a sense of order and calm. This sort of "controlled panic" has a long history in the field of sociology. According to Jackie Orr Panic Diaries, post World War II sociology was filled with people trying to keep order in the face of growing panic. As Americans began to comprehend the threat of nuclear war and the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD  that where we bomb the Russians and they bomb us and we both destroy each other and the world and therefore don bomb anyone. we hope), the social scientists stepped in to turn panic to order.

One of their big arguments is that Jews have been persecuted everywhere, so they need this Jewish state to be able to go to in order to be safe from some future persecution. Setting aside the horrible implications this has for non Jews in Israel, this doesn even make sense on a practical level. The reality of the modern world is that super powers like the US could crush just about any smaller country if they wanted to. The only reason Israel is even relevant to American political discourse is because we propping them up financially/militarily/diplomatically. If tomorrow the US flipped full Nazi and wanted to wipe us out, Israel couldn keep us safe for shit.
