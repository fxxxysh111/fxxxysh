So, while MIL is loudly trying to get everyone to group together, I say nicely, "MIL, I can take the photo since I'm not going to be in it" and open my hand for her camera (yes camera, not a phone). She smiles (kinda wickedly) as if she "knew" she had the upper hand (narrator voice: she didn't) and holds the camera behind her back with both hands (like a kid trying to keep a toy away from another), leans out and says that I'm family and I WILL be in the picture. I responded, no I've already told you I'm not going to be in any photos. She then scowls and says "then WE just won't have a family picture" I said "oh, ok" and walked out to the car, with my kids, DH followed a bit behind. We didn't speak about it at all on drive to airport he knew there was nothing he could say, still haven't discussed it as I think about it. But I'm sure MIL probably said something to him after I walked out.

It would seem like the spa would have balanced rules, like requiring a parent/guardian/approved person to over 16 to supervise but then whatever, or even just having a "girls with women, boys with men" policy, or having the parent sign off on acceptable genders for their kid therapist. For instance, employee dress codes are a frequently cited case of legal sex discrimination, in the sense that the law does discriminate between men and women, but the law does not harm either and is merely intended to specify dress restrictions or requirements. Thus it upheld in court as entirely legal, albeit technically discriminatory, because it does no harm to anyone..

This is unfortunately true. Colluding of players has been regrettably one of the biggest problems of online poker. Two or more players could actually be sharing information with each other during the game via telephone or instant messaging, tricking other players in the hand to give themselves an unfair lead in the game.

Unfortunately, "organic" almost never means "cruelty free". In fact, in order to be labeled "organic" animal welfare plays almost no role (at least in the EU). Separating calves from their mothers, forcefully impregnating milk cows, killing male milk cows for veal, and "destroying" male chicks just minutes after they hatched is still a common practice on organic farms.

In order to understand such a seemingly paradoxical set of relations, it useful to think about when and why sports appeared as a central part of American culture and why.

A dragons' point of view Mr. 
The best theory i read syas that in a hundred years, most countries will have space colonies, which will be used to gather energy and minerals. Far East Asia will be unified as an economic powerhouse, and Europe will have fallen far behind them and the US due to population crunch. Russia will go to war to create a buffer zone in Europe because the using up of fossil fuels in the middle East will make Siberia a big target for other countries. it will be defeated by America, the East Asian alliance, Eastern European alliance, and turkey. the last one will benefit from the fall of geopolitical importance of the middle East after oil runs out, and, with an alliance with Iran, will control most of the middle east and a good chunk of central asia and north africa. it will still be behind Europe industrially and technologically, and will be the major supplier of labour to the then critically undermanned Europe, causing the ethnic ratios to become very skewed.

Why would we continue with Q2 and K2 and fold out the rest when in reality Q2 is the same hand as 24 if his only value hands are A2 and pocket tens? Also, after Eastgate folds, Greenstein should know Eastgate folded a deuce and he has AA so he blocks A2 suited. Now, there is still only 1 combo of A2 suited and 3 combos of TT. Isn AA the same as K2 given your analysis? If we are Greenstein and the board is different where we block all of the A2 suited hands, would we then call?.

My daughter gave up bottles right around a year, one day she just started refusing them and only needed her pacifier to go to sleep   however I do have friends whose kids are the same age and still take bottles at bedtime. I'd say about 50% of them don't use a pacifier. It's really a comfort thing, my daughter is 2.5 and we're starting to think about weaning her from the paci but it's one of the easiest tools to get her to calm down or sleep and she only gets it once a day or if we're on a trip. Other people I know have had a lot of luck introducing comfort objects like a blanket or a lovey but we haven't. I would suggest trying to do something like that because I think it would make the transition away from bottles much easier. Edit to add that I would avoid juice as long as possible. There's no real nutritional benefit and even water is unnecessary until kids start having regular meals. Juice is basically sugar and unless they're sick/struggling to take in fluids my doctor has always said to stay away from it.
Some good advice above. Although I would say that the reasons behind all your symptoms can be many and varied. Increase in intensity can be one, tight lateral leg structures (ITB) can be another, poor saddle to pedal axle relationship meaning you are using smaller weaker muscles instead of prime movers etc etc. as for your back pain, riding position will be very rider specific so be careful of making broad changes. Some people need a perfectly flat backed position to achieve the most stability, but not everybody. There is such variation in peoples spinal posture and deep core muscle control that there is no hard and fast rule for what might be right for you.
Het ontbijt kon pas vanaf 8u, dus voor het ontbijt hebben wij nog een uurtje in Banska Stiavnica rondgewandeld. Berg op, door een soort van park met landhuis in, over een muurtje klimmend (tja, dit toegangspoortje was nog afgesloten), en via een heleboel steegjes en trappen weer naar beneden. Van bovenop de heuvels hadden we goed zicht op de mooie ligging van het stadje. Over het ontbijt waren we heel tevreden: simpel maar vers. Rijdend door een heel groen bosgebied ging het richting snelweg, maar na een paar kilometer maakten we als een stop bij kuuroord Sklene Teplice; achter de ouderwetse kuurgebouwen (waar al de nodige Slowaakse kuurders rondliepen) vonden we een klein riviertje waarin drie hete bronnen uitkwamen, met de nodige kalkafzettingen in roze, oranje en groene tinten. Echt tof, met veel stoom, een beetje a la ijsland. Zeker de moeite voor een bezoekje. Bovenop een heuvel ontstaan door ook zo bron stond nog een kerkje. Wat verder kwamen we dus weer op die bochtige groene autostrade, tot in de industriestad Zsolen.

One of the other major things that made this more phenomenal was definitely the artstyle used for the manga, it was just so well done and really detailed to the core. While I read I could feel the emotion portrayed in the art as it made the scenes actually come to life in my head as I could see what was happening as I read. The use of the words mixed with the art was just an amazing duo and made the manga better than it wanted to be.

It funny how things have flipped. A year ago, I played mystery heroes almost exclusively, because even though I really hate the game mode (duplicates, ultimate steamroll, etc), the people playing almost never said shitty things in the chat. The rare toxic BS was always a day or two after the lootboxes reset, when all of the comp players would come in to get their loot. On the other hand, QP was a non stop battle between people who played QP exclusively (who wanted to win/enjoy the game) and people who were coming from comp to goof around, often making it 5v6.

So no, I think that these women must by necessity carefully protect their identities because of the importance of their cause.

As far as the mom splaining stuff goes, just keep saying that you, your OB and when he time comes your pediatrician have decided that this is the best way to do things.

I started as dimir control its great for beginner's. Not just a casual control/counter magic deck but also has great discard kits. With unmoored ego you learn too much about deck types.

But since i am a newbie that may be have no connection with dimir. But if you got the play unmooring 4 teferis in turn 3 feels amazing, every person shoul experience this.

Sometimes you're just in the mood to relax and not worry about the volume button. Sometimes, you want a movie to be like a massage, transportive and relaxing. Well, look no further. I've culled the depths of Netflix to bring you five relaxing movies that are all very different. And, make no mistake, relaxing isn't synonymous with boring. These movies are simply dialogue driven. You won't find car chases or annoying swagger here. Think of these movies as the exact opposites of flicks like The Fast and the Furious or The Avengers.

My daughter said she wants us to leave my wife, but I don know how it would be feasible. Surely my wife would get the kids as I work full time and she doesn I can reduce my hours to be at home more either. I really don want to lose my daughter when she leaves though. My son doesn seem to be that bothered by her behaviour but we don speak much.

The system literally paired us with the players who had the worst possible stats to ensure that our winrate stays close to 50%.

The places I go in Germany feature super hot women in their 20s and early 30s, and the sex is usually (but not always) damn fun. I also talk to the girls as extensively as I can. Most are from Romania, with Italy, Spain, Hungary, Ukraine, Germany, Latvia, and Greece showing up as well. The girls are very frank and realistic about their job and its risks/benefits. Most view it as an unglamorous but welcome opportunity to change their lives. They come to Germany anywhere from 2 weeks at a time to 8 months on a stretch. They will sleep in the same room where they work to save money (as the rooms are rented by the day), and they focus on working as much as possible to maximize what they take home. They usually make me feel welcome as a customer, have empathy for my motivations for being there, and try genuinely hard to make the experience satisfying. I try to be the nicest, most respectful customer they see that day, and I always pay more than they ask for. There are plenty of men in the world who can find a regular partner, or simply don want one. Brothels are an outlet for them and this place sounds fairly non threatening, although 20x in a night would need a lotta lube!

It's a clear angle shot which by definition is very poor etiquette! And if it were my house, that's a call. Your opponent deliberately conveyed a "call" in order to elicit you to expose your hand. You said it's common practice at this house game that chips don't actually move on actions. You should express to the House owner the issue and that a rule needs to be implemented for the integrity of the game. Rules are, in nature, there to prevent angle shots.

We'll discuss how to choose the right plastic surgeon (these professionals have been performing certain hair replacement procedures for 35 years!), how to choose the right procedure and what to expect before and after surgery. We'll also look at medications and the latest in wigs and hair additions. A word of caution: There is no quick or sure fire way to replace your dwindling follicles with a full, thick head of hair. So it's important that your expectations are realistic and that you exercise patience while you explore your options. Good luck!

Local Malians, similar to their counterparts in many other francophone African countries, were already following French races and placing bets through local operators, so PMU was able to benefit from the vestiges of a colonial pastime to organize a previously unstructured market by offering an official agreement to provide French horse race betting.

Argentinean races, for example, could be offered during the late evening and in the winter in France, when local races may not be available.

Mariah Carey's staggering 5 octave vocal range is one of her most recognizable trademarks. Her angelic voice is stunning. Not only is she a seasoned diva who has rightfully earned her top spot as one of the greatest female pop singers of the 2000s, but she is one of the greatest vocalists of all time.

Have you ever seen that movie Boiler Room? Where Giovanni Ribisi is this young college kid running tables in his apartment at all hours of the night? Well, if you haven't seen it, you're missing out, but if you have, the character he played is me. 
I like to preface saying that most things are easier said than done, I dont expect this to magically solve things, and having been 15 I can only imagine the weight this has on you right now. But keep in mind that this is now your responsibility. You get the freedom to turn it into whatever you want and to decide to focus from now on on the beautiful things you do like about yourself. Someone else said something similar, but inner beauty really shines through. Even if in your head you don like how you look you have to believe that by being a good person others will be attracted to you. Ugly innards make ugly people, and the reverse is also true. Think theres a Shel Silverstein picture about that. I believe in your ability to define yourself and love yourself, and I believe if you keep trying new things that potential futures will become apparent. I love you, and expect you to stay strong.

This all then leads me to be even more skeptical of education systems which are, increasingly, designed to put students into auto pilot, doing busy work and basic social or "alternative intelligence" skills. 
So many people are focusing on flop exploits right now, but totally neglecting turns/rivers. In live games those 1bb/100 flop exploits aren worth near the bb/100 winrate your turn/river exploits can generate..

Its probably losing money when you 4bet bluff/shove these hands, because you are either flipping or absolutely destroyed by the top of their range. Try sticking to only flatting their 3bets with 22 99, its even fine to cold call a 3bet if you think the original raiser is unlikely to 4bet the 3bettor, in fact you will give the original raiser better pot odds to get into the hand which will in turn give you even better implied/pot odds to set mine. Sometimes the original raiser will 4bet but more often than not they will just flat as well.

""Advocates for a $15 minimum wage should look before they leap," said Ryan Young, a CEI fellow. "A higher minimum wage has real world tradeoffs. It is not a free benefit. A higher wage will force employers to reduce non wage pay such as insurance, breaks and personal time off, free meals or parking, and more. Why? Common sense tells you that when you raise the cost of something, anything, less of it will be used or consumed. It a fundamental precept of economics. And labor is no different. It is perhaps no coincidence that these three states have the highest state minimum wages in the nation. It an actual issue in place in the Middle East, as well as others. In America, women are NOT oppressed anymore. They have the same rights as men. There is no difference in pay for the same job. (The "72 Cents to a man dollar" stat is used incorrectly. It refers to the average earnings to all men and all women, and it NOT a reflection of actual wages. This is caused not by discrimination, but by the fact that men: Tend to work in physically demanding and dangerous jobs more than women (and these jobs tend to pay pretty well) and are generally more aggressive when negotiating raises. Also, stay at home moms are more prevalent than stay at home dads, so that means there are less women in the workforce.) 4 points  submitted 5 days ago

Surely 7 hours at school socialising with the same age vs 9 hours at home socialising with +/  ages would kind of make this statement redundant? Your statement mostly appeals to the social impact of age mixed classes, implying that maintaining same age classes helps social development however, social periods (breaks and lunches) are completely varied in ages, particularly in secondary school boasting a huge age leap from 12 to 16 year olds.

Saludos Amigos is a Disney film made predominantly for the South American market in 1943. It intersperses short animated scenes with clips from a live action documentary.

The third point is that we tend to get scared of and mystified by technologies like AI.
