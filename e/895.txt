What "belief"? "Don make shit up" is not some kind of crazy special ideology. Retarded comparison but I happy for you that you found a way to feel superior to "both sides". I was been a bit of a butt there, apologies. Just seems like people are so religious in their atheism that it becomes a form of tribalism, and I think tribalism is a great force of evil in the world. Atheism is probably bottom of the list of evils, but tribal thinking is not good, and it seems from my observations that atheism often seems to fall into this. According to the logic of this fallacy we would have to accept the belief in unicorns as reasonable just because we can disprove them.

For that size house, it normally would take me 2 3 hours of nonstop deep cleaning, including all floors, dusting and cleaning ceiling fans, washing dishes and putting them away. My fee also includes any laundry that you may need washed, and I will dry, fold/hang up and put away. I normally charge a little bit more for laundry services however I am including it in my services for no extra charge for all new clients!
Like I said, it's one thing to say "I'm not attracted to black women because features" or even "I don't find poor, fat black women attractive". Instead, they say "I don't find black women (as a whole) attractive" because in their minds, this is what black women are. The commenters here are patting themselves on the back and letting out sighs of relief because they "aren't racist, they just can't help who they're attracted to" while turning around and blaming their lack of attraction on what boils mostly down to stereotypes and poor perceptions of black women. I'm not overly attracted to black men, but my reasons aren't "yeah I'm not attracted to black men, they're criminals, usually poor and their hair looks like shit".

I totally agree with you. The position of power that priests have attracts people who want to use that position of power. The original comment insinuates that anybody deprived of sex will start to feel attracted towards young boys or girls which is not only false but quite a disturbing view on sexual nature altogether. Priests have the backing of God and sadly there are even cases where parents have found out about sexual misconduct towards their children and will still take the side of the church through their blind following of faith. Original commenter needs to take a look at their view on sexual nature as this almost seems to remove some of the blame from those who abuse by making it seem that they are normal people caught I a bad situation rather than predators who seek a position of power with forethought and malice

The plan was really just a way for the military to get around the looming 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which made it illegal to test weapons in the upper atmosphere and in the ocean. The Sedan Test was Operation Plowshare's second test and it was, in scientific terms, a son of a bitch. The bomb was placed underground in a remote section of the Nevada desert in the hopes that nobody would notice. But the nuclear bomb erupted out of the earth like a pissed off radioactive volcano, releasing the seismic equivalent of a 4.75 earthquake and launching 6.6 million cubic yards of radioactive earth into the atmosphere.

I did exactly that in my junior year in high school. I never could perfect my embouchure on the clarinet. Although I didn't have a problem with speed or accuracy, my tone just sucked. So I began to play saxophone instead, and picked it up pretty quickly. The upper register on a clarinet is the lower register on a saxophone, which makes it easier to transpose the notes mentally. (I picked up the sax because I was bored with the clarinet   plus they wouldn't let me in the jazz band with a clarinet   even though I mentioned klesmer music to them, they weren't interested.)The embouchure on the sax is dependent upon the lower jaw. When learning to perfect your tone, concentrate on the tightness and angle of the lower jaw. You can actually change the tone by raising and lowering the jaw to produce a vibrato. Different notes require different angles, because like all wind instruments, not every note will be in tune at the same time. Certain notes are consistently sharp when the sax is in tune, so the player knows to drop their jaw. When trying to hit those lowest notes, relax the jaw as much as possible   the reed has to vibrate at a slower frequency, and if the jaw's too tight, it'll choke the sound and stop the vibration.

Those kids need therapy(abusive, addict father who abandoned them, messy parental split, moved around a lot   look up ACE tests, they aren everything but higher scores tend to be a sign of more trauma).

The little girl mom knows   that who matters. Mom is the one you don keep secrets from. Grandma may have GPR but that isn the same as being a parent. Suggestion to bio mom for getting kids into therapy is meet evil MIL at their pediatrician office   tell the pediatrician about dad history the 911 call, DR should be on board with therapy, MIL can argue in front of the doctor or she look right crazy, so kids get therapy. Getting therapy is in the best interests of the kids and if she fights it at least it is good fodder to show a judge later on, showing that she doesn have their best interests at heart. So that is sort of win/win.

Even with a flush on the board in Texas Hold'em the players can still use their hold cards to form the five card hand. This is important since if a player holds a matching suit it may be higher than one of the cards on the board. If the highest rank matches, then compare the second, and third and so on. For example: Board: As Ks 9s 7s 2s Jim: 8c 5d Tam: Ts Th Jim's Hand is thus: As Ks 9s 7s 2s Tam's Hand is however: As Ks Ts 9s 7s You can thus see in the third position Tam has a higher valued card and is the winner of the pot. If neither player has a higher hand then the pot is simply split. (Full Answer)

Set (metaphorical) traps. An old saying describes cunning as "finding the path that your enemy has chosen, then digging holes along that path." Though it's highly unlikely that you'll ever have to set real traps for anyone, take the metaphor to heart. By judging another's strengths, weaknesses, and motivations, you can ascertain the "path" they are on and sabotage it for your personal benefit. Look for ways to exploit your enemy's weaknesses while rendering their strengths useless. Try to put your enemies in situations where they're likely to mess up.

Because you have a pair of queens, you must assume that if either of the other two queens hit, it will improve your hand to make you the winner. There are also three remaining aces that will improve you to two pair. This makes five outs. In addition, if any club hits, it will give you an ace high flush. So you have nine other outs (the remaining clubs). This gives you 14 outs. Now you have seen five cards (your hole cards and the three on the flop) out of a 52 card deck. This leaves 47 unseen cards before the turn. This means that 14 out of 47 cards can come on the turn and improve your hand, and 33 will not help you at all. This makes the odds roughly 2.4 to 1.

Readers get an early glimpse of that trauma in the opening pages when Stout, the narrator, says: "My mother died when I was a young boy, a tragedy my dad and I shared but rarely talked about. It was an open wound that refused to heal." Given the intense demands of his father's practice at the local hospital, Stout is compelled to learn what it means to be alone; he spends a lot of time in the kitchen, yearning for his mother's presence. Even so, father and son share an enduring closeness, nurtured in part by their shared enthusiasm for poker. For years, on Friday evenings, both bond over so called gambleathons in which no real money changes hands but still are fiercely competitive. As Stout says, "Gloating was permitted. Poor sportsmanship was discouraged."

The only minor difference that you missed is that instead of being a seven sided strike inna build, it now a wave of light inna build that functions like a tankier but slower sunwuko wave of light build. But really almost any of the 6 piece set builds is T13 viable now, which I actually find quite nice, because of the encouraged build diversity. It also important to note that starting in season 14, there have been seasonal buffs added. Season 14 was double goblin spawn, season 15 was double blood shards, and this season all characters have the RoRG buff without it equipped or in cube. With that in mind, I find the N6M4 demon hunter very fun personally, so maybe give that a try instead of impale.

I didn find out about that until months later, as I was out of country at the time. I did both paintings as a follow along while the show was live on TV, I didn have a VCR or anything and the picture was grainy. My point here is anyone can paint his stuff and you love it for life.
Yeah, claws are fucking scary as hell. Those things are pure destruction. So is the mouth of the dogs mentioned and other big breeds. The pain threshold of a lot of these animals is high. Plenty of people have stories of how their cat swiped at a German Shepherd and the dog went scampering away. I also seen happily bloodied dogos after a boar hunt and its gnarly as fuck. When my 65 pound dog would get into aggressive fights over a pig ear, I don really want to know what it is like with a Turkish Mastiff losing its shit. Cougars aren roaming around getting into fights. They are stealth hunters. They would almost never find themselves in a situation where they are fighting an animal of equal size. A good couple gashes and they are probably winning, but if a mastiff got a hold of that neck and clamped down, that could easily be lights out.

Muscle building is all about managing insulin and blood sugar so that you elevate insulin at the right time with the right nutrients available for protein synthesis.

Eat it with fruits, vegetables, or spices that enhance glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity.

Why would competing and trying your hardest be immoral? Of course my goal is to take as much money as possible, using anything within the rules to do so. But how can you say there is no moral code to poker like any game or competition? Are there not cheaters? Are there not angleshooters?

Secondly, I like to take a new look at all the mysteries that I once just had to accept on faith. What does it mean to be in the image of God Unsurprisingly   it means exactly that. Humans were made to resemble the physical characteristics of the gods, exactly like the Babylonian and Sumerian creation myths. Why does God use the plural when creating humans? Because in the other Semitic myths, the creation of humans was carried out by a team of gods. Why was Yahweh unable to drive out the Canaanites who had iron chariots, and why were the Israelites defeated by the Moabites after their king sacrificed his son to Chemosh? Because at that time, Yahweh was not all powerful and could be defeated by the gods of other tribes.

More generally, I think conspiracy theories have a kernel of healthy skepticism of how economic and political power works, but they actually contribute to the abuse of power because they obscure it.

Conscious creativity happens when the ego identification no longer prevents life from celebrating itself.My vision of the future:The purpose of life for the human body/mind is not to be a predictable, programed repetition of other ignorant peoples believes, knowledge or behaviors, but to be a temporary tool to manifest and express the presence of awareness, the unconditional love, the bliss, the peace, the formless form of life that we are.I am really good at:Assisting people in understanding the subconscious mind and its programming and in utilizing their intelligence and the five senses of the body to clearly discover the illusion of identification with body, emotions and mind.

A lot of more "conservative" fields require this, if not explicitly then at least by "tradition". Law, for example, is pretty much run by old conservative men. If us women want to be taken seriously we need to play the game, and in this case unfortunately the game requires heels and skirt suits. I once witnessed a female lawyer getting berated for wearing a pants suit in court by an older judge. Sure, she didn see any concrete consequences from it (he was mostly "joking"), but you can bet your ass the jury took note of the tone and knew not to take her seriously. And I sure the judge attitude made him less likely to take her objections or motions into account.

This game was hardly decided on penalties. The larger factors were Brady having fewer targets, Brady trying to force it down the field when he has little to no downfield accuracy anymore/little to no good downfield targets, the lack of a good offensive line presence to start any good running plays, and a defense that truly blew giving up huge run plays, long range pass plays, and (IIRC) the Pats went negative in the turnover margin (too lazy to confirm).

I care. We should all care. Criminal acts are generally related to life circumstances that put people in tremendously stressful situations. The young man sentenced here had been shot the year before, presumedly by someone associated with intended victim, or perhaps by the intended victim himself. The pressures associated with navigating gang politics are daunting. If, for example, you are from a certain neighborhood, rival gangs may see you as legitimate target despite any gang affiliation which only further pressure you join a gang for self preservation.
The biggest draw, to me, toward the Apocalypse Engine over something more in depth is the way the game is made to stay fast and loose in favor of keeping the story flowing.
