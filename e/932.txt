A place to begin to explain Washington's current dysfunctional condition is the basic design of American political institutions, notably, the presidential system that allocates the executive and legislature independent powers. In contrast to a parliamentary system of fused powers, the separation of powers creates a built in, that is, structural, potential for gridlock when each branch is controlled by an opposing party. The Constitution specifies that, in order for legislation to be adopted, a bill must be voted by both houses of Congress and approved by the President. This requirement invites deadlock when opposing parties control different political institutions. Moreover, Congressional procedures further constrain reform. For example, the Senate's current filibuster rule specifies that a super majority   60 of the 100 member body   must support bringing a measure to the floor for a vote. In the House, the Speaker (that is, the leader of the majority party in the chamber) can prevent proposals from being scheduled for a vote. During the recent imbroglio over the fiscal cliff, House Republican Speaker John A Boehner refused to allow the House to vote on a measure passed by the Senate and supported by the President.

Common sense tells us that the key to succeeding in a triathlon is swimming, riding or running as fast as possible   but only up to a certain point. Unless you're competing in a sprint triathlon (a fraction of the length of an Ironman triathlon), you can't possibly go full tilt for the entire race. Learning to pace yourself is therefore a critical element of triathlon training. Over exerting yourself in one of the three legs will likely cause you to burn out for the rest of the race, while taking it too slow will leave you in the back of the pack.

Whether wages will rise will depend, in part, on how much greater demand companies will see as the economy recovers. A significant rise in demand may prompt companies to increase hiring and wages to attract or retain talent, some experts say.

These narrowed areas are called strictures. Strictures may be mild or severe, depending on how much they obstruct the passage of the bowel's contents. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction include crampy abdominal pain, frequently associated with vomiting, and bloating. Medications may relieve the obstruction by reducing the local area of inflammation. If the obstruction is severe and does not respond to medical treatment, surgery may be required. Surgery also may be indicated if the blockage recurs frequently.

Obtaining a comprehensive thyroid panel is essential to rule thyroid as a possible cause of depression. The medical literature has discovered a link between low T3 and long standing depression.

This person violated you (and your BIL/SIL) in a horrendous manner. If you don't start a paper trail you could be very potentially fucked over for years to come. Grandparents rights, visitation, access to a kid she literally forced upon you (even though I'm certain you will love it once it's here) frequent CPS calls, stalking, harassment.

The first wheels had a zero and a double zero. In 1843 a German casino removed the double zero to compete with other casinos by not screwing their customers quite so badly. American casinos took one look at their customers and put that double zero right back on there. And then added a triple zero. And in a parody of the Patriot Act over a century before the fact, they called the third zero "American Eagle" so people couldn't complain about it. U S A! U S A!
Probably, but part of the problem with estimating it is a lack of writing in many of the societies in the Americas before then.
More likely he acquired his reverse noblesse oblige by training from his father who, according to Trump biographer Harry Hurt III, raised young Donald to become "a killer" and told him "you are king."

This is the thing that I think people don understand as to why I love The Orville versus Discovery or Reboot Trek: one of the reasons I like Star Trek was because it was a scrappy underdog of a show doing the most difficult genre to make look good on a shoestring budget and impart a positive worldview.
Another way to kill a pregnant female Sim is to wait until their hunger is really low, it won't necessarily be rock bottom (because they are pregnant and their needs decay quicker and die quicker), but then they will drop to the floor and the grim reaper will come and take care of the rest. 
Andrew was being a maniac, but happened to actually have AAxx in this hand and the other guy had KKxx and sucked out.V: Kid, I made more money in the last hour playing with you than you make in a fucking year. Then he pulls out three $10k chips from his pocket, slams them on the table, and says, let play for fucking rolls.The table goes dead silent in the change of tone.Turns out that this quiet guy was a huge techie who was worth $100M+ (one of the big tech credit card processors like Stripe or something).Anyways, as expected, Andrew went into his shell, kept drinking, and pissed away his remaining stack by the end of the night before stumbling out the card room.

As a former alcoholic and DUI offender myself, having been through DUI programs and treatment centers where suspended and revoked licenses are the norm, having your car registered in someone else name, or just driving someone else car (friend, family, significant other, etc), or trading cars with someone, is the status quo for people who intend to drive without a license. People who are so desperate they go ahead and drive with bogus plates are the exception, not the norm.

Almost all of the countries that are pointing fingers at Germany for acting in it own interests happily trade with autocratic governments like Saudi Arabia, Brazil or China and also did not try to help during the refugee crisis and just sent a lot of the refugees to Germany (I don like how Merkel handled it either, but that anither story).

This reduces down to 6 to 1 odds (12 divided by 2 equals 6, and 2 divided by 2 equals 1). Once again the correct play is to call. Notice that at this time, if you don't improve on the river, you can fold, and if you do improve, you can bet or raise..

Operation Extended Capital began its life as Operation Capital. After the disastrous defeat for the Japanese at the dual battles at Imphal and Kohima, the British 14th Army had chased them back into Burma. After the successful crossing of the Cindwin river, the stage was now set for a climactic battle on the plains on the northern side of the Irrawaddy river. But, that not what happened. The Japanese commander, Shihachi Katamura, pre empted this and moved his forces on the other side of the river. Katamura now had the defensive advantage.

There plenty wrong with the justice system. There plenty wrong with DREs and the prevalence of pseudoscience in the courts, though the latter is at least as likely to get an acquittal or false finding of incompetence as it is to get a conviction. But if THIS is an example of our terrible system working against the poor, I not sure how worried I am. It looks a bit more like one mildly questionable exercise of prosecutorial discretion that going to end in nothing much of consequence. Update: According to Seven Days, the SA declined the DUI referral and instead charged negligent driving. This seems totally normal and appropriate. The purpose of that misdemeanor is to attach negative consequences to careless driving. No question, this is a moving story about a hard working guy who just trying to hold things together for his family, in circumstances where the littlest setback could tip him into unemployment. But it a story about rural poverty and disadvantage miscast as jeremiad about the justice system. The justice system worked as it should. And once it gets off this poor guy back, as it quickly will, he still need a kind of help the justice system can give.

And I counter; Being shipwrecked means you have to survive first. You are not going to wake up "completely fine" from being beached just after the boat you on wrecks, nor is this scenario guaranteed to land you close to the nearest town.

The time in which the animal exhibits immobility is used as a barometer of despair, indicating that the animal has succumbed to a fate of drowning (1).

While it may feel overwhelming to think about how you might go about rewilding the world, rewilding the land where you live   your town, your neighborhood, maybe even just your own yard   isn't so daunting.

Go one more step and work with your neighbors and your community to tie your efforts together. If you and your neighbor both go native with your yards, and you plant back to back, you've just doubled the size of your reforestation efforts.

There are actually two different games, depending on whose house we're at. If we're at the brash, aggressive guy's house, we buy in for five bucks. If we lose, we can buy in again for five bucks.
