Girl get yourself some fish oils!! I was having so many problems with my hair; it was breaking off, looking dry and frizzy, and would NOT grow past my collar bone for a solid 6 years. Then I started taking 3 6 9 fish oils with every meal and keeping up with my biotin (remember not to take it longer than 3 weeks as it can really mess with your B12 levels if taken for too long) and my multivitamins. Then i kept up with just general good hair practices: never sleep with it in a bun or pony tail (french braid if you absolutely have to) and don wash it too much, which i was SO bad for. I would wash my hair EVERY DAY and have switched to every other day at the most, sometimes every 3 days. And if you use any heat styling like blow dryers or hair straighteners, get yourself a really good heat protectant. I like the Bumble Bumble Hairdresser Oil Primer the best. After doing all of this, in the course of about 5 months I gained probably 4 inches of length to my hair and it so beautiful and shiny! I haven had it cut since November and there only a few tiny split ends here and there.

This is how I run Hexblades in my world   typically they are the souls of demon princes long trapped within a blade, who bind with their users out of necessity rather than out of their own free will. They are trapped within the blades by devils who use the blades as a psychological warfare tactic to demoralize demon hoards by fighting against them with their own princes. Sometimes a weapon of such calibre rises to the material plane and finds itself in the possession of a warrior who gets seduced by its pact, promises of power and loyalty to its user, often in exchange for revenge against the lord who contained it and possibly even release from its prison..

I guessing the latter since in humans the head is the limiting factor, while in centaurs their heads are smaller than horse heads.

Believe it or not ppl would still go to school for music, theatre and art and dedicate themselves completely to it despite finances.

First, quality and what art is good vs bad is completely subjective. I can just as easily make an unprovable statement and say all the education of the last 100 years has stifled art and the quality of art today is worse than it was however long ago. Theyre both silly remarks.

This was stronger in Estonia, which was independent from 1918 to 1940, than in Moldova, which was ruled by Romania or Russia for centuries. To judge by EKRE, though, that nationalism may not be entirely benign.

Hemp is great for inserts, but keep in mind it needs to be UNDER something like bamboo or cotton that absorbs quickly   hemp holds a ton, but is really slow when it comes to absorption.

It holds a lot of liquid and cleans fairly easily, but it doesn hold onto liquid the way any natural fiber does.

All the World's A StageIn May 1887 Thomas Russell Sullivan's highly influential stage adaptation of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde opened in Boston. British American actor Richard Mansfield had acquired the US stage adaptation rights and hired Sullivan to write the play in a way that would allow him to play both Jekyll and Hyde. This changed the plot considerably so that Dr Jekyll is younger than in the novel, has a wider social network and is engaged to be married. After enjoying considerable success in Boston and New York, on 4 August, 1888 the show came to London. Three days later, on 7 August, the first of the Jack the Ripper murders took place and some newspapers blamed the play, even hinting that Mansfield was the murderer, using his theatrical skill and knowledge of make up and costume to escape detection.

Mesquite and North Las Vegas would also be looking on.That's because such "cross gendered, outcall massage" is illegal in Las Vegas and elsewhere in the valley, in large part because Las Vegas Metro Police in the past have asked Las Vegas and Clark County officials to maintain strict controls. Metro vice detectives say that many outcall massage establishments operate as thinly veiled fronts for prostitution.The massage industry, however, is hailing the proposed law as a long overdue move that would help legitimize the profession and make it easier for customers to obtain therapeutic treatments.Boulder City has allowed cross gendered outcall massage from a storefront business since 1993.Henderson Police also defend the proposed ordinance, saying it increases the department's ability to monitor legitimate massage therapists while doing nothing to create loopholes for illegal activity."If someone is going to have an illegal activity, they're not going to get a business license through us," Henderson Police Capt.

He turned me to the side and half assedly draped my breasts, and then he massaged my intercostals and moved towards the lower back and the start of my butt crack.

The name Ernie Kovacs may not be widely recognizable, but his brand of television humor instantly is: Fake commercials, blackout gags, bogus talk shows and satire. Even when viewed through grainy black and white, the gonzo trail he blazed for "Laugh In," Monty Python, "Saturday Night Live" and Johnny Carson and all his wannabes   especially NBC era David Letterman   is plain to see. Born January 23, 1919, his death at age 42 preserved his largely unrealized genius in amber, leaving TV historians to gather the crumbs.

We have a teacher who cusses and is super chill most of the time, can ask him for any advice and not get judged. He's in high esteem from everyone and every student respects him. I think this is because there is a silver lining where he's stern when he needs to be and understanding when he doesn't. Plus there's serious commitment to the job and so much extra classes and study time he offers us. Genuinely an incredible teacher. Our class is graduating this year and we're thinking of how we can thank him at the moment.
You definitely can challenge a feeling. You can acknowledge the fear, and remind yourself that it's false. You can use knowledge to reduce fear, or various therapies to change how you feel. In difficult cases you can always go to therapy. For example I was terrified of spiders, like I would run screaming at the sight of one, and it's not am exaggeration. I ended up inna situation where spiders were unavoidable, and I know that knowledge typically reduces fear. So I spend a lot of time staring at photos of spiders and reading about them. I now let some live in my phone depending on the kind, and others I gently remove. With bigger fear based issues in my life, I've gone to therapy and done work using EMDR which is very helpful. As a kid, I was afraid of black people, but I kept telling myself "it's just a person." As an adult, the more exposed I was to different ethnicities and cultures the less afraid I was of people different than myself. I still find myself making unconscious biases time to time, but my fear of others different than myself has greatly reduced.

The study found that long term intake of CPP significantly suppressed visceral and liver fat accumulation that was induced by a high fat diet. CPP also helped the plasma glucose, insulin concentrations, and increased energy expenditure.Very interesting discoveries were made.

For the US universities, many schools offer financial assistance (without bonds), based on demonstrated need.

Rock paper scissors is a zero sum hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. Other names for the game in the English speaking world include roshambo, ick ack ock, ching chang walla [where?], and other orderings of the three items, sometimes with "rock" being called "stone".
