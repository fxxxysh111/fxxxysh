Each player must use exactly three cards from the five community cards and two from his/her hand in any combination to form a high hand and/or a low hand. The same five cards do not have to be used for the high and the low. Note that if there are not at least three community cards ranked eight or below, there will be no low hand, and the entire pot will be awarded to the best high hand. The two most important rules are: (1) Each player must use exactly three community cards and two hole cards; (2) the order of ranking for low hands is from the highest of the five cards.

Using Keepass with Dropbox on our iPhone, Android phone, tablets, Linux laptops and Windows desktops, always just worked. The downside? You had to alt tab to the app and copy and paste the password; however, many sites don use recognizable password fields, so you end up doing that with LastPass anyway. The worst thing about Keepass was the file wouldn necessarily get saved back to Dropbox properly, so we end up spawning copies of it and have to import them back into the original occasionally. But I see now that wasn that bad of a problem, and with a little more research and possibly a different Keepass client I bet that can be solved.

The charm in such games is that there is no perfect strategy, in the sense that there is no algorithm guaranteed to win in the long run against any other algorithm. The best poker players are able to use different algorithms against different opponents as the situation warrants.".

Bond checks, Japanese guy goes all in for $6 million, Black guy goes all in for $5 million, and there $35 million in the pot.LeChiffre raises to $12 million, making it $47 million in the pot.Bond goes all in for $40.5 million, making it $87.5 million in the pot. LeChiffre can either FOLD, and still have $27.5 million left against Bond $87.5 million; or he could CALL and WIN, but the game isn quite over since Bond still has some chips left; OR, LeChiffre could CALL and LOSE, meaning he pretty much is a dead man.The A 6 was just NOT strong enough for LeChiffre   a poker master   to risk his life on, especially since he still have $27.5 million left to go up against Bond $87.5 million. That seems like a huge disadvantage, but if LeChiffre simply wins ONE all in hand against Bond, then it would be roughly even (LeChiffre, $55 million, Bond, $60 million).LeChiffre should have known that once Bond moved all in, his A 6 would have been no good, and he should lived to see another hand (and day).Bottom line: Either LeChiffre should have folded, or they should have written it so that LeChiffre had A 8, giving him the best full house, and a hand beatable only by Bond crazy straight flush.

"Every home has its own signature scent," Brashear says, noting that air is a complex combination of all odor molecules, like laundry and hair care products, lotion, cooking smells, or pet odors, stinky shoes and other undesirable scents. She says that the odor cycle affects every home, since there's usually nowhere for those scent molecules to go, especially when the house is closed up during the cold and hot weather months. So, when scent molecules get released into the air they move throughout the home, then they settle into the couch, carpet, drapes, etc.

I had built up a decent bankroll from scratch in the first half of 2018 playing in my spare time so decided that the rest of my profits from that point on would go towards the ring. Shes in residency so i only get to play when she is on call and her call schedule for the next few months is pretty heavy. So my resolution is to hit the felt as much as I can while she is at work, win the last few thousand I need to get her the ring she deserves, and then pop the question in a few months.

You reading too much into the "disposable" part. It more accurately called discretionary income, meaning money left over after accounting for necessities. It still gets spent, though. The only truly excess money is what left over after you die. I wager there are more people in the world struggling to make ends meet at the end of their life than those with more money than they know what to do with.

Chandrian vs Amyr is a hypothetical on my part, mostly because black and white, nature and civilization, chandrian and amyr, namers and shapers, all sort of lead me to a yin and yang, eternal balance of the cosmos kinda thing. Also I re re re re re(or so) reading David Eddings lately, so I likely looking through his lens as well to a degree.

I did, because of both because of your repeated fighting with me about how you feel I should interpret the rules of this subreddit and because of the hateful remarks I was continually having to remove from this post. Shortly before my removal there was another discussion starting about vigilante justice and dragging people behind trucks to get justice for the dog. I didn feel like actively monitoring a single post for so much garbage anymore, which was the entire reason I removed your comment earlier. After years of moderating this community I know how simple it is to get people riled up and get them talking about garbage such as that. I knew where it was headed and tried to cut it off before if could go there by removing your comment. A conversation about finding the person responsible and paying to do so and another conversation about dragging the person deemed responsible behind a fucking truck in the same post are NOT something that I am willing to leave up on our subreddit.

Right now, the tech can't be hacked because it is all wired: the brain chip is connected by cable to a computer, the computer is offline (not on an Ethernet or WiFi network), and the decoded instructions for movement are transferred by USB to a muscle stimulator that is in direct contact with Ian's arm. We are working towards remote control of devices (car) for mobility, and that will require a secure, non hackable network. If brain activity were hacked, what the hacker would see is a large stream of numbers, ranging from  1000 to 1000 microvolts (though numbers can be larger with environmental noise).

I wonder if technology may provide an answer for these types of situations, for example, gaming communities tend to boast a huge variation of ages with little to no impact, mostly due to the anonymity you hold online, I would be very interested in seeing how online courses success vs age vs time taken would hold up.

Prior to the Real Media Real Change Cyberbullying Conference fiasco, one of the local Lords of Form approached Northern Star editor, David Kirkpatrick to see if the paper would run stories about Universal Medicine. Kirkpatrick was reluctant seeing the cult had threatened the paper with legal action for writing that Serge claims to be able to cure cancer, and the paper had erroneously printed that Benhayon and his sons practice Esoteric Breast Massage.

A protector is considered as a simple guard, a simple plastic covering for anything special. However, these protectors are sometimes extremely important if the insider product is vulnerable and exposed to higher damaging risks. For the poker players, the cards are definitely the most exclusive things. So the card covers are certainly going to be considered as exclusive as well. This was not a common scenario even a few years back. People used to have nothing to protect these vulnerable poker cards. Even if they unmindfully bended their cards, it would have been damaged. This was a pathetic thing for the renowned poker players. However, the scenario has changed a lot today as the players have become interested in using all kind of poker products that make their presences more obvious in the casinos around the world. No doubt, a Silver Bud Light Spinner Poker Card Protector is something that makes sure that you look elegant with your poker cards in hand.

I remember watching that episode and that mother was a nasty piece of work.

A moderately successful business can probably net somewhere north of 500k a year and even more. Many businesses have opportunities to expand and make more if you want to leverage your money and take on some risk. This is untrue for poker. In order to continue moving up, you can risk more money, but the win rate may not necessarily reflect your increased risk. The game gets tougher and tougher.

Gen X can't move forward the way boomers were able to, and since Gen X can't move forward, it's hard for millennials to even get in the fucking door. Gen X are okay, but millennials have no money.

On Monday, Jones County Sheriff's Department was dispatched to a residence just off of Highway 15 South, Laurel. Deputies had been advised that a victim had been assaulted. When the deputy arrived he met a male and female victim, residents of the home. The victims reported five people assaulted them after forcing their way into the home. The weapons used in the assault were a hammer, hatchet, fire poker, hoe and pistol. The female was held down while the male resident was able to somewhat defend himself, at which time the female resident had the opportunity to free herself. The suspects then fled the scene.

The myth that a low exchange rate encourages economic growth took hold in Canada in the 1990s. Canada manufacturing growth was led by low wage industries such as clothing, textiles and furniture, where employment rose 29.7% from 1992 to 2000. The flimsy basis for this allocation of resources was fully revealed, when a rising dollar and China exports devastated these industries. In retrospect, one can only look back with wonder and astonishment thatCanada acted as if our future lay in investing in low wage industries predicated on a chronically low exchange rate. dollars. It was a business model doomed to fail when the exchange rate started to appreciate.

It is abundantly absurd (if not thoroughly frightening) that Scalia and the Court in general responded favorably to the idea that the torture of animals is protected under first amendment rights. Not all images are actually free speech. We censor all sorts of erotic and even potentially erotic images of children and even teenagers. In part, because we as a society have deemed such speech "dangerous" because the images can condone and even incite sex with children and teenagers. In other words, it is not just the images, but that the images might constitute action that makes them illegal.

RDR2   for me it was like rockstar spent all this time making a great story and a detailed world, but it's like they forgot to make the actual gameplay fun and meaningful.

I love quality side activities in a game and RDR2 seriously lacked those for me.

Someone may have mentioned this (sorry; I haven't read the comments), but I HIGHLY recommend getting makeup/hair done professionally for special events!! I only do it rarely (big photos, awards ceremonies) and try to read lots of reviews first, go somewhere that the reviews say they'll listen well to what I want (what I want is always to learn basic tricks and get light makeup done, rather than go all out), ask LOTS of questions throughout the process, and resist their pressure to buy things as much as possible / get some of those things other, more affordable places! But it's invaluable. Looking like a million bucks once or twice kind of shows you that it's totally possible, and that you are, in fact, a million bucks..

All right. So you saying that gender roles for humans aren biological, and you also saying that trans people exist. What it comes down to, I think, is that simple biological statements that are true in 99% of cases are still 100% false when you don acknowledge the 1%. Rewording your statements to say "Only women can bear children" or "Only men can inseminate women naturally" is wrong if you accept that trans women are women and trans men are men. If you accept that, if you believe you should call trans people by the proper pronouns, if you think that for non medical purposes we should identify trans people as the gender they identify with, you will inevitably include people in the category of who have vaginas and ovaries and people in the category of who have penises and testicles. If you going to be inclusive in that regard, you might as well be willing to be accurate in your language to include the 2.1 million men and women for whom statements like have penises and have vaginas simply aren necessarily true.

Sort by centimorgans, closest cousins will be at the top. Those at the bottom who are "remote cousins" are very possibly just false positives and the shared DNA segments are coincidental (in the grand scheme of things the DNA of an Armenian person is not that different from an English person or an Indian person after all).

You also have the option in using a prepaid ATM. The difference with prepaid ATM is that players get to deposit their poker money to an ATM card and not just a Web site.

He left her or something like that.In the book she would compare cammille to her father a lot but never really spoke of himShe met Alan somewhere down the line or somehow I forgot.

Another weakness in the games of many beginning players is not folding after the flop when the only hope they have is a split pot or a runner runner (that is, needing the turn and river cards to win, which is a statistically weak position) to make their hand. In Omaha, after the flop, your hand is well defined. You see 7 out of the 9 cards you will use   almost 80 percent.

Call me a pervert, but I don think the issue here is what these men were doing poolside. Who cares if they did shots off each other nipples and anuses? And how the hell did perfectly "normal" homoerotic acts get labeled as "sexual deviancy"? Last I checked, homoeroticism is not listed in the DSM as a form of sexual deviancy, and even if it were, that only because psychiatrists are as uptight as priests when it comes to sexual pleasure (that why you still can masturbate onto a shoe without being labeled a deviant). As for whether these men were sexually harassed by their superiors, well, that sad, but I not really shedding tears over the fact that mercenary armies are not nice places to work.

I was in an online discussion once where a person adamantly refused to mark her out of office time on her calendar, and directed anyone who wanted to meet with her to email and ask for availability. Her rationale was that it was nobody business why she was out, which is true, but you don have to mark the time as "hemorrhoid treatment" or whatever, just put "out of office". Or set your Outlook to private, which shows the status of a time block (free, busy, out) but nothing else. Nope, she would not. Anyone wanting 30 minutes of her time had to petition her directly. Man, what an entitled ass she was.

Worst was easily Lil Yachty, not because he was bad, he did pretty great, but the crowd vibe was so shit, it seemed like the only reason anyone came was because he was a big name, not because anyone actually listened to his music.

For starters, it's important to accept that theNew York Timeshas always   or at least for many decades   been a far more editor driven, and self conscious, publication than many of those with which it competes.

I know Australia is far from perfect. I was just pointing out that I didn know a country like Ireland would have a legal system which takes the side of a rapist the way it did in this specific case. When I say "as an Australian" I simply wanted to show that an outsider doesn realise issues other countries face, especially in this kind of story. You don need to compare it with unrelated issues Australia is facing and personally attack me.

In the column from last March McGuirk stated that "There will be very few teams that have as much to spend in the marketplace next winter as the Atlanta Braves." Now if the offseason ended today it's hard to read that and not feel completely lied to by Terry McGuirk.

If you are summoned for a default hearing it will typically take 3 4 visits before the court determines you are suitable for jail time, sentences can last at a maximum of 6 months, and you will come out still owing the same amount. With respect to Dave Foley I think he had a bad legal team on his side, the courts do expect you to maintain the standard of living but it is also within your right to file a motion to change to adjust the amount owing based on your personal status (lack of income or work), it is a pain to complete all of this but I have seen people do it in order to drop the amount due every month..

If you suffer from red blotches on your face, you might be tempted to blame it on the elusive conditions of sensitive skin and cover up your skin's blotchy appearance with makeup, but do your skin a favor and hunt down the reason your skin is red to begin with..

This is a very important question you're asking because people get confused between two concepts. One is what normally called money management and one is what I would call "bankroll management". Bankroll management is very important. Even if you are a great player, you must have enough of a bankroll to sustain the inevitable losing streaks. And I have never been opposed to that. Quite the contrary, I have been very vociferous proponent of keeping a big enough bankroll to be able to play and sustain losses. The concept that I am always trying to explain to people is the "other" definition of money management.

Obama supported the no fly zone in Libya which led to the ouster and murder of Gaddafi, and the absolute disaster that country is in now. Libya isn even close to recovering from that.
