I was in middle school when I first got into doctor who and watched the first few series religiously, going back to classic who and buying all the novels and big finish and overpriced merchandise. I 25 now, though, and having a full time job / going through grad school kind of forced me to cool my passion. I caught all the Smith seasons and watched a few Capaldi episodes (I liked him a lot, too) but I never really got as much into it and only watched a few episodes from series 9 and 10. I think that puts me in a territory of "casual viewer"? Anyways, as a casual viewer, I loved series 11. I liked Moffat and his ultra complicated lore and even his obvious fanboyism showing through the episodes, but it kind of nice to just have an episode on and enjoy it rather than having to know all the backstory. All of the episodes from series 11 were standalones and while they kind of lack depth and character development I enjoyed the stories as themselves and appreciate that I can just turn it on even when I tired from work and have fun with pregnant dude in space or witch hunting with Allan Cummings even if I couldn catch last week episode or don know the series long arc. Series 11 definitely sparked my interest back and I really looking forward to more now.

If you have caught him chatting like that to other people then sit him down and explain to him that you feel that behaviour is not acceptable for a married man and that you would like for that kind of chatting to cease immediately as you feel it is a form of deception by him. If he does not agree to stop the chatting then he doesn't deserve your worry in the first place.

They wanted to switch from cane sugar to cheaper high fructose corn syrup, but they knew there would be a pr backlash when they made the switch. So they came out with "New Coke," let that abomination take the pr backlash, then brought back "Old Coke" except with the cheaper sweetener. 
These roads and bridges were just built, why waste more money on that? Etc." They (rightfully) saw their future incomes growing because they were the next generation who would step into power in their careers, and since their money making potential was already high, they voted en masse to protect their financial futures, by not taxing themselves..

 Older men may choose young women because both parties are less mature, and younger women won realize these men have ongoing maturity issues that aren being worked on or improved with age. Younger women are less likely to unfavorably compare older men to other people of the same age; they compare the man maturity levels with people their (the young woman own age instead. For example, compared to a bunch of teenagers or young kids in dorm rooms, this guy might look like he has his shit together with his own apartment and a job at the gas station, but compared to his peers who have $50k in savings and aren alcoholics, he definitely doesn have his shit together. 
Some may see it as a plus, I don know how I feel about it, but the incredulous look and responses that some of the guests give him during their interviews is something to behold. I think Letterman especially seemed like if it wasn for his Netflix contract he wouldn be there.

Mention of Mr Obama would often prompt an eye roll from an inhabitant of Hillaryland   a hermetically sealed bubble protected by the Secret Service and from which all naysayers were kept out. Like President George W Bush, Mrs Clinton put a premium on loyalty, which meant hard truths were seldom aired.

 3 points  submitted 8 days agoWatched a few good ones in my time. Favorite by far was the 2010 Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. Loads of action, politics and for the most part people morals are grey and not black versus white.On that vain I liked "the strategists alliance." I a lil biased because Sima Yi is my favorite character from ROTK but overall it been a good show so far.I occasionally get a chuckle out of "If you are the one."Watched a tv series years ago centered on Genghis Khan, thought that one was pretty good.Ming dynasty 1566 has been another show I been watching on and off.

To everyone reporting this thread: We have received around 13 separate reports for this thread calling it fake. I understand why it might seem fake, but after multiple moderator reviews we have determined that this story seems plausible.

Americans really don want to admit that we still participate in both the ideology of eugenics and the practice of it through medicine. The ideology of eugenics said traits such as intelligence or musical skills are inheritable as opposed to the result of upbringing. As we all know, Americans are hellbent on finding the supposed genetic cause for everything from homosexuality to shyness to athletic ability.

Re: third day onwards with fresh fruit/veg, I usually try to eat the most perishable stuff first (avocado, mozzarella, tomatoes, cucumbers) those will easily last two or even more days.

I love the library because its amazing to go and see so many books all in one place! I dont really care to read them digitally, and i grew up with such a limited selection of things to read. We just didnt buy books unless they were books my mom had already read and wanted to read again, which were mostly stephen king books. So going to the library was awesome because i could always find a bunch of books i wanted, and if i wasnt interested in it after all, it was simply a matter of taking it back and getting a better one. Now, you can actually request they buy what you looking for if they dont have it, and they usually do!
One crisis after another keeps cropping up. Those who failed him in their jobs sat next to him, equally perturbed. While Chaudhary Nisar kept shaking his right foot, which he always does whenever in stress, Nawaz Sharif kept taking notes on a paper slip.. 
Edit: The private sector picked up most of the slack of the declining government funding anyways. It hardly inhibited anything. If anything, this is allowing the government to spend money in other areas where the country needs it. You have to look at the entire picture.

And yet, there are undertones of male sexual violence throughout the movie and the book that young girls who read them are struck by. Is the book where Jacob forces a kiss on Bella, a scene inspiring tee shirts that say "I want to La Push Jacob off a Cliff." It is this book that divides young girls into Team Edward and Team Jacob. Is the opposite of Jacob.

The US Pakistan strategic dialogue is one of the most elaborate strategic communications campaign ever imposed on the mass media. The combined half a billion people   slightly more than 300 million Americans and slightly less than 200 million Pakistanis   that live in these two countries surely deserve better. What have the decent and hardworking people of these countries done to deserve these undulating waves of poker faced spin from their leaders? They have tolerated a public discourse that treats them like children. This is however, not the 1950s. It's the 21st century. Everybody knows the truth. Everybody, it seems, except the exaggerated simpletons that Hillary Clinton and Shah Mehmood Qureshi take their respective people to be. What a shame.

If there is a dude you want operating on your brain, its probably him. 
I about to be down voted into oblivion here but if it was me I would have moved out for that week. For me it would be a small sacrifice to make if it means my partner can maintain a good relationship with his family, especially after the risk of losing a loved one to illness. If he comes out to his parents the eventual fallout could scar him psychologically and damage your relationship more than if you had just visited a friend, and I personally would hate seeing my partner going through that kind of pain. 
With a keen eye, observe the level of cleanliness and hygiene: are the sheets clean? Is the floor polished? Are materials cluttered or well organized? How does the place smell like? You should also look at the massage therapist herself. Does she look presentable and hygienic?.

You are right. But I think it better to model it as AK losing half its combos due to the fact that half the time it would have randomly revealed a king, whereas AA will always reveal an A. It ends up with the same ratio of 8:6 = 4:3.
Predicting how a person will respond can be very useful, for instance when designing a strategy for negotiations.We investigate whether it is possible for machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize a person TMs intentions and predict their actions based on their visually expressive behaviour, where in this paper we focus on the face. We have chosen as our setting pairs of humans playing a simplified version of poker, where the players are behaving naturally and spontaneously, albeit mediated through a computer connection.In particular, we ask if we can automatically predict whether a player is going to fold or not.

I surprised Tucker Carlson didn even mention UBI, Which is probably a good thing. Explaining that would have taken quite awhile (Probably more time than the segment would allow) and might have completely turned off some people to Andrew Yang. You need to introduce people to the problem first, before providing the solution.Tucker Carlson and Andrew Yang actually have a lot of common ground on the upcoming automation crisis. 
Yeah, 5 years ago I was trying to buy a couple complete tool sets to get started and I reached out to Park to see if they had any discount programs for non profit bike shops. My response was literally, we don do anything like that So, I shot an email to Pedro and Jay Seiter immediately set me up with a VIP account. I didn even have a business license or proper name yet, but Jay was like, we can hook you up, no problem forward 5 years and I have bought 8(?) apprentice tool kits, 2 Master bench kits, 1 portable Master tool kit( I LOVE this one, even at $1000) and at least 25 floor pumps with god only knows how many pump heads. Between me personally and the shop, I would estimate that I have spent over $6000 with Pedro in the last 5 years.

Instead of making a big raise, say $50,000 from the button, I folded my hand. That's not how you win tournaments. Another time, I found myself making a big raise with pocket sixes when I was one off the button, and then calling when the 70,000 man, now in the small blind, moved all in with A 10.

"Possess human DNA": lots of bacteria do; bacteria swap DNA in and out of human cells all the time. In a later comment you added "a full human genome" which narrows things a bit, but still isn't well defined; it would exclude people with missing chromosome disorders (like Down's syndrome) which I'm sure you didn't mean.
The Fujifilm Instax Wide 300 is a big, bulky, and (in my opinion) ugly camera that is made of cheap plastic, but it is undeniably great at what it does. In my experience, the photos are well exposed and fairly sharp (compared to most Polaroid cameras), and it has the benefit of great Fujifilm Instax film.

Not what I meant at all. I mean that capitalism creates an atmosphere where the few put themselves above the many based on fictional currency.

Of course that what they saw during her shelter intake She was probably terrified! Bubs was on the euth list for having renal failure. We got his bloodwork redone. He just had a UTI (but showed as kidney failure due to stress). The other pup that was brought in with him was on the euth list for having cancer. She was pulled by a local rescue that I volunteer with and she had a mass that was removed, which was not cancerous.

I'll let you in on a secret. The second amendment is dead if we can't move it out of the partisan sphere of politics. If our plan for keeping our rights is to ensure no progressives or liberals (like myself) ever hold power, then we will lose them. Gun rights cannot continue to be tied to social and economic conservatives only if they are to survive. As such, rhetoric such as yours does nothing but harm the long term prospects for our right to individual self defense.

Through an agreement between my school and the community college, I began taking true college classes at 14, not dual credit!

According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently "humanized" and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. For example, attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.[165] In contrast to social democracy, democratic socialists advocate a post capitalist economic system based on either market socialism combined with workers self management or on some form of participatory economic planning.[166] 1 point  submitted 9 hours agoYeah just stay on the outside of the line.

A single person claimed this, not a bunch. Also, the person claiming it was dismissed halfway through the war for disagreements with the nazi leadership. Not exactly the most reliable source, especially since there is no other evidence that the nazis planned the fire. It certainly sounds like something they'd do, but you won't find many historical documents supporting it. Even Gring himself said he was full of shit, since they could've oppressed the communists with or without the fire. Which is definitely true, since by that point the party was almost completely outlawed.
Ring said the rape has had a "humongous impact on her life." While she's relieved to have reported it to police, she is also "extremely scared," he said.

Recent years, numerous medical studies have confirmed the essential role of manipulation and motion in the maintenance of disc health, joint lubrication (synovial fluid), and articular cartilage nutrition. Increasingly, researchers have concluded: that impaired joint mobility, which alters the joint lubrication mechanism, may be the principal mechanism in spinal degeneration. The joints of the body are avascular (no blood supply) which leaves them dependent on movement.

First and foremost, getting one doctorate is a torturous process that involves a huge amount of work and sacrifice (as do many careers), but the decade or so a person spends on their doctorate does not necessarily produce a job or even marketable job skills at the other end. US university system overproduces PHDs and underproduces tenure track jobs. Other words, there a surplus of labor, about half of whom will find tenure lines and the others will labor away as underpaid and uninsured adjunct professors or be forced to go out into the "real world" where their doctorates will probably be useless..

We would not be able to properly understand the struggles in the Middle East and the Muslim world at large if we don delve into the colonial conquests into the region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Britain, France, Russia, and to a lesser extent, Italy, all invaded Middle Eastern, North African and South Asian regions that were majority Muslim. Britain held Egypt and India, France held Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, Russia went into the Caucasus and Iran, and Italy held Libya. As is the case with most imperial conquests, the invaders declared themselves superior and subjugated the native populations. There was a clear line between Christian invaders and Muslim subjects, and as you may imagine, things didn go well. For example, British officer Frederick Cooper, Deputy Commissioner of Armitsar, reported in 1857 about quieting an uprising in Lahore, India by Sepoys (Bengali soldiers in what is now modern day Pakistan):

I don think the comparison to English works great here and not even because of English lack of grammatical gender   the Anglophone approach to gendered language has been very different than the approach I seen here in Germany.

Due to the vagaries of tournament poker, in a typical field even the very best players are only about three to four times as likely to win as the average player. In other words, in any given tournament with 400 entrants, the top player in the field would be no better than a 100 1 shot to win it. The odds structure is even tighter in a special case such as the big HORSE event, which is the most expensive of the 57 tournaments at the World Series of Poker and carries the richest entry fee for any poker tournament in North America.

It seems to have a bit forward and backwards for Molino.

That a much more nuanced argument since soy and other plant based protein sources, contrary to popular vegan belief, are not "complete sources of protein" (meat is), as they lack two of the nine amino acids, specifically methionine and lysine. So soy alone would not suffice, and more sources of plant protein would need to be consumed to make up for the lack of amino acids one finds in protein rich meat. This goes without saying that it takes approximately 150g of soy to get the same amount of protein (20g) as 80 90g of meat. The average person needs approximately 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight, which is estimated to be 46g per day for women and 56g per day for men on average, so for the sake of math we say each human needs, at minimum, 50g of protein/day. 50g of protein means that each person would be eating (if we are talking soy alone and ignoring amino acid deficiencies) 375g of soy per day to get their recommended protein intake.

 56 points  submitted 9 days agoGenestealer talons are hardly regular. On the TT they have the same AP modifier as chainaxes, and are often described as warp powered bullshit explicitly because they can kill Terminators. They are at the VERY least adamantium laced and monomolecular, being swung by something at least as strong and much faster than a space marine. They arent cutting plates, but they can very effectively attack joints and the squishy bits underneath.From a medical perspective, every single one of those things has to be rebuilt virtually from the ground up in order to create a space marine. The latter of which by design.Their proportions are so radically different that of a human that there isn a single bone that wouldn need to be changed in shape, size, and density from the original, and you better believe that the hormonal changes needed to introduce entirely new organs into their physiology are literally entire orders of magnitude larger than the difference between human males and females.

When my children ask me how someone as smart and as good as Obama could be doing these things, I answer that he is not in charge. Politicians exist to get re elected and getting re elected requires contributions from big business and big military. Obama and the US Congress don really represent the American people as much as the America corporation. Getting a decent human being into the presidency is not enough. We must reform campaign finance laws in order to effect real change.

To win the pot. I must Disagree, If you picked 100 poker players at random and asked them about the objective of poker, most would say something about winning the pot, but they couldn't be further from the truth. If your objective of poker was to win the most pots, that would be easy to do. Just play every hand and every bet and raise until the bitter end. You'd win a lot of pots. In fact, you'd win every pot you possibly could. But you'd lose money. Plenty of it, and rapidly. (Full Answer)

No one in their right mind, who has sold a company worth a hundred million (even above 7 million) will be using turbotax if the sale is through legal and legitimate, meaning that you are paying the necessary taxes and have the necessary documents. They would be losing out on millions of dollars worth of incentives and bonuses for themselves. So either you spewing nonsense, or these people who have hundreds of millions of dollars but use turbotax did not attain their money legally..

Das Kapitel zeigt wie man diesen Stil wirklich richtig anwendet. Zwar muss ich noch das ein oder andere mal drber lesen, aber ich bin mir sicher das richtige Werkzeug in die Hand bekommen zu haben.

More than ever, today's travelers are keen to set out solo   whether due to competing work schedules, changing demographics, or a basic hankering for personal freedom   only to find themselves dinged with an expensive single supplement fee for the so called privilege.

So if you're itching for some alone time on your next vacation, you can now pick from beach vacations, spa getaways, culturally enriched itineraries in far off destinations, and even activity themed trips (think skiing, diving, golfing). Then, get out there and reap the benefits of your vacation for one.

Dealer Position   This position, also referred to as "on the button", is the most coveted because once the flop takes place, the dealer is the last to act. This means you can watch and gather information on all the other players before making your decision. Aggressive play is expected from this position, especially when all others have checked. Almost any hand except trash hands like 9 2, 10 4 offsuit can be considered for play here.

But we never really allow space for the stories of Palestinians seeking safety and sanctuary to be uplifted.

Meanwhile, back on the post gender campuses that I inhabit, sexual assault is a constant threat and is nearly always committed by a particular gendered and sexed body and most of the time on a differently gendered and sexed body.

It is unknown what this depicts specifically but in general it sends an image of exhaustion and wear. The caption for the image says that it shows "the condition of the Hun troops" and that the subject "Herr Professor" is learning "a good many things not hitheroto found in books". Maybe he was a teacher, maybe not. Macht nichts. His pants looks velour like and his boots (if that what his footwear was) look very thin. He is ragged, his double fold glasses look like they at their limit, his face looks swollen behind his beard, and he just looks "done", in general. He may be trying to figure out local currency to purchase whatever it is the vendor woman has on the tray at her hip she os holding out her hand, and looking at his. The soldier definitely has something there, and he looks basically too weary to comprehend it. the hand language is ambiguous to me. He may have received something already, some sort of food, and he is staring at it now, thinking perhaps how little of it there was. He eating, and already has taken a bite of whatever bread like thing is in his left hand. I not sure what attracted the attention of the boy in the center perhaps it is simply the camera, and he wanted to be in the shot. a shadow in the foreground left of what looks like someone making a photograph of the scene probably not our photographer, but another, with a brownie or some such smaller camera.
They were all there to have a good time though, so it was a very friendly situation  even with me half sauced and needling the horrible player the whole time as I was repeatedly taking pots off him  saying shit like, "are you sure you're gonna have enough money to get back home?"In between the needling, I had been discussing with my friends the likely expensive wedding plans my soon to be wife was coming up with.So, finally, the Scandinavians decide to take off.

I think they were wrong in what they did especially considering they pretty much squandered all of the money he made, but there was no idea then that children had a right to any money they earned until after child labor was strictly regulated and the law that bears his name was enacted.

They're so scared of being held accountable for having totally fucked the country for their own benefit over the last 40 years. They never admit it though, it's always, "you just don't have the necessary life experience to understand that you being financially stable is not helpful to us, so go fuck yourself."

"We don't exclude common phrases and clich expressions from the algorithm," a representative from Turnitin explains to me about the process. "We check student work against our database, and if there are instances where student writing is similar to, or matches against, one of our sources, we will flag this for an instructor to review. Ultimately, human judgement is required to make a determination about plagiarism, and it's likely that, if a commonly used phrase is flagged, an instructor would make the distinction."
