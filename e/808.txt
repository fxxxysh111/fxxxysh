Why is everybody stunned by political corruption. This has always happened, and it will always continue to happen. Right and left are the same. It called divide and conquer. Stir up the left with lies, then stir up the right with lies. The people argue and don notice the theft that happening. It is human nature to behave this way. If I were somehow elected to office, I would also behave this way. So would all people. The intention may not be there when the first get into politics, but eventually reality sets in and you become one of them.

In 2014, when Vishal Sikka took over as chief executive officer of Infosys, India's second largest information technology services firm with annual revenues of $10 billion, the company was grappling with challenges on many fronts. Artificial intelligence and automation were edging out IT outsourcing models, putting pressure on the entire industry. Internally, Sikka discovered that while Infosys scored high on quality, professionalism and delivery excellence, clients did not perceive it as being proactive and innovative, and it lacked strategic relevance..

Salvaging your relationship is 1 so if your husband cannot understand why you feel this way (I believe your emotions are completely valid, even without "proof" that they are more than friends) you really have to evaluate the future of your relationship. 
Decades higher education provided a way for Americans to do that.

In a strict lore sense, Kul Tiras is simply one of the seven human kingdoms (plus the now defunct city state of Theramore) that make up the remnants of the Empire of Arathor and represent the majority of human civilizations on Azeroth. Regular (vanilla) humans canonically represent the Kingdom of Stormwind, but people have been playing them as Lordaeronians and Dalaranians and so forth since forever, so I don see any problem with using a Kul Tiran body model to stand in for a bulkier citizen of one of the other kingdoms.

Pragmatically, you still need both. The ratio of duration to effort, even assuming a very stable team, isn simple or linear. Further, the "very stable team" assumption is rarely satisfied in practice. It isn clear what the "velocity" estimation is. But this begs the question: why do you need to know duration? Is it for sprint planning? Then you don need duration, you need effort because you can derive velocity from effort and sprint work is measured in terms of velocity (points per sprint). Is it for release planning? Then you can derive duration from velocity; the release will take (Total Points / Velocity) sprints times the length of a sprint (+/  for the Cone of Uncertainty that will narrow as you progress).
Every time I go to Lembongan (not all that often) I see at least one person who has had a bad spill on a scooter. The results I seen ranged anywhere from lots of cuts and a very bad case of road rash to being medevaced to Bali (and then on to Singapore, I think). People think that scooters there are no big deal because there is almost no car traffic. But between the road conditions (potholes, gravel, sharp turns and steep inclines) and the inexperience, it can be quite dangerous. All that to say PLEASE be extra careful on a bike.

Some may wonder why the possibility of a straight with a heart flush isn't an automatic call on the flop. While it's true that the possibility of two hearts hitting the turn and river (often called runner runner) improve your odds slightly, the odds are knocked back down by the fact that if you hit a flush, it may not be the best flush because the A is out and may be in an opponent's hand; or if you improve to two pair, you could be beat by trips. Remember, don't ever let the possibility of runner runner enter into your calculations until the first runner hits. When you need two cards to make a hand (often called a two outer), you are getting terrible odds.
The whole concept of "is this neighborhood safe" can be insulting to people who live here so I'd steer clear of wording it like that. I've lived in neighborhoods all over manhattan (East and West Harlem, Inwood, Washington heights, upper west side) and in crown heights in BK. 
Often in math, teachers explain how to do something, but not why it is done that way. 
A greater concern from my POV is Hillary tendency to send in the military as the first option. She was in favor of the Iraq war, and stayed in favor of the Iraq war well into her stint as Secretary of State, long after most others had realized it was a mistake. She pushed to destabilize Syria, and look where that got us. There are several other examples too.
It widely rumored that I hate the dog, and it kind of fun to perpetuate the myth. The truth is, I have nothing against Moose. The only difficulty I have is when people start believing he an actor. Acting to me is a craft, not a reflex. It takes years to master, and though it does have its rewards, the reward I seek is not a hot dog. Moose does tricks; I memorize lines, say words, even walk around and stuff. But I don need a trainer standing off camera, gesticulating wildly and waving around a piece of meat, to know where I supposed to look. Maybe instead of just slowly panning the camera to the window, cut to some gameplay or something that gives the viewer an idea of what playing the game will involve. And for a transition, instead of just a boring cut straight to black, maybe you could have a lightning strike knock the power out, giving you a good chance to cut?

I went from an inconsistent 10 pull ups to 20 every time in less than a month doing a modified pyramid. Since my max was 10, I did something like 4 6 8 8 6 (which changed as my max increased rapidly every week). This was 12 years ago and my Sergeant had a spreadsheet he printed out for us. Either way, there are many pyramids out there. The key is muscle memory. Even as my fitness declined in later years, I was nailing those push ups just fine. Maybe did a few 10 rep sets in the weeks preceding my test, but nothing crazy.

There are always a million reasons a candidate loses, especially when the race is close, but you cannot possibly deny that attacks from the left hurt Hillary.

We have to remember that "popular" is all relative. In the age of the internet every opinion and viewpoint is "popular," because everyone who holds it can jump onto Twitter and mouth off about it. The online reaction to said opinion is appropriately outsized, which makes people think that the issue is even larger than it really is (reading Reddit, you might think that Flat Earthers are legion, when they are obviously not). But the truth is that SJW esque viewpoints are definitionally fringe. They espoused by radicals to bring attention to an issue.

Having a good feel for your table's momentum or dynamics can help you combat an endless run of lousy cards. Taking down incidental, non contested pots is the key to survival and tournament advances. But that requires intuitive information. If you use Hold'em Pirate like I do, the VPIP meter is invaluable in that regard. At a glance you know how your "collective table" is acting and how that is affecting the contested pots. So if you are not in position, or not getting pot odds, you are better off staying out of the action with a high VPIP table rating. On the other hand, a low (tight) VPIP rating with offer up ample opportunity to take down a lot of small pots while building an aggressive image for yourself.

The heat from the stones helps your muscles relax, allowing the massage therapist to manipulate your deep tissues more effectively. Overly tense muscles can hinder the massage procedure, so if your muscles are extremely tight or stiff, the heated stones may provide the extra relaxation you need for the massage to be beneficial in releasing tension and easing sore muscles. While all types of massage can help relieve pain caused by tense muscles, stiff joints or injuries, a hot stone massage may provide greater relief due to the intense nature of the massage.

A BMW, at the cost of real connections to family and friends and community, is a poor substitute for real connection.

Did Sora end up saving Kairi at the end? I mean, she appears in the final scene and Namin was able to come back (I don't remember them saying it explicitly but I think in order for Roxas to come back they needed Sora alive so I'm guessing Namin was the same since she's Kairi's Nobody?

At the end of your present reply you seem to be focusing on the idea of paranoia and how it has resulted in a disunity in the US, a disunity which you appeared to argue in your original comment does not exist in more populous nations. But earlier in your present reply you outline some causes of disunity in modern India, seemingly undercutting what appeared to be your original argument. Ultimately, is the position reducible to some version of the statement "populous nations can have fucked up internal dynamics for myriad reasons"? That I can do agree with, even as I remain unconvinced of the lack of domestic unrest in other large nations.

Q: My 12 year old son has a newspaper route but he seldom glances into the papers he delivers. This week however, he hesitantly announced that he dropped a bundle of papers and the first flyer that fell out was a back to school flyer! He was all excited to share his wish list with me, but the panic I felt must have shown on my face; he's a bit too young to really understand how stressful added expenses can be. I'm a single mom with 2 kids and even though they'll both be in high school this year, this back to school time always seems to be a big expense.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the opera librettist Apostolo Zenoand his indebtedness to the tre corone of Italian literature, Dante,Petrarch, and Boccaccio. While Zeno has been studied primarily in hisfunction as opera reformer and as the operatic predecessor of PietroMetastasio, his theoretical and practical investment in Italian literaryculture and more specifically how his investment in Italian literaryculture fed the aesthetics of his eighteenth century librettoZeno's investment in the tre corone, focusing primarily on two ofhis libretti: La Griselda (1701) and Scipione nelle Spagne (1710).Zeno's La Griselda evidences a metamorphosis of Boccaccio andPetrarch's patient Griselda character into a constant heroine fitfor the eighteenth century stage; Scipione nelle Spagne engages withDante's depiction of Cato at the base of Purgatorio, transformingDante's figuration of a Stoic hero into an ethos ofApostolo Zeno stands today as a poster boy of eighteenth centuryopera reform, as a precursor to Pietro Metastasio and his heroic dramas,and as a figurehead of the proverbial literary buon gusto that wasespoused by the widespread and widely spreading Arcadian Academy.

Bingo is a simple game that is popular throughout the world. It is a derivative of the lotto and is easy to learn and play. The mechanics of the game are simple. A caller or random number generator randomly selects a number that is announced to the players. The players then mark the number where ever it appears on their cards. This process is repeated until a player completed the announced pattern and wins the game. It couldn't be simpler to learn and play since there are no complicated rules of playing strategies that can be used. The game is a game of luck and chance. The player who wins does so because of luck, not because of skill.

To end my 4am missive here, we are currently training some amazing new mods. They are going to make mistakes. It's part of the learning process. I remember many mistakes I made back then. I still accidentally stick my foot in it sometimes! When your comments are removed they are not deleted. They are still visible to just yourself and the mods of the sub they came from. If, like I mentioned above you have a carefully thought out comment that has been removed, chances are that there's something in there that if you try modmailing us first, and if that's not going through for you (trust me, I feel your frustration there) if you politely reply to the removal comment asking if there's something you could edit, we'd generally be happy to work with you.

Well, hell yeah. Imagine if we could kill the homos here? We have so much more time to focus on hetero marriage and getting rid of not just abortion, but birth control too. Damned homos are messing up the mission of the far right in the US and unlike many African countries, they cannot say that homosexuality is a foreign invasion. Or maybe they could. Sure, why not? Homosexuality would go away if we just successfully shut down the border with Mexico and Canada, because they so gay.

I used WD 40 in a pinch to clean contacts that way but the lighter fluid worked better.

I have to admit that I still skeptical about what you posted from Dr. Fong. He talks about "low gravity" but how low is low?

In my post religion adult life, watching TNG twice in the past year has convinced me (at least for now) that Rodenberry vision of a society without want or need is the closest approximation to what I could say i believe in, even to a religious stand point.

I mean, you can see the barbarian pivot his rear foot while turning his hips in order to attack with a two handed weapon! Stiff animations, like when the character strikes with the arms while his lower body is completely disconnected from the movement and doing something else is the reason I can get into games like PoE. But this polished gameplay felt "wasted" on the D3 poor initial content, mainly the campaign and the endgame loop before loot 2.0.

My experience has been the opposite. With UPS or Fedex I have had two times where there was some attempted theft ( one was around Christmas, and the product kept saying it was going to be delivered but never was. ) So I went out to meet the FedEx driver when he was going to deliver an unrelated package to me, I told him you should have something else for me, he goes and jumps in the back of his truck and pulls out my package with the entire label attempted to be scrapped off.
To make things worse, the worker/patient perspective on these painful problems can sometimes seem inconsistent from the vantage point of an employer observer and even a health care provider caring for the problems.

On a flop of AKQ, this will smash his 3 betting range, he will have sets and two pairs so often here. Despite this range advantage, the opponent raises this flop basically representing QQ or JT and maybe AK as value, and combo diamonds (most likely Adxd for) for semibluffs. Raising a hand like AQ on the flop from the opponent would be considered a pretty big overplay given charlie range and charlie hand almost feels fairly face up as very strong. Charlie must have exploitatively put his opponent on just QQ here or JT and hence why he was rooting for an A (K would do as well) as he expected his opponent is value heavy (QQ, JT) and he is drawing to 4 outs. Another consideration is that the hand started over 200 big blinds deep so it is a reasonable assumption that people don get too out of line with bluffs here in this spot this deep.
And the Handlers thought, "Gee, wouldn this little masturbatory aid make a great toy for girls? And let name it after our daughter, Barbara."

Complaint: Somehow, at some point in time after the race filled up, literally 3 other women ended up with UltraSignup predicted finish times that are identical to mine and so somehow all 4 of us are expected to win this race?

Nor is it clear that other police forces across the country, or in Southwestern Ontario, are likely to follow London lead.Megan Walker, executive director of the London Abused Women Centre (LAWC), had lobbied police for more than a decade to publicly release the names of accused johns, something only handful of Canadian police forces do.Police long countered they withhold those names even in human trafficking investigations because, in the end, most such suspects avoid a criminal record by attending a diversion program to educate them about the pitfalls of the sex trade industry.After Walker says police denied her freedom of information request for the names of the men charged in Project Circuit, a six week human trafficking sting that led to charges against 25 johns in the fall, she decided to take matters into her own hands.felt the only way we could determine what kinds of men are purchasing sexual services was to go and look at the court dockets every day, Walker said.Fabienne Haller, who also works at Walker organization, was tasked with swinging by the London courthouse every morning to check the dockets.

Theater stages stayed this way until the mid late 19th C. and the advent of realism. Raked stages were great for letting a flat audience see the whole stage but the required strange movements to avoid the appearance of limping or stumbling. It was also at this time that more "modern" theatres were being built with the terraced audience seating that we are used to.
Edit to add: oh by the way, given the accumulated scores after the DD, had Alex wagered 10 his team would still have been alive given an incorrect answer, and still would have locked given a correct answer. The post DD accumulated scores were not any sort of outlier in the distribution of post DD accumulated scores; most distributions of post dd scores will be this way. That very simplistic, but it a pretty easy illustration of why I think I right.
A person can be flawed and still do good things. 
How is that irrelevant? Representation and citizenship are literally the crux of the issue. The territories are not part of Israel, both by Israeli and Palestinian desires, and will hopefully one day be part of an independent Palestinian state. Why should separatist areas have voting rights when they are not citizens of Israel, nor do they want to be? Israelis didn vote in the Gazan elections, should Gazans vote in the Israeli elections? Israeli Arabs have the same rights as everyone else. They can vote, serve in the Knesset, own land, hell they can serve in the IDF if they want to.

Know yourself. The French theologian Pierre Charron once famously said, "the easiest way to be cheated is to believe yourself to be more cunning than others."[3] A cunning person should certainly be able to find others' strengths and weakness, but it's almost as important that she also be able to find her own. Give yourself a brutally frank evaluation.

To understand why greenhouse gases are harder to fix, and you need at least double the yearly energy expenditure to go neutral, understand that 80% of the world energy comes from fossil fuels. Produces 50 pounds of CO2 for every one pound of trash generated. CO2 is a heavy molecule with extra oxygen atoms for every carbon in the original carbon chain and it is relatively diffuse, so it is hard to capture and move.

I look at most media as PR firms for special interests and they are not mine. A journalist who wants to do a story on pesticides, drugs/prices, bank transgressions, Gov reps scandals, etc will need to do so outside of the "most trusted names in news". It would be like doing a bad press release against the company that hired you. A broken system for the masses and a go to tool for the string pullers. The attacks are seemingly only directed at those who oppose the machine that runs the narrative.

There was a huge struggle between my dad and the attackers. There were fists thrown, a shovel swinged and a fuckton of shouting.
