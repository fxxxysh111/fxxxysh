Yep I feel this a lot. I a female developer so I in a male dominated industry but even so I find it hard in comparison to my male colleagues because I constantly second guess myself, don have the confidence to stand up for my opinions etc. Now is this a female issue? It hard to tell but when I talk to other female devs at work they all say they felt the same. My boyfriend works for a different company in a similar role and said he never felt like that. I think when you the "other" in an industry (I imagine it works the same for men in female dominated industries) you feel like you pushing extra hard to not only represent yourself but your entire gender. If I make a stupid mistake that gets cast across "all female developers" and that makes me wary (let not mention things like men getting disciplined less harshly and being seen as confident go getting leaders in comparison to all the negative traits that get applied to women. "Bossy" being a feminine term).

Working a sub contract should absolutely not have an impact on your salary as an engineer. There is some pass through fee that goes to the prime, but that should bear on the amount of profit and the amount of work billed to the subcontractor, and not on the salary of the engineers doing the work. If you work for a company where you have a lower hourly rate while working a sub contract than you do on a prime contract, you should leave that company.

Now Howard Dean is appearing on Fox "News" agreeing with Palin that the war in Afghanistan must be pursued? Oddly enough, he even argued (like Dubya) that the US is pursuing the war to "liberate" women. Huh?

Can you imagine a bunch of neocons and Howard Dean sitting around a table saying "US foreign policy should be motivated by the feminist goals of women liberation from patriarchy"? That about as believable as Sarah Palin being an expert on foreign policy.

I love sex though. I always down to fuck really; anywhere, anyway, anytime, always. And when my bf doesn want to have sex I almost beg to blow him his load out. He rejects those approaches too most of the time. He works and is just too tired sometimes and just wants to sleep so, I can understand where he coming from. But it makes me feel bad. I feel like I have failed him in some way. I know it not true but at the same time I unsure with my way of thinking.

Oui, on prtend donner le  bon exemple  aux autres ! Il faut aussi rappeler que le CO2 que nous expirons, cela fait tout de mme partie de la vie, pour tous les animaux et tous les tres humains.

"Just Another Train Song" is not as ordinary as it sounds, since it is about someone almost killed by a train.

I think Warby Parker has shown that any equilibrium in the market for a high priced, high margin product is going to be inherently unstable.

Non opioid analgesics, like aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve), act at the site of pain. The damaged tissue releases enzymes that stimulate local pain receptors. Non opioid analgesics interfere with the enzymes and reduce inflammation and pain. They inhibit ascending pathways of pain perception and activate descending pathways. Opioid analgesics are used for higher levels of pain relief   they include morphine, meripidine (Demerol), propoxyphene (Darvon), fentanyl, oxycodone (OxyContin) and codeine. These compounds are useful in treating neuropathic pain (chronic pain that comes from injury to the central nervous system). They include the following:Anti epileptic drugs reduce membrane excitability and action potential conduction in neurons of the central nervous system. Tricyclic antidepressants affect synaptic transmission of serotonin and norepinephrine neurons in the central nervous system, thereby affecting pain modulating pathways. Anesthetics block action potential transmission by interfering with sodium and potassium channels in nerve cell membranes. Examples include lidocaine, novocaine and benzocaine. They include relaxation techniques, hypnosis, biofeedback and distraction techniques.

I never stopped training altogether, but there were a couple years where my was sporadic at best and multiple periods in there where I missed a month or two completely. Once I got back to seriously training most of my strength came back within a couple months and I was matching or beating my old numbers within 6 months.

To appeal to their sensibilities and their empathy and make them start to think about how it feels for us not to be included. And hopefully, get them to tell the other people in their groups about our concerns and convince them as well, so that eventually even though we as the people affected are the people are still the minority, the people who care about letting us stay are the majority and we do get the collective power to make sure that we get to enjoy the comedy space as well.That why it valuable to be like Nick in this situation (though I would have been more forceful) and point out when people are making jokes about experiences they have no idea about and are liable to push away those who have lived through those experiences.

I realize I used an anecdote to make a point. Not the best way to do that. But, I mean, everyone loves until they find a reason to stop. Animals don go "Oh you know what, I hate the way he cleans pans and doesn contribute to chores, ugh." I think it far more about violating their trust that makes them stop loving you. And I think that takes a lot more effort to make happen than a human falling out of love with you. Cats, I think, are a lot harder to earn their love. It easy to love them but violate their boundaries, unlike dogs. Dogs just don have a lot of boundaries. But if you loved someone to pieces and they just disappeared one day, you still love them even a long time later. If you saw them again after several years, you still be so happy to see them because nothing happened to change how you feel about them. (Though we can realize that them disappearing may mean that they don love us or disrespect our friendship, so then we get mad and move on)

I think calling this flop is fine and reevaluating on the turn OR check/jamming, especially with Kd. You can get a lot of worse hands to call (1010, JJ, QQ, other draws).

Jamming here makes it look like you chasing the flush draw and you could get some snap calls from JJ and QQ.

Speaking of the offers he's hearing about in other buildings, Kaufman says: "We're able to get a high floor for the same price as a lower floor. Landlords are saying, 'We will literally build the space for you.' And these are Class A buildings."

Cricket can scarcely hope again to witness two styles as fascinatingly contrasted and as racially representative as Fry's and Ranjitsinhji's. Between them they evolved a doctrine that caused a fundamental change in the tactics of batsmanship. Play back or drive. Watch the ball well, then make a stroke at the ball itself and not at a point in space where you hope the ball will presently be. At the time that Fry was making a name in cricket most batsmen played forward almost automatically on good fast pitches, frequently lunging out at full stretch. If a ball can be reached only by excessive elongation of arms and body, obviously the pitch of it has been badly gauged. Fry and Ranjitsinhji, following after Arthur Shrewsbury, developed mobile footwork.
I also think you made some good points regarding shallow reference pools and recency bias in evaluation; the number of people who talk about anime as if it the greatest thing that exists or otherwise grossly overestimate its prominence (including one poster here a couple of years ago who stated that Evangelion should be a mandatory part of the undergrad psych curriculum) will never cease to bother me.. 
A bit disappointed in Greg return. I liked the picture Marco painted   really happy at Emory, madly in love.

Every online free casino tournament declares various categories of prizes for their players like the most active player, or the player to put the most stakes and so on. In most of the casino tournaments there is a not registration fee and the entry for the tournament is totally free. But there are certain tournaments where the prize is very high and people need to pay a certain amount of cash before actually registering themselves for the casino tournaments. This is the reason, only professional players play these tournaments and most people like to take part in a free casino tournament.

I seriously looked into this in college, it isn as easy as it sounds. First off they judge you like you wouldn believe on health, family history, appearance, grades and standardized test scores, etc. the higher you score combined in all the categories the more they will offer for your eggs, if they want them at all after evaluating you thoroughly.

A short article (with a smaller photo illustration) on a very big topic appeared in Illustrated World in June 1921. The photo showed a remarkable plane constructed by aeronautical engineer Giovanni Caproni (1886 1957) three planes, really. Three triplanes were attached to a floating Pullman like fuselage, making this the largest/heaviest aircraft ever built at that time. It was 32 high, 66 long, and 130 wide, and was made to seat 100 and make a transatlantic voyage. This was the "Noviplano" (the Caproni Ca. 6c, and translated in the article as "Nine plannen"), and presented itself in an impressive if not complicated manner it was a prototype, though, and was crashed and finished on its second flight.

Ok maybe i just missing something here but everytime I see someone say more and better rewards, it sounds like they just giving me more of my money back. And any volume based rewards system has a consequence of penalizing players that don play as much aka recs aka the people we should be rewarding not penalizing. So why wouldn they just have even lower (already lower) rake? Because humans respond well to incentives and its a way to drive more traffic.

What the difference is between traditional specs and Agile "user stories";
If we are to tell a story about the origin of commercial gambling, the history of poker would go side by side, as the two cannot be separated. Dated back to early 19th century, poker is probably a card game with the highest number of variants, the most popular and widely spread being Texas Hold'em. Originating in Texas, Hold'em poker did not cross the state border until the late 60s, when three Texan gamblers brought the game to the Mecca of USA gambling   Las Vegas. At first, the game did not really kick off and for quite a while it was only offered in the famous Downtown Las Vegas casino, Golden Nugget. The reputation of the casino back then did not help with promoting Texas Hold'em to high rolling players and it was not until the game was played at the Dunes casino that Hold'em started to attract high end players.

Its pathetic how westerners, presumably males, who probably never seriously gave 2 shits about feminism or womens rights suddenly get defensive when it comes to "ownership" of feminism, and talk over ACTUAL female feminist scholars in claiming who it revolves around.

Early Position   This is made up of positions 1, 2 and 3 to the left of the dealer and are the least advantageous as you are the first to act after the flop and have no information on the other players. Here one should play only the strongest hands like paired A's, K's, Q's, J's, Tens, or suited AK, AQ, AJ and KQ. Anything outside of these one should consider folding and waiting for a better opportunity, especially with an aggressive table. One thing that can be done from an early position is bluffing. Betting from an early position can imply that you do have a strong hand, but bluffing too often will result in others picking up on it and can be disastrous, particularly when aggressive bettors are at the table.

When the US federal government finally succeeded in shutting down the number games run by the mob, it wasn much longer until individual states had their own lotteries. Of course, where the mob used to return 60 80 cents on the dollar, the government would return 40 60%. The Western Canada Lottery Corp. has a 3 game, almost exactly like the old number mob game, that returns 50%. Canada biggest national lottery, Lotto 6/49, purports to pay 53%, but that figure does not include the fact that the jackpot is paid yearly over an annuity, or paid at a reduced amount as a lump sum.

So said PML (N) whip Sheikh Aftab who is perhaps the most under rated politician in the ruling party. At least half of the government functioning in the Parliament rests on his shoulders and yet he remains a junior minister. He was responding to Javed Hashmi's assertion that he had never aspired to become the prime minister. No sooner had Aftab uttered these golden words than walked in Nawaz Sharif, accompanied by a band of his senior ministers who are habitually absent from Parliament when the prime minister is not around. Aftab's description of the prime minister's life was written large over the face of Nawaz Sharif. Gone were the heady days when he relished his Kashmiri cuisine and could spare time for his music (he once showed journalists Zaffar Abbas, Nusrat Javed, Mohammad Malick and yours truly his collection of music, Geeta Dutt being his favourite). One could notice traces of sleepless nights and troubled days on his face even from the Press Gallery.
Government welfare, in the form of TARP, is such an obvious con game that even middle of  the road, pro business sorts are getting angry.

For someone who seems so pro GTO such as Berkey, I find it hard for him to have a single hand in his range better than what he holding. If you folding close to 100% of your range in this spot (I guess you can have some AJ/A9 combos), you become very exploitable. Nguyen has more than enough XsXs in his range for you to be calling here profitably, and while it obviously way better to have A9/AJ here than 99 (since you block Ax combos) and 99 basically doesn have any blockers to his likely FH combos here   unless you throw in A9 suited in there which even if it is in his range would be incredibly unlikely since between you and the board there only ONE combo of A9s   (UTG+1 range), I still think this is a terrible fold. Berkey is way better than I am at poker but PRETTY sure he gonna be getting a Doug Polk youtube video made out of this because it seems particularly bad. I be very surprised if Berkey defends this hand to people in the days ahead.

Moreover, since Japan public debt is well over 200% of its GDP the highest among OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development) nations the costs for servicing the debt will skyrocket as interest rates rise.
