You were just pissed that she changed plans on you and decided to start something, trying to bully and shame her into letting you have your way. If you want to be a part of this woman life, you need to listen to what she is saying, respect her relationship with her child, and check yourself when you feel that desire to bulldoze over her to get your way.

My excess wealth does not translate into a license for recklessness   one false move and I might double up Evan, who would replace me as chip leader.

It's a critically important part of any triathlete's workout routine because it helps increase the body's aerobic fitness level without significantly contributing to overuse injuries.

Even elite triathletes, who often train for 40 plus hours per week, include low intensity training in their routines.

"Verhoeven is always on the razor's edge," the actress explains. "Like in Black Book"   his 2006 feature   "you have the Jewish girl sleeping with the Nazi."

One of McNeer's most challenging assignments is having the students analyze a proposed and well publicized merger between West Pecos Pipeline and Gulf Oil.

Turn IMO is a jam. Maybe psychologically a half pot sized bet looks less scary and is slightly more likely to get called, but mathematically any reasonably sized turn bet leaves villain pot committed, so there really shouldn be any hand that he would call 60% of his stack off with that he shouldn also call his entire stack off with.

One is not required to connect with and remain close to people in that small town. I don often peruse social media but when I do I can believe how many people are still close. They still hanging out, in each other weddings, getting together for little reunions. I always felt weird and out of place in high school and part of me believed I was destined to social isolation because I was never felt particularly bound to anyone or any group. I really believed it was normal to stay close friends with a least a group of people from "home." Now I have the greatest friends I could ask for, none of whom are even from my home state.
The amateur pro loves to play draws, even things like unsuited one gap shit out of position. They probably read somewhere in a poker book that they shouldn do this, but they also read the section on implied odds and badly misunderstood it.

Similar thing happened at my school. In 6 grade I was placed with another friend to a desk clump with a boy that was the "weird kid". the teacher told us in private that all the other kids had asked to be moved out of his desk clump and so she wanted us to sit with him, probably because we weren't total dicks like the rest of the class. A month or so later he died. Almost my entire class and people from other classes went to his funeral, the same people who didn't want to sit with him, made fun of him. They went to his funeral so they could have a half day at school.

These sorts of things aren really tax breaks for corporations in the final analysis. Burger King "sells" these shamrocks to customers and therefore receives income that is otherwise taxable. Burger King then makes a donation equal to the amount of shamrock sales they made, and this contribution is considered tax deductible. So they end up in the same tax situation as they would have been in had they not run the program at all. They also make interest on the money before donating.

From July 9 through July 12, the Macau Poker Cup, a bimonthly tournament sponsored by PokerStars Macau, will see more than 100 players competing for a minimum of $129,000 in the main event. The event pales in comparison with the annual World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas, which draws in 7,000 players for a grand prize of $8.5 million at its main event, but the Macau tournament's organizers have high hopes for the game's potential in Asia.

Sports became central to the American higher educational system over a century ago as the real bourgeoisie consolidated power. the rising middle classes were able to translate their growing wealth into political power, they also had to find reasons to justify the fact that they, and not the nobility or upper classes, were the ruling elite. answer was that they were FIT TO RULE  fit in the mental sense, but also the physical one. bourgeoisie painted the upper classes as a bunch of debauched and effete males who could not man up to the job of running Wall St. or DC. working class men were manly, of course, but with degenerate minds and questionable physical fitness. bourgeois men were sound of mind and body. bourgeoisie was educated, but also sporting.

To state that there is a business elite is a bit misleading.

A public health approach emphasises prevention, it certainly provides support for people who do have problems, but the emphasis should be on prevention.

When turned, the moving coil generates a weak current initially as it in the presence of a weak magnetic field. But this then strengthens as the current running through the coil then strengthens the magnetic field in the iron bar. I think this would work because there are DC motors without magnets. I think only a weak magnetic field is needed to prime the generator. After it starts a current going, the stationary coil around the magnet then behaves as a permanent magnet would.

Looks like Funimation's officially severed ties with Vic Mignogna. His stans haven't taken the news well and they're accusing Funimation of firing him based off "no evidence" and that they're disrespecting him for after all the years of "service" he's put in for them and all the "money they made off from him". The measures Vic's fanbase have taken to defend him is so baffling. Saying that there's some SJW conspiracy against him because of him being a white Christian man; that most of the accusations against him are lies (despite evidence and testimony); and downplaying his actions as "just hugs". They're even trying to spread rumors about other VAs being harassers themselves while Vic was merely an innocent victim.

Being a new single parent is exhausting. I been there. Do you work in a place that offers family leave? Most daycares won take a baby until they are 6 weeks old in the United states. But whether you are a man or woman, caring for another human being in your family, will usually get you FMLA. I know it seems silly, but if you have to take unpaid leave, consider using food banks or other donation services near you. making sure the baby has a good babysitter, and is taken care of, is more important. Than making the money to feed them. Newborns are so fragile and untrained professionals should not handle them at all. I would say yes, make the money. but not if it means leaving them with someone who is untrained.

If you doing asset management and procurement there are likely duplicate functions at the parent that you could consolidate, put yourself into more of a process/consolidation role, and maybe change careers. You could find a way to consolidate IT w/ the parent, hang onto just the development/business development aspects of the job, and improve revenue/efficiencies/reduce risk/etc.

A "string bet" is a bet that initially looks like a call, but then turns out to be a raise.

While yes, the genocide was a military operation, not civilian, ASSK could have publically condemned it. Instead she stuck to the official narrative and denied the whole thing. Why?

I work in consumer electronics and something like this shouldn cost anywhere near 100k to develop. In fact, a talented hobbyist should be able to throw together something similar on an arduino pretty quickly. FCC cert shouldn exceed 15 20k (actually used the same lab they used for certification). My guess is the data is kinda worthless.

That open window, the stars, and the telescope are what make this picture special to me. 
I have a question, rumor is that Above and Beyond and/or Seven Lions will be here because anjunabeats has a stage. However, on the same day, anjunabeats also has a show in New York.

"Fuuukkk yuuuu, hahaha". Heard it several times. Do you think they just want to be nice in such a manner? No, that is just disrespectful and the reason is that they want to make fun of the laowai.

Hearthstone even at the highest levels only plays bo3s with changing decks, again leaving no room for skill expression. If it was like a bo20 or something I could realistically see mindgames playing a major factor.

Pretty much this. the fact that Frank is glorified and seen as some kind of badass shows just how fucked up our society has gotten. When TV shows torture and absolutely insane amount of hardcore violence but refuses to show things like the naked body you know we have gone off the rails.
I sure they want a "pretty" girl for their boy, but not some Jezebel of course, which actually means no one non imaginary qualifies, which means they get to keep him forever, which is exactly what controlling parents want.
