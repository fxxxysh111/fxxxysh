Come on, don be dense. the holocaust was actually fucking genocide, they were trying to exterminate an actual fucking people. taking non combatants and putting them in camps to be worked to death or straight up killed, there is a big difference between that and some civilians accidentally being killed by a 500 pound bomb when a compound with some hajjis in it gets taken out. even the prisoners we took whether japs or krauts were provided food and not killed after being captured under the Geneva conventions. it wasn perfect and there were some incidents of people killing prisoners but nothing is perfect and its far from millions being slaughtered for who they are. you just sound anti American in general. not someone who actually cares about the distinction

I think the high APM (still have to go check the video myself for it) hurts the significance of the event quite a bit. When I heard about this event, my first thought was   "Can the AI destroy humans at macro?" Someone mentioned there was an APM cap, however, but I still imagined the AI being able to split and control armies far better than a human. And that what happened   using high AMP as well in an obvious exploit of conditions otherwise intended to make a comparison between human and machine strategic intelligence.

Within the SME sector, there will be particular problem spots, especially for those in the agriculture, transportation and energy intensive manufacturing sectors. Even though the government casually assumes that all businesses will pass on all these extra costs through higher prices, many of these businesses will not be able to do so because of the nature of their products or competition from outside the country. In fact, more than half of CFIB members in those four provinces tell us they will not be able to pass on any of the additional costs in the short to medium term. It is a problem the government acknowledged for large businesses one the OBPS was expressly designed to minimize but which small firms are expected to handle unaided.
"Because Pitchford agreed to have his private 'bonuses' counted as advances upon the royalties owed to Gearbox employees, those employees   and their families   won't receive any of their accrued royalty or 'profit' shares until work repays Randy's bonuses to Take Two Interactive," the lawsuit says. "This is particularly tragic exploitation, because these millions are being siphoned to Randy Pitchford's personal accounts instead of funding the development of 'Borderlands. worse, Callender's lawsuit claims Pitchford left a USB drive at a Texas Medieval Times restaurant in 2014 containing sensitive Gearbox corporate materials and a personal collection of underage pornography.

Given Blair Reeve's strong performance poet background, this is a book to be read, indeed chanted, OUT LOUD. I can well see him onstage doing exactly that.

The laughs are aplenty, but director Zak Penn doesn't just use the actors as a vessel through which to deliver comedy; he constructs them as fleshed out, believable human beings, and when genuine drama arises between them, he isn't afraid to look it in the eye and deal with it maturely.

What are his check raise bluffs? I think he could have a lot here. That flop hits his range much harder than yours. Depending on villain style of play he could have suited 9x w/ Backdoor Flush trying to fold out any two overs while still having a lot of good turns to barrel. Or, a 5 with a pair or backdoor flush draw. When he check raises to that sizing he probably does not have a very merged range. So, by firing a pot sized bet on the turn he is representing the nuts and some percentage of sets. Why would he be trying to barrel money in the middle on the turn with only the nuts in his value range? I mean the sizing is pretty sick because if you call the turn the SPR on the river is so low you are calling with anything, which means you are folding the turn a higher %, BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT YOU TO FOLD THERE WITH THE NUTS????

By following line 2 the tentacle next to Sire won be able to hit you.

Anti Pakistan sentiment in America does not stem from any innate hatred or mistrust of Muslims, or jealousy of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal either.

Everyone else in the movie is interested in following rules because they are the rules, not the purpose that those rules are actually supposed to serve. You go to work because that what you supposed to do. You go to school because that is what you supposed to do. While his refusal to follow any rules, or to acknowledge the point of said rules does move him firmly into the realm of he there to point out the absurdity of the people around him. I mean, if I actually knew someone like that, I think that person needed to be medicated or arrested. I find it easier to think of him as an idea than a character.

Thanks for the response. The article also mentions Screen Size Points and indicates that those are what is used for CSS. In terms of that measurement, it gives a width of 375px for the iPhone 6/7/8.

(I done simpler codepen tests already and verified that this is normally the case). But something about this code is making the screen width come out as 569 instead of 375 and my max width: 400px media queries aren firing.

This experiment is definitely worth it (I don't have any real food sensitivities)   I do feel better when I'm not consuming grain, and I have more energy when I'm eating tons of vegetables.

I've been steadily losing weight since I completed my last round just by following the meal template at home and maybe sneaking something fun on the weekend. My rosacea is clearing up and I've definitely lost bloat.

That because while it is a fucked up drug, it neither cheaper nor as addictive (in the sense of drug seeking behavior) as something like meth or heroin.

It is important to check online poker room lobbies because the information can be found there. You just have to click the corresponding buttons. In an online poker room, the lobby contains the average pot size, how many players are checking the flop, the number of hands which are being played on an hourly basis, who are the players entering each game, and people who are on the waiting list. You can also know which and how many of the games of a specific limit are underway.

"The Ottoman decline thesis" is a term we use to refer to a paradigm in Ottoman history that was predominant for most of the twentieth century. The decline thesis divided Ottoman history into two broad eras: a "rise" in which the empire borders were expanding, its institutions were functioning smoothly, and its leadership was capable, and a "decline" in which the empire borders were shrinking, its institutions were decaying, and its leadership was incompetent. The period in which the empire began shifting from one state to the other was usually placed around the death of Sleyman the Magnificent in 1566. Not all historians approached the empire history in the same way, but this general view became very widespread as a basic framework for Ottoman history as a whole. The idea was, in effect, that the empire "worked" properly during the first half of its history, and was dysfunctional during the second half of its history, the occasional strong leader aside. The Tanzimat and its accompanying reforms during the nineteenth century were interpreted as an ultimately unsuccessful effort to stop this inexorable decline.

Free poker calculator gives you information regarding the cards in hand, the status of the table, the playing styles of the opponents, community hands, and how aggressive your opponent is. Taking into consideration all these stats, you can calculate and decide your move, before you place a bet. So, in one sense of the word, a poker calculator acts as a personal coach. Many people think that it is illegal to use a poker calculator, however, it is just a myth and many people use it in a game of online poker.

Collins told investigators he chose to use a "blunt object" instead of the axes that were nearby.Collins added that he was "really, really drunk," and that Kulpa "gave me a lot of alcohol and I was stoned as hell." He also said she was hitting on him and was making him uncomfortable, according to the affidavit.But Collins also said, "I shouldn't have done it anyway," and added that, "I did think she was dead," according to the affidavit.Collins told investigators he only struck Kulpa once, although they noted, in the affidavit, that the woman "suffered two very serious injuries to her head."In a short interview at the hospital, Kulpa told investigators she did not remember the assault, only that she had picked up Collins and his friends while they were hitchhiking.While Collins is a juvenile, the Boulder County District Attorney's Office took the rare step of charging him as an adult.Berkenkotter initially prohibited prosecutors from publicly revealing what charges they filed against Collins because the proceedings in the case are temporarily under seal while she considers a defense motion to permanently seal all documents in the case.On Monday, though, District Attorney Stan Garnett released the charges his office filed last week: attempted first degree murder, first degree assault on an at risk person, and two crime of violence sentence enhancers.Collins could face eight to 24 years in prison on the attempted murder charge and 16 to 32 years in prison on the at risk assault charge, Garnett said.The teen remains in custody on $1 million bond and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in February..

Your comment was removed, but for your future and information  it is very common for abused children to literally wipe memories. It's a survival skill as a child, and it shows up in brain scans. There are blocks between the short and long term memory storage for a lot of us. If reminded, I can pull up some of the memories but otherwise they actually disappear. One of the reasons I wrote down the worst of my Mom's abuse was because I would literally forget incidents unless reminded. That's the joy of neuroplasticity in children  they will literally re wire their brains to survive abuse but it messes with you as an adult.

Some things to find out: Is it tournament style, or can you buy in multiple times? That effects strategy because you need to determine how much do you want to play? If you want to play all night and can only buy in once, your only real choice is to play tight/weak (that is, only bet when you have great cards and get flustered when someone bluffs you). Much better to expect to buy in a few times (since it is your first game) and be a little experimental in your strategy.

One tip that I always give my friends who are just starting off on trackdays is to get the butt (since it seems like you are learning the concept of shifting around) ready for the turn farther in advance.

Do not promote Terrorist Organizations. When Greece gains indepence, Greeks stay in there. The more land the Ottoman Empire lost, more Muslims/Turks came to Anatolia and the non Muslims stayed in the lost regions.

Uskup, one of the cities provided most soldiers for the anakkale, where is it now? As you see, this is a general trend of that time. National states rise and they expel minorities which were Turks in that case.

It was an outstanding effort in support of the Jim Bruce Urology and Prostate Cancer Trust at the third annual Poker4Prostate fundraising event. Hosted by a committee of local men and held at the Black Duck Brewery in Port Macquarie, the funds raised will go directly to the Trust for crucial urology services. Poker4Prostate committee member Stephen Mitchell said all who attended the event embraced the cause, playing competition poker as well as purchasing over $2000 worth of raffle tickets and bidding on over $11,000 of auction prizes. Bruce Burnham from WPT League ran the poker competition with enthusiastic punters all vying for the major prize. Trustee Jamie Bruce was delighted with the significant donation made to the Trust. "This fundraising effort is an incredible gesture from the Poker 4 Prostate committee who all volunteer their time and effort to raise these much needed funds" he said. Trustee and local urologist Dr Nader Awad addressed the Poker4Prostate crowd with a light hearted presentation aimed at increasing awareness about Prostate Cancer and what men can do to try and reduce the impact that it could potentially have on them by encouraging early detection. With over 18,000 estimated new cases of prostate cancer to be diagnosed in 2016, it has never been more important for males to keep this symptomless disease front of mind.
