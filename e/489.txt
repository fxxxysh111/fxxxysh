Which is encouraging and touching, but it doesn't really land anywhere.

Just to give you a glimpse of how things used to be, there was four of us who originally started getting together. After about 6 months I found the 200 TriColor Triple Crown Poker Chip Set with Clear Cover and Aluminum Case, which of course was well accepted from my friends. Over time our group went from 4 players to 9, and then right before the end of the year we had 18 players. The funny thing was I didn't know half of them.

What I asking is, what has changed in online (and live poker) int he last 5 7 years. I used to read websites and blogs, and watch poker videos, and I been on a 6 7 year sabbatical.

The news and the fire department have done this boy and his family a great disservice. How hard is it to say "The dog bit the boy. We will have more details when the investigation is complete." Anyone who ever said "The kid reached through the fence" is lying because it is a sold vinyl fence. The same fire department that first said that now says the kid reached under the fence. I find it much more likely the dog went under the fence like the family said. BTW I can find where the family ever said anything different. People are mistaking the fire department changing story when they get caught in a lie with the family changing their story.
Small stakes online players face different challenges. Transitioning from online poker into live cash games practically guarantees smaller profits, since cash games move more slowly and players can only be in one place at a time (online, players were able to play multiple tables simultaneously). With all this in mind, players both large and small have been rethinking their vocations. Faraz Jaka, a Chicago based pro who has won more than $4 million online since 2006, has spent much of his newfound free time promoting a side business a caster board company named Axis Casterboarding. Ethan Ruby, a smaller stakes player in New York City, has redoubled involvement with Poker4Life, an organization he co founded to host charity poker tournaments as fundraisers for other nonprofits. And after two years of playing 40 hours a week online (and earning a rough average of $1,200 per week), Matt Lessinger, 36, of Alameda, Calif., expects to take a full time job as a floor manager for a local card room. "Online poker was a great source of income for a while, but I am not prepared to rearrange my entire life to keep it going," he says. "Will I go back if and when it's legalized again? Probably. But if I don't play it ever again, that'll be okay, too; there are plenty of other options in the industry."

He need not have forced the truth from the reluctant Theban herdsman; but because he cannot rest content with a lie, he must tear away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived so long.

The immediate cause of Oedipus ruin is not or gods oracle said that he must discover the truth and still less does it lie in his own weakness; what causes his ruin is his own strength and courage, his loyalty to Thebes, and his loyalty to the truth..

Een spoor van geocachen volgend wandelden we verder, door de wijk met de ambassades. Zo vonden we een cache bij de ambassade van Irak (!, hard bewaakt natuurlijk) bij een mooi oud houten blauw huis (Pogodin wooden hut, 19de eeuw), het Maiden Field's parkje en het prachtige kleurrijke (wit, rood, groen, goud) kerkje Church of St. Nicholas in Khamovniki. Dat kerkje was ook van binnen heel bijzonder: de Orthodoxe kerken zijn zeer sfeervol! Overdadig versierd maar tegelijk ingetogen, door de vele kaarsjes en de vele gelovigen die komen bidden (vrouwen doen steevast een sjaaltje over hun hoofd dat ze blijkbaar altijd bij hebben). We wandelden na dit bezoekje richting rivier, waar net een boot klaar lag. Perfect, zo konden we meteen een rondvaart maken op de Moskou rivier. We zaten gezellig op dek, met een frisdrankje, waarbij we voornamelijk beboste oever zagen. Van uit de verte zagen we ook het klooster liggen dat we 's ochtends bezocht hadden. Aangezien ik dacht dat we een rondvaart genomen hadden, was ik heel verontwaardigd dat we bij Kievsky Vokzal uit de boot gezet werden. Blijkbaar hadden we een enkeltje en geen rondvaart (dat laatste kan je dus enkel kopen bij begin en eindpunt). Heel jammer, want het mooiste stuk van de vaarroute (bij het Kremlin) hebben we zo gemist.

Thomas Nast (1840 1902) was an extraordinary talent who created the politically/socially influential political cartoon.

He also created the popular images of Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, the Republican elephant Democrat donkey, and the Tammany tiger. man got a lot of things right1.

Acknowledgement The first step to repairing a professional relationship damaged by distrust is acknowledging what took place to cause the offense.

The issue is that it is still a pain to switch back and forth. Because you switch your attention between your computer and your surroundings all the time, probably without really noticing. In VR you kind of "locked in" for the session. Ideally, if you have no pets/children to keep one eye on, and don snack/drink/smoke at all while using your computer, then sure you could sit there in VR with a million displays getting all kinds of things done. At least until your face is screaming for some relief. But if you want to do any amount of multitasking between your computer and things happening in the rest of the room, you not going to be removing and replacing the HMD every few minutes, you just going to stay in flat mode because that way less hassle. This is why I still see VR as "for fun" and not "for work".

This is a bastardization of Marxism Leninism as this is a very complex and detailed ideology, but you can summarize their belief as this: they institute state capitalism, where the new revolutionary government takes the place of the capitalist class and uses these funds to build up the country's infrastructure, economy, and defense. Then they transition into socialism once they material conditions are suitable for it, and from there once there is worldwide socialism they believe the state and the population will essentially merge and the state will thus wither away, instituting communism.

Homeland Security Officer. Long story short, we were doing joint investigations with the County DA office in cracking down on child porn in 2015. We knew about this site that was being used to traffic CP. Usually, it a slam dunk. One suspect had posted his email on said site and we found a magistrate who was willing to give us a warrant. We found no CP on the suspect email address and it looked like the person using it was using various aliases. We traced the IP to a home and got another warrant. When we knocked at the door and announced ourselves, we heard banging. We were let in by one of the occupants and I found a male with bloody hands and a smashed up computer. We detained him and had a tech try to retrieve data. Unfortunately, he was unable and would have to send it to a data recovery expert. My hail Mary was to interrogate the suspect and hopefully he would admit to having CP and I could arrest him. Before I could say a word, he told me he wasn going to say shit without a lawyer and he did nothing wrong. We came and left emptied handed and I could make no arrests. I pulled strings to get that computer analyzed and they could not get anything from it. I had to close the case.

Saxophones have an octave key that breaks the fingerings into octaves. Playing just the index finger is a B. When the octave key is pressed, that B sounds an octave higher. Clarinets, on the other hand, have a register key that breaks the range into registers. On clarinet, playing first finger and thumb is a first line E. When the register key is pressed, that same fingering sounds a B, above the staff. To get a second register E, the register key, the entire left hand, and the first two fingers of the right hand need to cover their respective holes. The clarinet fingering system is more complicated.

Well, more realistically, the word "poker" probably finds its origins in the underworld of thieves. Some of the card hustlers may have already been using the expression since "poke" was a slang word used by pickpockets. It is believed that card hustlers, who emerged from that same underworld to cheat unsuspecting opponents, used the word in relation to their card playing victims.

In general a 3 phase motor must have all 3 phases continuously available to run correctly. Loss of one or two phases will result in a very high current being drawn on the remaining one or two phase windings. These windings will overheat. How long this will take depends on the individual motor and the load it is driving at the time. Typically a minute or so is sufficient to burn out the windings. a water pump such as used for a swimming pool) should always be protected by a special switch which will cut the power completely if one or more phases are lost. Such a switch will normally cost about 1/10th the cost of the pump it protects and is thus a very good investment. (Full Answer)

Some people approach credit like a poker game, with the mentality that you can lose money if you don play your cards. Although it always advisable to pay off your bill in full every month to avoid interest charges, not using credit cards at all can actually backfire when it comes to your credit score. If an issuer looks at your account and sees that there hasn't been any activity for a while (how long varies, but more than a year is a good rule of thumb), they might close it.

The Boulder District Attorney's Office has also filed two crime of violence sentencing enhancements in the case.Prosecutors allege that Collins struck 71 year old Katie Kulpa in the head with a fire poker at her Lefthand Canyon residence in September, fracturing her skull and nearly killing her.Prosecutors also allege that Collins who had open charges from an unrelated incident at the time of the alleged attack cut off his ankle monitor when he fled and altered his appearance to avoid capture.However, testimony revealed that Collins suffered a chaotic childhood, which resulted in stunted emotional development and left him less mature than the average 16 year old.Collins also reportedly suffers from multiple mental health and substance abuse issues that have been left largely untreated. He was hospitalized twice in the year leading up to the alleged attack on Kulpa for "suicide and/or drug overdose," records show.Kulpa had taken in Collins and his two friends after they became stranded in the mountains near Ward in September.

I don think so, I think the majority of people just really haven considered the topic that much, and default to the opinion that existing is better than not existing. Especially when you consider that people are likely to overestimate the quality of life of a farm animal, to protect their self image as a good person. Then throw in the fact that it extremely common to conflate the "success" of a species (in terms of population numbers) with the success of an individual (in terms of quality of life), and it a really easy position to arrive to.

My current and not yet implemented idea is this: For each tile, try to make a) a street b) a set c) a pair. If none works (or there would be > 1 pair), go back to the previous iteration and try the next option, or, if this is the highest level, fail.

Over the past week there has been a guy that comes in, asks if we made any more decaf, grabs a cup, gets a little in the cup, takes a sip then dumps it into the little drip tray and proceeds to put the cup back onto the stack of cups. He has done this at least 3 times a day for a week. He came in 20 minutes after he did it a little bit ago and looked at the decaf sitting on the coffee maker, proceeds to ask again if there is decaf, asks if it fresh and goes to grab a cup. I told him that yes it was fresh and if he wasn going to throw the cup in the trash and put it back on the stack again I wouldn be able to continue to let him get coffee as he keeps contaminating the cups and wasting the coffee.

To live in a city, you now have to make 3 5 times the average wage in that city, to live in that city. And this is becoming a serious problem even in NYC, as that cost to wage ratio is blobbing out to all the suburbs that used to maintain the working base needed to make NYC function. So even though the entire region is designed to funnel people into the city on a daily basis, the cost of living is making it prohibitive for those people to go there and actually work..

The C7 numbers are only slightly more encouraging. The first two weeks of the new TV season saw the networks average a boost of three tenths of a ratings point from live same day to the extended dance remix of C7, which translates to an additional 386,550 members of the demo who didn't break the social contract when the commercials began playing.

El Potro debuted in 2006 with a location in Somerville's Union Square, and most recently opened a larger space in Malden. Each is a riot of color and filled with hand carved furniture painted with scenes of Mexico. While each serves a simple taco selection   think: pork abobada on scratch made corn tortillas   El Potro offers much more atmosphere than your typical mom and pop. A live mariachi band regularly plays, and a lively karaoke scene takes over on weekends.

I read the entire article, so no I didn ignore context. What do you want them to do, continue losing $2 million every four years to house 100 residents in an area with probably the highest cost of living in the entire city? That doesn sound reasonable does it? What does sound reasonable is to sell the property you are losing millions on that is located in area that is not conducive to the income of your residents; and as a result of the sale, be able to relocate all 100 residents and provide 200 MORE low income individuals housing. What the hotel and the city want to do with the parking situation is completely irrelevant to the fact that CMHA is doing what is right financially and what make can make the most impact to the population they are designed to serve.

The IMF has also constantly endorsed heavy government domestic bank borrowing to finance the budget deficit at the cost of the private sector that stands crowded out. At the same time, the unmanageable domestic debt servicing liabilities that have become the single largest budgetary expenditure item do not appear to bother either of them.

Its totally fair to be turned off by gay sex or straight sex respectively. Unfortunately far to many gay people are like that guy you talked about, where they forgotten how to have a personality, and they make everything about their sexuality. Sex is very deeply engrained in gay culture (which as an aside, i reside a deep burning hatred for, despite being bi), and guys like that make up for being vapid, uninteresting people, by having sex as much as possible, talking about it always, flaunting their sexuality as often and loudly as possible, and screaming about being oppressed in some way, all of this aside from being as flamboyant as possible.

As much as we'd all love to see Pacquiao and Marquez go at it for a fourth time, and as much as Arum would love to collect revenue from a fight that would probably generate over 1.5 million PPV, it doesn't make sense to stage another re run of the previous three fights between the two superstars.

48. FRED HOLLOWS Fred Hollows was a straight shooter. A specialist in treating the eye disease trachoma, he stomped through the Outback helping Aborigines keep their sight. Between 1974 and 1976 his teams screened 100,000 people. After giving sight to indigenous Australia, he did the same in Africa. The wild colonial boy of Australian medicine with the gruff voice and tender touch was probably the first doctor to give life to the "aid abroad" crusades that have become a calling for medicos with a conscience. Hollows died in 1993 of cancer, but the sight he gave others lives on forever.

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in Brady, makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence. But we think the Due Process Clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant..

The obvious solution kill all the remaining Palestinians is off the table for the time being, but what choice do they have? They are unwilling to integrate these people into Israeli society, for fear of a Muslim majority. Perhaps they could conquer a neighboring country and do a forced resettlement. Or, if they want to be nice about it invest a ton of money in a neighboring country, on the tacit condition that it accepts Palestinians for relocation..

Then I say once you see new growth on him, you can cut the stems where it lost a lot of leaves and put the tips back in the pot to fill out the pot. Does that make sense? If it growing well I even reccommend popping a fewleaves off and throwing them in the pot to thicken it up.

I got a $200 pot or so allin (villain allin, not me) against a flush draw. He hit. There was some other river that cost me at least a couple of hundred.

There are a few gum brushes on the market that you can use. A relatively new dental product, gum brushes resemble toothbrushes, although their heads are generally smaller and the bristles are much softer and thicker. They cost roughly $5 to $10 and may be easiest to find online. Gum brush proponents say toothbrush bristles are designed to remove plaque from teeth, not massage gums, so you shouldn't use a toothbrush to massage your gums. Further, since the major cause of gum recession and injury is brushing too hard, using a toothbrush to massage your gums can actually be harmful [source: Earthority].

I was really shocked by how much they elaborated on everything. I know they big on transparency on CCTV and I usually appreciate how blunt they are about industry things, but this seemed shockingly unprofessional, even from Brett who big on the whole "brutal honesty" thing. I always respected his opinions because he been in the business a while but that what makes this even more strange to me. It not even like this is first only content, this is on YouTube and it seems like now Asher can either have a huge gap on his resume or list Cow Chop and have any prospective employers google "Asher Cow Chop" and find this pretty easily. When an employee is crap and you asked about it by someone considering hiring them, then by all means, but putting it out there like that just seems like it meant to tank him and comes off mean spirited.

In the market that we are in right now, it's not volume sales that we use to measure the effect on company revenue. It's not about building a massive pipeline. In the early days, it was first and foremost about making sure that people at target companies knew who we were and what we did. Now, our sales team has established relationships with all those target accounts. It sounds very counterintuitive to most marketers, but sales is not telling. We don't need new leads. We don't need new companies to work with.

These bacteria perform hundreds of functions required for healthy metabolism and immune response.Through enzyme secretions, bacteria transform metabolic and microbial wastes before they are discharged by the body. These wastes include cellular debris, hormones, chemical wastes, bile, pus accumulations, viral toxins, bacterial toxins, etc.For example, the body creates bile not only as a lubricant to flush wastes out of the liver, but also, to detoxify many of the poisons accumulating in the liver. 
Many people confuse people who are angry at the Chinese government for improper vaccine distribution as "anti vaxxers". No, we not anti vaxxers. Far from it.

Jess and I left early on Christmas morning. We had a relatively uneventful flight through Atlanta and got to Managua around 1 pm. You can always tell how developed a country is by it's immigration, I find. Well, let's just say that the immigration was such a cluster and there were so many people that there was a backup on the escalator and people who rode it down couldn't step off and therefore had to run backwards up the escalator. Phew. Once we got through, the last ones to do so (I pick the shittiest lines), Jess and I went to Budget Rent A Car. The line there was long and not moving quickly. So Jess scoped out Easy Budget Rant A Car (yes, the sign was misspelled) and 10 minutes later we had a Hyundai Accent at the curb :)

I not saying I hate it, and there some roughness to the build that I chalking up to it being in beta, but I really thought we had collectively kind of moved on from the the whole bleak, brown and desolate post apocalypse setting. I mean Fallout 3+NV were pretty great 10 years ago, and Mad Max was pretty darn good. 4 years ago. But now we got Fallout 76, Rage 2 and Far Cry New Dawn that all have a verdant and bright take on the post apocalypse and a much less bleak outlook. Now that doesn mean Metro Exodus won be good, but I think it going to look a little. boring compared to other games that scratch this itch.
