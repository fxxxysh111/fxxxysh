It always a shity situation because everybody is human, we all prone to make rash decisions that are fallible and wrong based on emotion. Adrenaline is a hell of a drug. While unfortunate, I think it really goes to show that while you shouldn fear the presence of police   you should definitely respect and acknowledge the fact that those individuals, every single day, are constantly exposed to hyperstimulated environments and want to just go home to their families. They are there because oftentimes they possess a unique personality trait thriving in situations like that and work well under pressure when others may fold.

"Nip/Tuck" is not supposed to liberate us.

Would you like to learn how to play poker like the professionals you see on TV? The internet provides everything you from the products you need to the information you need to know to reach this complex goal. If you are someone that wants to take learning into the real world it would be smart to check with any casinos in your area. Many of the larger casinos offer poker lessons at no cost in hope that you will gamble with them once you learn how. This is commonly done daily in Las Vegas, the casino capital of the world. If you do not live near a casino, professional tutors can also commonly be found in local classified ads or perhaps you have a friend that is willing to invest the time into teaching you the game. Someone interested in mastering such a popular game must have determination and passion. Although most versions of poker are fairly easy to learn, it is also easy to learn how much skill it takes to master it.

Don Steal! Never take food that isn't yours from the office kitchen or fridge. Carefully mark your own food with your name so no one will be tempted to steal it. If a plate of cookies or donuts is left on a break room table it generally means the food is available for anyone who wants it, but otherwise, keep your hands to yourself.. 
This is mostly because it is too boring to sit there folding hand after hand, and it is too scary to risk more money when you don't know for sure you are going to win. 
I understand your frustration, and I wish the system here in Sweden were faster and not so freaking gate keeping!  Maybe you can talk with your transgender clinic in Sweden and explain your situation for them? If you show them your papers and documents from your doctors in the US, then maybe the Swedish team can figure out how to make the process faster. If you bring your documents, the Swedish team will have proof that you've already gone through therapy in the US and in that way MAYBE they can start treatment much earlier than usual

They weren being passive aggressive, they were just disagreeing with some , but not all, of your post. They directly said they were disagreeing with you, even if they didn go into specifics. That not passive. They not trying to mask their disagreement in any way. It different from a backhanded compliment, which is completely positive on its surface, but negative (and usually critical, which this is not) in its subtext. Also, it was a really tame comment, so it not really aggressive either. You called it a criticism (which I assume to mean a personal criticism), but really it entirely focused on the content of your comment, and actually says nothing about you personally. Disagreement doesn necessarily entail personal criticism.
How dare you even fathom to ask such a fucked up question, by the way.

Sure, we may need a car to get from point A to point B, but would we ever need our car to have an air purifier? How about leather interior ceilings? Or a bejeweled fuel cap? To those of us who are still chugging around in a bottom of the line economy car, these amenities might seem utterly ridiculous. Some may gag at the idea of such excess and opulence. But don't be too quick to judge. After all, it wasn't too long ago that features like power locks and windows seemed reserved for the ultra rich (and ultra lazy). Now, not only do these come standard on most cars, but many feel they couldn't live without them.

Unlike the vast majority of politicians/pundits/commentators.Tucker Carlson solution reminds me of what the Romans did. Romans had an abundant slave work force. Instead of innovating technology, which would have cost slave workers their jobs, they just kept on using slaves. That didn work out too well for them did it?. 
X ray? or just second opinion? more palpation. etc?The simple field tests I mentioned, and thermal imaging are probably best   thermal imaging has the potential to expose a problem (or more accurately an area of injury) which hasn been considered or which was erroneously ruled out. X rays for those problems would require recumbency (putting her totally under and laying her down), but the catch 22 is those injuries are also likely to be seriously aggravated as she wakes up and tries to get her footing (I personally had a horse break his leg waking up after colic surgery, requiring his euthanasia   and he was even in a recovery room purpose built to prevent injuries as they come out of anesthesia), so tbh I wouldn recommend radiographs unless your vet it super confident it can be done safely.Honestly, aside from thermography your best bet for deciding neurologic vs mechanical injury might be a course of strong anti inflammatories and Robaxin (or similar muscle relaxer) for a week, followed by a dose of analgesic (one which provides good relief of pain without significant motor impairment) and concurrent lameness exam.

"Every home has its own signature scent," Brashear says, noting that air is a complex combination of all odor molecules, like laundry and hair care products, lotion, cooking smells, or pet odors, stinky shoes and other undesirable scents. She says that the odor cycle affects every home, since there's usually nowhere for those scent molecules to go, especially when the house is closed up during the cold and hot weather months. So, when scent molecules get released into the air they move throughout the home, then they settle into the couch, carpet, drapes, etc. "Then, as soon as somebody plops down on the couch or there's a spike in humidity those molecules get re released into the air," she says. And while many of us make it a priority to regularly clean closets, baseboards and bathrooms, she recommends truly cleaning the air with products that trap odor molecules and eliminate them rather than simply masking them. "Air makes up more than 75 percent of the space in your home and it's really important and often neglected."
She started to lose her strength and everyone was surprised, as if it were unexpected and unheard of.

Once your hand has put some chips out, you may not go back to your stack to get more chips and increase the size of your bet, unless you verbally declared the size of your bet at the beginning. If you always declare "call" or "raise" as you bet, you will be immune to this problem.

Expanding and promoting charter schools as a system though, especially when prompted in contrast to public schools, is almost always a tactic to undermine the public system, rather than address a particular need.

A typical enterprise spinning disk SATA drive can handle about 100MB/sec on writes, conservative. Worst case scenario, that drive is 100% full, so, let go with that figure. 100% of a drive needing to be rebuilt at 100MB/sec. So, use that as a multiple. The likelyhood of a second drive failing during a rebuild in such an environment is so far off the scale in terms of rarity that the choice of RAID level won even matter.
