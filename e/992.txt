Fischer (1882 1953 (?)) approached the National Socialists and Hitler as early as 1931, at which point he seems to begin his rapid and lofty ascent to the heights of Nazi banking. He simply put them through and thus made in the view of historian Kopper contribution to the destruction of the economic existences of Jewish citizens and societies. It is was assumed that by 1953 with no word whatsoever regarding him Fischer was presumed to be dead. The Aryanization process included two stages: from 1933 1938 the Jews were gradually removed from German economic life, termed by the Nazis as "voluntary" exclusion; after 1938, Jewish businesses and property were forcibly confiscated by the Nazis."

The Common Strengths and Weaknesses of the Year of the Horse Person Strengths The horse people are generally energetic, noble, free spirited and clever. They have ingenious communicating techniques and in their community they always want to be in the limelight, so they have good friends and are well liked by many people. Although they sometimes talk too much, they are cheerful, perceptive, talented, earthy but stubborn. They are able to come up with new ideas and active at work and refuse to be reconciled to failure, although their endeavor cannot last indefinitely. The Horse person is a sociable likeable person most of the time, they can take advantage of this by getting everybody to work together to achieve goals. Weaknesses The Horse person is patient up to a point, but they can be hot tempered. If you pushed too far, the Horse person can lose their temper. They cannot bear too much constraint. They then lash out (just like a horse) at others which can undo the good relationships they have built up with their good social skills. They can also be stubborn just like a horse. They are wasteful since they are not good with matters of finance due to a lack of budgetary efficiency. The Horse person has many followers but they are not always receptive to other points of view. They tend to interfere in many things and frequently fail to finish projects of their own.

Gun owners aren some oppressed class, and to compare themselves to Jews, or unionists, or even socialists, is to cheapen the murder, torture, and persecution all of those people actually faced for their real beliefs. The entire gun culture in the US is a manufactured ideology to sell guns and protect the gun lobby. The NRA is, and has been, their stooge decades. Your entire world view is colored by what the gun lobby and gun manufacturers want you to think. Its about money. Its about getting your vote over an issue that has no real bearing on your life.
I had a cousin who had an IQ of 150+ and was top scorer in his cohort while at a prestigious foreign university. He died at the young age of 22 because he ignored a danger warning to take scenic photos. As a result I am very cognizant of the fact that young people can sometimes lose their lives doing risky and silly things without considering consequences.

When people (usually angry men motivated by fundamentalist religions  Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Middle Eastern or corn fed white Americans) feel as if their lives have been destroyed by a state and simultaneously feel that there is no possible way to address their grievances, they will feel justified in the use of terror against the population in an attempt to get to the state. A story as old as the Maccabees and as new as last night incident in Times Square. Is the inevitable price that large states that control huge swathes of land and extract wealth from a variety of populations to finance the military might necessary for such control pay.

We live in this world where products could easily last much longer than they do today but are made to break purposefully as a function of profitability. This is the exact reason that manufacturers do not want us fixing things. 
Not really just my character, but my paladin and my friends cleric have a combo called "Divine Deadlock", which involves the paladin casting Compelled Duel on an enemy and then the Cleric casting sanctuary on the Paladin, while Paladin takes the dodge action (flavored as planting the shield hard between him and his opponent). The fantasy was of having the enemy mind go kaboom from being torn between attacking nobody but the paladin and yet attacking everybody sans paladin. Even though mechanically the monster still can attempt to attack anybody, I like that combo a lot and it was my very first spell combo I came up with in DnD.

Everybody loves Las Vegas. This is the place where we can have fun in the casino, go to nightclubs, shopping, and watched shows. However, if we can bring Vegas into the computer, that would be a dream come true. The online gaming industry has become a major phenomenon.

Our bathing and hair washing routines are based on a strange system of depleting the skin and hair of their natural oils by lathering up with soap and shampoo and then replenishing them with moisturizers and conditioners. We carry out this (usually) daily ritual for a couple of reasons: By Western standards, the appearance of oily, unwashed hair is generally unacceptable   and it just feels kind of gross to go without a bath or shower for more than a couple of days. Secondly, these natural oils can lead skin conditions like acne vulgaris, where sebum becomes backed up in the hair follicles, creating a smorgasbord for bacteria, which break the fats into fatty acids. These create an allergic reaction that presents itself as acne.

After the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938, the Nazis legalized forced Aryanization allowing the forcible confiscation of Jewish property.

I came home after a week away a couple of years ago to find a massive turkey nest in my backyard in the middle of my veggie patch. It's a giant mound about 1m high and 3m diameter. I decided to just leave it be and grow brush turkeys instead of veggies. The last two seasons it's been fun to watch the male turkey maintain his nest and the females visit to inspect the nest and if it meets their approval, they lay their egg. Up to about 30 in total. The male will dig into the nest every day to check the temperature inside the mound. If it's too cool they add extra soil grass. Too hot and they remove some.
