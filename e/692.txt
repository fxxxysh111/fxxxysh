I think his game here was to give the agents what they wanted   more information to deal with future Chris Wattes and the chance to do something else other than stare at the cell walls. Agents were stellar and developed a good rapport with Chris so they could get him to divulge more. Prison is boring AF  getting to spend the day not inside your cell is a rarity, he probably hasn talked to anyone about this in this amount of detail since he has been locked up and like one of the agents said it was most likely therapeutic for him and lastly if he is in the good graces of the FBI, it will be easier for him to transfer prisons in the future (for example asking to be moved to one closer to NC in the future to be near his parents).

At this point, we would just like to express our opinion that online gambling is just like any other activity, in that it is no more or less prone to abuse than any other activity performed regularly.

I can only imagine how much the VA spends yearly on things like Ensure Thic it that can become a lifelong expense..

It kinda important to point out that an annulment in the Catholic Church does not replace the divorce process; nor, contrary to popular opinion, does it render the kids of said marriage illegitimate. The marriage can be considered putative, meeting all the legal requirements, without being sacramental; a declaration of nullity acknowledges that the marriage, not being sacramental, was flawed in some way and thus did not actually occur. It frees the parties to remarry within the Catholic Church.

Why do some people seem so attractive on first sight? What elements go to make up their personality? From what sources do they draw their magnetic charisma? If there is no glow of charm in an individual, it really doesn't matter much, what else they may have. What the heart thinks, is the man. What are those qualities that endear a few in lightening speed to all they come into contact with? Love at first sight is an absolute truth; the discovery in a man woman relationship, of it being contrary, is sometimes a matter of time. But otherwise the dictum holds water.

The company would have also had to pay a large fine. The goal of this provision appears to have been to allow smaller companies to establish their websites in the California market before PokerStars could begin to compete.

In most poker variants, such as Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha, there are 5 shared cards, or community cards dealt. This is simply because the rules are as such. There are other variants of poker, such as 7 Card Stud (Every player first receives 2 cards face down, 1 face up. Then a player can choose to "throw cards away" and draw other cards.

In this variant there are no shared   or community   cards dealt.) (Full Answer)

I recently listed to a This American Life episode about professional poker players, who learned how to accurately estimate pot odds in Texas Hold Em based upon their hands and the revealed cards, rigidly bet/folded based upon those odds, and won a lot of money. Is there any reason I can't do the same if I knew how to memorize the calculations they use? If so, where would I start (what books/websites contain this info?) and why can't I just automate that process (or consult a table of calculations) and win a lot of money in online poker?
I understand the "it was her choice to have kids, not my choice to hear a crying baby" argument but I don buy it. She and her baby have just as much right to the flight as any other paying customer, and if we can make social allowances for a crying baby, then it no wonder our societal birthrates are plummeting. An airplane isn a library nor a hotel; it a mode of transport for hundreds of various types of people, including little babies who likely had their routine disrupted not to mention are sealed in a very dry air environment with major fluctuations in air pressure on sensitive ears.
Thank you, you speak the truth. I work at a bike shop and oh my god, if I had a nickle for every time I saw a damaged Schwinn or Mongoose come into the shop, I would have like, uh, lots of nickles. The saddest part is that most of the people buying those bikes at Walmart or Target aren even aware that they buying garbage, and then they come into our shop pissed that their wheel is bent or their brake caliper snapped off, when they "just got this thing 2 weeks ago." I once had a guy come in with a brand new Schwinn that sprang a flat just as he was taking it out of the local Walmart to his car.

Many poker players talk about EV, which stands for "Expected Value." Expected value is the amount you can expect to win on average every time you are in a particular situation.

With its accompanying fluid flow and variations in creep deformation, were necessary to preserve the nutritional status of discs and joints.These studies are consistent with a larger body of evidence that has evaluated the clinical effects of bed rest and immobility, both of which have been universally and thoroughly discredited as effective methods of treatment for both back and neck problems.Waddell, MD noted in 1987 (6) that there is a loss of 3% muscle strength per day with complete bed rest.The 1994 AHCPR guidelines on Acute Low Back Problems in Adults (7) warned about the potential complications of bed rest including a 1.0% to 1.5% loss of l muscle mass per day, as well as a 15% loss of aerobic capacity in 10 days.The very recently revised and released 1996 British guidelines (8) summarize the literature on bed rest, noting that there are now 9 randomized controlled studies on bed rest, and their findings confirm that bed rest is counter productive.Similarly, the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash Associated Disorders (9) confirmed that prolonged use of cervical collars probably prolongs disability.Today it is understood that motion plays a critical role in maintaining tissue and joint lubrication/nutrition for both discs and joint articular cartilage.We know that articular cartilage receives its nutrition through the circulation of synovial fluid, which is a filtrate derived from blood vessels within the synovial membrane.In addition, the synovial membrane also contains lymphatic ducts, which provide the pathway for the removal of waste products out of the synovial fluid and the joint space.What is essential to recognize is that the synovial fluid has absolutely no inherent capacity to circulate is no heart forcefully pumping synovial fluid to the joints. Its movement through the joint space is dependent on movement and changes in intra articular pressure..

Wow, what an episode. So, my conspiracy theory is that it no accident that those Gilead security guys caught Nick and June at the safe house where they went to meet Hannah. My assumption was only strengthened by the wide panning shot at the end of the episode that shows the house is essentially in the middle of an isolated area at the top of a snowy mountain without many houses or people around, meaning that the fact that the security guys caught Nick and June like 3 minutes after they came outside and less than 15 minutes after they arrived at the safe house is awfully convenient timing..

I just said in a post above that if a single parent can not afford to send their child to daycare that there should be reduced fee Im pro life for sure, but if you are making positive decisions to better your child(and your) future, then why shouldn we as a society help to support that!

Since you are already controlling for false positives rates with a fixed p value threshold, the question then becomes whether your false negative rate is acceptable. In this regards you made the claim that your false negative rate would be too high (your power being too low) to detect the putative effect size in your data, but you performed no power analysis to back this up. The acceptable level of power depends on the effect size you want to detect in your data, so that could mean 3 replicates is enough for one experiment, but 6 is required for another..

Why can the government approach China in a friendly manner and at least talk to them about these new facilities that are about to come online, which will practically kill us all? At least talk to them and show our concern, and offer to help or even offer to pay for better pollution controls for these plants if they refuse to stop the building of these plants.

This drama stealing reminds me of my alcoholic/drugging aunt who abandoned her daughter and my mother and father took her in. Growing up she was more like my sister then my cousin, we were very close. She had a tough early life dad was never around, also a crackhead, well when she turned 18 he came back into the picture she decided she wanted to move out and reconcile with him. Ended up being hooked on heroin in a short matter of time and for the next ten years in and out of rehab, over dosing, and stealing from my parents, grandparents or whoever. She finally didn come back from her last overdose it devastated us all but we were happy she was in a better place. Then at the funeral guess who decides to come in and make it all about herself after doing nothing for her child her whole life, my druggie aunt.

At the end of the Bronze Age (the Helladic period) the first advanced civilisation in Europe emerged in Greece. This so called Mycenaean period is named after the archaeological site Mycenae in the north eastern Peloponnese and lasted from about 1700 to 1100 BC. The Mycenaeans created the first written records of Greek language. The reasons for the downfall of this culture are still not completely known, but its end resulted in the Greek Dark Ages. The population rapidly decreased and innovations like script were lost. Findings from this period mostly consist of vases decorated with naturalistic patterns.

Chip on The Shoulder (whenever a creature fails an Intimidate check against you, you gain a +2 bonus on your next Intimidate check against that creature), or Civilized (gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) and Knowledge (local) checks) would fit Doc quite well, also.

Since I was fascinated by those two different interpretations and also because I felt this piece needed to be accessible to all listeners, not just those that had seen the musical, my ultimate decision was to do a combination of both interpretations combined with my own experience.

Then suddenly the TV turned off itself, and I almost shit my pants. I got the remote to turn it on again, and then a proper channel was shown, so no static image anymore. I still don't understand what happened, that TV hasn't malfunctioned before or ever since .
