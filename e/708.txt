From his POV, CO 3bet vs UTG open + HJ flat is a steal play. He forced to go with it with JJ/QQ to prevent this from being a 4 way pot.

IT guy here. So it seems like your OS cannot find your desktop folder for your user. It defaults to the one in System 32. There is many reasons why this happens but most likey is disk or folder corruption. Turn off your computer now and don use it again! It like running on a broken leg it will just make it worse even though it seems like it fine. Take it to a computer shop and have them look at it ASAP or at minimum have them image your disk so whatever data can be saved can be saved before it gets worse. Best cause it just a glitch in the OS and not a disk issue. The HM2 files and my pokerstars hands I find it hard to find them and Im not sure on how to save them. Do you recommend me getting an external HD? Or is a cloud better?

Whether or not a parish is liberal or not comes down to the priest running the show, but let be real, this is the Catholic church, so even the most liberal one isn going to deviate far from canon law. It more a matter of emphasis than anything. I been a member of two parishes on the East Side (St. Bernard on Atwood and St. Dennis; my eldest attends school at the latter) and they lean on the liberal side. I checked with my wife who is more plugged in to the other churches in the dioceses, and she agreed that Queen of Peace is also more liberal, than say Maria Gorretti. For example, I never been lectured to about abortion or gay marriage at either church (I know several married lesbian couples who are parishioners and/or send their children to the St. Dennis school), and I remember the St. Bernard congregation funding the CMC (Catholic Multicultural Center) after Bishop Morlino cut the funding about a decade ago. Now, I way more involved with my current parish   St. Dennis   because my child goes to school there, but I can honestly say that I love my parish community. It what keeps me coming back.

This is exactly what happening now with the whole misgendering issue, you forcing people to accept that someone has changed genders simply because they said they did. 
You have to decide what your life means. Does it end with a narcissistic hedonism that ends with you depriving others and making life harder for them so you can clog your arteries a bit sooner, or is there something unique in you, however small, that wants out, that wants to be transmitted to the next generation? It could be something as simple as a love of music, or family recipes.

So, why didn longships have "roofs" or shelters? The main reason is that they weren really built for very long voyages, but rather for raiding or short sailing voyages that might last a few days or a few weeks. It quite possible to be totally fine in an open boat for a limited amount of time at sea, and the "ships" really were more like boats, placing a premium on shallow draft so they could penetrate up rivers and creeks. They were also surprisingly small compared to modern ships, and were built using clinker construction, meaning that they did not have internal ribs or frames on which to hang decks (those were added later)..

Moreover, since Japan public debt is well over 200% of its GDP the highest among OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development) nations the costs for servicing the debt will skyrocket as interest rates rise.

Addiction, Adultery and/or Abuse by one spouse relieve the other spouse of any responsibility for keeping the vows they made at the altar. You do not owe this party bro any loyalty or emotional hard work on maintaining your role as a "good wife". He's getting damned close to adultery as well. All of that drunken flirting and late nights are not going to remain innocent forever I doubt they are innocent now, quite frankly. If you decide that enough is enough, you don't owe him a goddamned thing: he's already voided the marriage.

Kind, nerdy, independent and funny (even if just in private, because laughing together is such a great way to bond). I don particularly care if my partner is extroverted or introverted, shy or outgoing, but I do need them to have their own independent life, interests and friends (of both genders preferably). Which is why being independent and nerdy is so important to me. Kindness and empathy is also incredibly important, few moments are more attractive to me than when I see my partner being genuinely considerate, not just to friends but to strangers as well. I want a partner who is kind to me, but it is equally important that they just a good person in general. He said it first at around the two month mark, while black out drunk (his delivery was equal parts adorable, heartfelt and absurd) at a festivals minutes before puking his guts out. He didn remember after, I didn say it back, and all in all I just laughed it off. The second time he said it was about a month later, he was sober, very sincere and had clearly thought a long time about how to tell me, which makes it all the more awkward that my immediate response was "yeah. You said that before". Luckily he had both a lot of self confidence and patience and took it in strides. I managed to tell him I really cared for him but wasn ready to say it yet, so a month later when I finally did say it back, I genuinely meant it. He an awesome guy and I happy he was my first real love.

Many glass walkers use broken wine or champagne bottles. Unlike broken bottle necks or drinking glasses, these pieces have a relatively gentle curve. When you step down, the pieces shift against each other, moving the edges away from your foot. But the surface involved in a glass walk is not like your kitchen floor. In a glass walk, the weight of your body is spread out over lots of pieces, which have the freedom to move. When you step on a single sliver of glass, your weight is concentrated over that one sharp point. In addition, if you accidentally cut yourself on a piece of glass, the culprit is usually the movement of your skin along the sharp edge.

One story, possibly closer to the truth, has Yang Lu Chan visiting the village of Chenjiakou, Hunan province, China, in the 19th Century, where he found they practised a form of 'soft' martial art. He learned this art, and taught it to the somewhat effete members of the Manchu Court. These are the origins of the Chen and Yang forms of Tai Chi. The Wu, Sun, and Hao styles developed later. There is also a Lee style, although it developed separately, and bears few of the hallmarks of the other Tai Chi systems.

So while some spa indulgences are perfectly safe for pregnant women to sample, others are a very bad idea. Anything with chemicals, for example, is definitely ruled out. Hot baths, even if alternated with dips in a cool pool, are also unquestionably unacceptable, along with steam rooms, saunas, hot tubs, mud baths, hot waxes and body wraps, because they can all cause a dangerous rise in core body temperature. Typically, if the water turns your skin pink or makes you sweat, it's way too hot. If in doubt, use a thermometer to test the water temperature, and always pay attention to feelings of dizziness, faintness, clamminess, chills, extreme thirst, dry mouth or nausea. If you have any of these symptoms, exit the tub immediately and call your doctor.

Each player starts with only two cards and the remaining cards are shared, therefore it is an excellent game for strategic thinkers. In Texas hold 'em, like all variants of poker, players compete for the money in the pot, contributed by the players themselves. Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand the player holds.

Ever since the DDB creative revolution in the 1960s, debate has raged about the best kind of messaging for building profitable brands. On the one hand, devotees of the "hard sell," or persuasion based communications, argue that facts and rational arguments sell products and services best.

J'tais boulevers par ce que je lisais  ce sujet car j'avais prouv cette puissance de ressentiment chez les jeunes communistes que j'avais ctoy  Aix en Provence.

Hand 2) I think you can make a case for cbet or check here but I like cbet a little more, especially if you have a club in your hand. Yes BTN has some QQ TT and JTs in his range but I seen players do this with hands like AQ, AT AJs, 99 77, and some suited connectors. But you block hands like AJ KJ AT and KT.

If you at home I would imagine your SO won have an issue telling you if what you doing is hurting them.If you work too deep into the muscle you can bruise them or cause minor tissue damage. If you work to hard over the kidneys it will hurt.Nothing really life threatening.So watch their posture, if you notice any squirming, breath holding or sharp intakes of breath (just think about all the things you do when something hurts you) adjust your pressure. Sometimes just using a broader surface area like the palm of your hand instead of the very tips of your fingers will make a huge difference.I would avoid anything traction like; don pull on any joints.Otherwise have atter! Get the SO to treat you as well! There no better way to know what feels good on someone else then to have it done on yourself!If there is an actual injury or problem go see a therapist and they will often give you advice on how to self treat between appointments (and you can pick up techniques from them as well)I swear by both the stick and foam rollers.

If it were to follow this strategy, PMU could drastically reverse the Greek racing industry downward momentum. Although Greece, like France, has a history of horse race betting, the state of racing in Greece is in a downward spiral in which an insufficient number of races results in meager betting revenue, which further reduces the number of racing events. However, in order for PMU to export its proven business model of pari mutuel betting, Odie would need to have full control and supervision of the races in Greece, as PMU and horse racing associations do in France. A change so fundamental to the structure of the Greek horse racing industry might take years of legal wrangling within parliament.

Personally, I saw no issue with living together prior to marriage and I also would not be ashamed of getting a divorce. Would a divorce be unfortunate, inconvenient and painful? Yes, but I wouldn avoid getting one simply because of what others might think of me, including my family and friends.

When my actual vet came out on Wednesday, she examined the lump (as it is still there) , and she said that he badly tore one of the strips of muscle guarding the Trachea.

If a player knows the more popular and assured strategies like card counting, which is mentally tracking the high and low cards of the deck, blackjack is much simpler to sweep than other card games.

Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.

We gone several times during the soft opening in early December. The food is great, the staff are friendly, the space is open and clean. The only gripe we have is that over several visits we never saw an improvement in speed of service. I totally understand opening kinks, but one expects them to be worked out over the course of a month. Each time we there (with one exception when we were the only customers) the service is very slow with long spells of empty beer glasses. Also, three weeks in, they were still passing around a single piece of paper with the beer list or letting you read their list written on the back of their order pads. I kept hearing the reason was that their printer was broken. Seems like a quick trip to FedEx Office, Staples or UPS Store to make some copies would have been an easy and quick fix.

Myofascial Release: is based on releasing the connective tissue that links every muscle, bone, nerve, artery, veins, and internal organs.

When the body goes though a trauma the fascia tightens and loses pliability creating pain and restriction of motion. 
Koreans swear by the han jeung mak, or kiln sauna. The practice, which dates back to the 15th century, involves sitting in a room heated by burning pine wood, wrapped in a jute garment to protect your body from the intense heat. All the perspiring you experience is intended to relax the body, and the kiln sauna is touted as a treatment for shoulder, head and neck pain, and also is said to improve your skin tone. 
I could be wrong on this point, though. In particular, on exchanges that favour the maker in price improvement (do the opposite of what I believe Bitmex does), you end up with stupid situations where the price drops 90% because someone accidentally put on a sell order with a missing zero, and the exchange did the trades at the erroneous price instead of walking down the order book from the best (highest) buy price..

There are two other contributors to your shoe "size" as well: The shape of your foot (how the shoe's "upper" conforms to your foot) and the heel height that is best for you.

One of the things I learned from dating a med student, and just relationships in general, is to never expect anything without communicating. I think that asking for your SO to send a check in message during a super busy time might do more harm than good. Residents have a lot on their mind and a lot to worry about. The last thing they want is to stress about another "to do" item.My suggestion would be to wait for their workload to die down a bit and then raise the issue in a non accusatory way. Perhaps starting with the fact that you like hearing from them, even if they don have anything new to report other than working/studying. Bringing up that you appreciate a message or call because you miss them and want to know how they holding up is much better than asking for a check in. It seems less suspicious and more caring.This is absolute horse shit. However, the article is just a rant about how financial advisors aren obligated to recommend the best products for their clients. Well no shit! If you thought that branch employees have a fiduciary duty, you a sucker and a chump.The Ontario Securities Commission confirms that "adviser" is a legal term under securities law that describesa person or company that is registered to give advice about securities, whereas "advisor" is not.The OSC just uses a different spelling. It doesn mean that individuals with certain titles are legally bound to keep their clients best interests in mind when executing trades or giving advice. In reality, all bank employees are pushed to reach their targets. What more important to them: their job and ability to pay bills or whether you get to retire in 30yrs?
I loved Fallout 3, Fallout NV, and even Fallout 4, but I did not play them as much as I did Oblivion or Skyrim. I played a couple of different types of character in the Fallout franchise but they sort of ended up using almost the same gear and weapons after some time. I was just playing them again to go through the story another time or maybe go for a different ending and choose not to use VATS or Power Armor that time. That was it though and the hours I spent in those games reflects this. In comparison, I don even remember how many different types of characters I played in Oblivion or Skyrim and I spent a lot more time playing those games.

For example, in the above example when the opponent made a $20 dollar bet into a pot of $100 optimal theory say fold 6 out of the one time, but if you have been noticing the guy has been bluffing a lot more times than is optimal game theory, then the only way to make money is to call him more than is optimal according to game theory and try to out play your opponent or improve your hand.

At perhaps a younger age, I am in the process of withdrawing from what seems to be a similar situation. We have gotten to the point where we realize what has transpired between us, culminating in not only our relationships end, but a better understanding of how we got there as a couple, and as individuals with a past, and perceived future. She was unfaithful as well, an unfortunate common demoniantor in many of my relationships that has ushured me to reassess my own personality, values, and perception.

And bonds are currently rather unattractive due to the low interest. International bonds may pay higher interests, but many may still remember what happened to Argentinia government bonds. Also, should interests rise, the trade value of existing low interest bonds drops, so if you need to liquidize your bonds ahead of their maturity, you risk losing profit or even part of what you invested.

Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of where the jackpot keeps building until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Winfall, if the jackpot reached $5 million, and no one matched all six numbers, all the money 'rolled down' to the lower tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched five, four or three numbers. 
I had a similar problem. Stayed up late reading, woke up late, missed class, decided to keep reading, rinse, repeat. I felt dead and uninspired to do anything related to my studies. Ended up dropping out of university, taking a year off, getting a job in a service industry. It sucked ass. I slowly picked up different hobbies: astronomy, exercise, writing, reading actual published books(which I used to do anyway). Got back into a university closer to home a year and a half ago and am doing great. I still read LNs/WNs, but only a few, and I frequently take breaks from them to be a social adult.

While the effects of good posture may not be noticed immediately, in time your joints will be thanking you!
