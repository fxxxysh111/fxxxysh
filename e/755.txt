Many times when we just wake up with a stiff neck after one night of sleeping in the wrong position it is just that our muscles have gotten stiff and we need to get some blood flow to them in order to alleviate the pain. If you find yourself in the position that you wake up with a stiff neck, the worst thing you can do is not move it; however, it is equally as bad to try and jam your neck into certain positions that it does not want to go. Giving your neck time to heal and providing it with slow gentle movements will allow the muscles to loosen up and prevent any residual damage. If at any time while you are trying to loosen it up, the pain begins to get much worse or the pain becomes unbearable, you need to seek help from a medical professional and not continue trying to work it out on your own.

For perspective, the homeless shelter sort of sits between the expensive (bougie) town center area (luxury apartments, retail, restaurants, office building, corporate headquarters, etc) and the suburbs (garden style apartments, single family homes, town homes, schools, grocery stores and froyo shops, etc). The area is developing rapidly, new apartments and condos are being built, new businesses come in all the time, so the homeless haven affected anything business  or property wise. Moms push around strollers, teenagers wander, elderly men and women go for walks, men jog at 6am. it fine. It safe. I think the homeless are a bigger danger to themselves than the rest of us, honestly. Still, it not a very crime y area. I haven stepped on a hypodermic needle or been held at knife point, even when walking home alone late at night. I was worried about being hit by a Lexus than being assaulted by a homeless person.

Review the basics. Rule out any of the simple solutions first. Did you recently change the type of litter your cat is used to? Did you move the litter box to a new location? Did something dramatic occur in the area where your litter box is located (this could be a loud sound, a dog scaring the cat, etc.)? Did you recently clean the litter box and use a cleanser your cat doesn't like? Does your litter box need to be cleaned? Each of these are simple fixes: Go back to your old litter; try a different location as your cat is telling you he doesn't like the new one; unless you are sure there is nothing in the area that could have scared your cat, try a new location to see if the spraying stops; do not use strong cleaners (especially ammonia based ones) as cat's do not like these strong smells (basic soap and water or bleach work best, rinse well); replace the litter.

While the agreement forestalled major fiscal disruption for the time being, it was a ramshackle and inadequate attempt to deal with the problems that it was ostensibly designed to solve. The culmination of a protracted, tragi comic, and embarrassing spectacle, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (to paraphrase Winston Churchill) was not the end, nor even the beginning of the end. In less than two months, we may learn that it was not even the end of the beginning.

The Witcher 3 is the highest rated after completing HZD for good reason, its story and characters have a lot of great depth although the story is much, much darker.

Now half the time the food is out within 5 mins of ordering so you know it been sitting under a heat lamp and the chicken is usually dry. Sometimes we haven taken a bite of our appetizer and the meal is out. No more finger bowls either. But the service is so incredibly snarky and half assed at the ones by our house that we said hell with it. My husband once ordered a quarter chicken meal with fries and a garden salad to start. They come out with a quarter chicken with salad on the plate. My husband said no, the salad was supposed to come first and she said he was lying, she knows what she heard and walks away. A min later with a plate of fries and practically tosses them on the table and doesn even bother to stop walking. We complained but they didn care. Obviously you don expect gourmet food but compared to how it was, it garbage now

You can see the same principle at work with beginning chess players when they make colossally bad, game ending plays. Why suffer through that when allowing a do over makes the game more fun, and not incidentally speeds up the learning process? This gives a bit of a hint as to when do overs are considered acceptable: It depends on what's at stake. If the game's being played for fun or to learn, then the fun or learning opportunity is most important, so do over away! But if money's at stake? Well, consider Tiger Woods, whose many requests for mulligans in the last few years have been repeatedly denied.

As much as anyone, Rivers Cuomo established the contours of the modern rock hit as we know it, and as punishment he's doomed to dopily haunt its commercial confines forever. Despite his aptitude for tune, Cuomo's lyrics have always stumbled, and their gawkiness only simulates a vulnerable charm if you first encounter them at a particularly susceptible moment. So maybe schtick rock throwaways like "Zombie Bastards," "Can't Knock the Hustle," and "The Prince Who Wanted Everything" (somebody's surely rolling in his Paisley Park shaped urn) aren't exactly unworthy of the auteur who once sang "Flip on the telly/Wrestle with Jimmy" after all.

Why do Pakistani Grade 22 officers, federal ministers and generals spend this much time and effort on their sales' pitches to their American counterparts? Simply put, getting the American taxpayer to foot the bill for their projects whether it is getting new helicopters for the fight in Waziristan, new bridges for Swat, a new hospital in Mianwali, or new schools for kids in Jacobabad allows the DMG officers, the politicians, and the generals that run Pakistan to hold firm to their fig leaves. US taxpayer money, they hope, will allow them to keep things as they are, without having to change anything. Both USAID and American military aid are about keeping the GOR trimmed to the last flower for the bureaucracy, ensuring politicians maintain the power to give jobs as if they grow in the mango fields of Southern Punjab, and allowing generals to approve cantonment budgets as if they were communes in Switzerland..

I asked what he wanted to make me one, he looked through my collection and picked every mox and other cards too many to name and promised me next friday he have the deck case for me. Never saw him again.

I prefer a sniper or a war crimes trial personally. If Assad was behind it, he needs to pay in a painful fashion. But I do not agree with shooting missiles where the very innocents we wish to help could be killed. it is not worth the risk, to me anyway. I see your point about regional stability, that is important. Do you remember the stories of the Hearst Newspapers and the Spanish American war? I see a similar situation here. I try not to wear a tin foil hat on this one but it sure does seem from my perspective that the media is ballyhooing it all, blowing the proportion way up, when there is just as much suffering elsewhere. Let us also assume that Assad was behind it. Our method of punishment has the potential to take as many innocent lives. But in the end, Syrians will still be butchering each other. If this actually stopped their war and saved lives, I would be all for it.

My advice for having a conversation with her, based on my own recovery from an eating disorder and having to have this conversation with other people struggling, is to be open and honest, but prioritize her feelings and seek to understand first. I'd ask general questions first,  how is life going, how is school going, how is she feeling in general. Then you can get into "are you worried about your diet or weight?" Avoid doing this in the middle of her doing something you think is concerning, find a time outside of exercise/meal times. It's okay to express your concern about her. Just don't dismiss. "But you're X" comments, whether X is "already skinny," "beautiful," "don't look like you have an eating disorder," etc. are where you will go most wrong.

Some studies have suggested that for every person who has been diagnosed with celiac disease, there are likely 30 who have it but are not diagnosed. And given the nearly quadrupled mortality risk for silent celiac disease we have shown in our study, getting more patients and health professions to consider the possibility of celiac disease is important.".

Overwhelmingly, most casino gambling is on modern, digital slot machines. There is no human interaction or social time. There is evidence that slots have been engineered to increase addiction. These devices maximize the adrenaline rush and provide optimal sensory distractions that minimizes the reality of the player's real losses. Digital slots let gamblers play multiple games simultaneously. With one push of the button a player can run ten games all with different payouts (the familiar handle that gave these machines their nickname, "The One Armed Bandit," are long gone, replaced by a large, soft button/trigger.) Each game extracts the same wager and it's easy to see how a player can win while losing: two "wins" doesn't compensate for eight losses. However, the player's perception is one of success.

Here, Section 3.1 of the proposed constitutional amendment states: "Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, neither the General Assembly nor any political subdivision of this State shall enact any legislation, rule or regulation regarding the operation of casino gaming as defined in this Amendment." The term "casino gaming" is defined to mean "any game played with cards, dice, equipment, or . . . ." Implementing legislation that, for example, provided a means of reporting, collecting or distributing tax revenue from casino gaming would not involve "the operation of casino gaming." In no way would it affect games played in casinos. Furthermore, it is not repugnant to the constitutional amendment being implemented. It is the opposite.

I not saying bigoted views on this issue are unpopular. But for one to insist that what Islam "honest[ly]" and fully says about homosexuality aims to undermines things like: support for LGBT by ISNA (the biggest Western Muslim organization), the reconciled experiences of actual LGBT Muslims, and a subcultural history in Islamic civilizations which involve positive integration of homosexual and trans peoples.

From a purely socialist point of view, social democratic reform is criticized because it serves to devise new means to strengthen the capitalist system, which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist system.[164] Thus, it fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher David Schweickart contrasts social democracy with democratic socialism by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the welfare state and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism.

This is a f sacrilege. Lauri is a decent young talent. He is not being developed properly due to our disaster of a coaching situation. He will definitely want to be out of the Bulls in about two more seasons or less. But that is not the point. MJ is the best player that ever walked on the court and the best that ever played for the Bulls. This image is disrespectful and actually a little racist as well. The fact that people are celebrating 17 points during a loss shows how ignorant, immature and willing to embrace failure this fan base has become.

I would argue that it was backwards. The royal family were lunatics by the time the japanese annexed the country. Most of the people were living as they did 5 centuries before. Japan had been in an industrial revolution since the meiji period and the destruction of the shogunate. As for whether or not korea wouldve been split up, i would argue that it probably would have. Those in the north, the gogyro, had no love of those in the south, the baekja and silla, since tje two in the south had hooked up with the chinese to destroy their kingdom and unify the penninsula. Living here as long as i have, i know that asians hold grudges for a LONG time. This argument actually reminds me of that scene in life of brian where one says "what have the romans ever done for us?!" To which they list off a number of improvements the romans brought. Did the japanese do some awful things during the time between the annexation and the end of ww2? Most certainly. Were koreans innocent victims for the entire period? Id argue no. Many of the heads of industry here at the end of the war had been collaborating with the japanese the entire time. Ive seen enough pimps around high schools in this country today to know that many of the comfort women might not have had to be kidnapped and hauled off as is claimed. They couldve merely been naive girls who believed some officer promises of a better life. But persuing these lines of investigation into recent korean history will get your tenure revoked and banned from academia here.

She suffered through political turmoil in her childhood and teen years via a prison camp, and at a minimum was psychologically abused; my guess is that she was also sexually abused or at least ogled by the guards. I was so confused, and thought that perhaps he had only ever been sexually attracted to me, and had never really intended on having a real relationship with me. It was only after I started to worry about his personal safety that I begged him to just let me know he was ok.
And Mother's pre "FCK" work, if less noticed, has been out of the box.

I got some friends into Soylent and they were talking about freezing them, and I mentioned people here had mentioned that turning it gritty. So a friend decided to freeze Cacao and Strawberry, and then taste them frozen and then taste them. He was very happy, said it was a great texture, like a Fudgesicle, just a muted flavor, like it was watered down. So he said he could see addding sugar or Stevia and then having it around as a snack for him and his kids in the future.
I asked my friend to do this when she was biking to her car on a road with no bike lane late at night. I fell asleep before getting a reply and woke up a few hours later with no response.

Plenty of people are drawn to Tabacn for the thrill of bunking at the base of the 5,360 foot (and active) Arenal volcano. Yet it's the hot springs that run through the property and create natural thermal pools that make staying there such a restorative experience. Meandering pathways flanked by tropical plants connect the resort's low slung buildings, and the treatment rooms in open air bungalows take in some of the best rain forest views. Not surprisingly, the spa specializes in volcanic mud wraps and hydrotherapy treatments, like a sea salt spiked Jacuzzi session.

After you call his $75 lead you have $300 left and a pot of $280. Its a slight overbet to jam it in, but I think is the only option. Raising the minimum of $150 will never put any hand that has significant equity in a tough spot, and raising to $200 $250 leaves you just $100 behind which is super awkward on a lot of turns if flatted and will probably get overjammed by an aggressive villain anyway. May as well just jam it in with top set, you get called by a ton of hands that you way ahead of (JJ and 99 are toast, AK, AA, AJ, any flush draw/straight draw), really only QTdd or QTo have you in bad shape and even then its not terrible having 6 8 outs. And if V folds, you win a $205 pot uncontested!

Counting Turnover and RevenueTurnover can be counted by calculating incoming revenue, such as when inventory turning over brings in sales income. But inventory turnover can also be evaluated in other terms, such as the amount of time it takes you to sell the stock you typically have on hand.

Use "effect" as a noun meaning "the result of a cause." When people misuse "affect" with an "A", they often intended this meaning of "effect" with an "E." An "effect" in this sense is the opposite of a cause   an event that happens because of some other precipitating event happening.[4]

Hopefully you don't end up short stacked too often (were you really playing correctly) and someone outdrew you on a bad call or two, but when you find yourself short, you MUST be strategizing to double up. The best way to double up is to get heads up with just one other player with a decent hand. Even if you are behind with KQos and get called with A9, you are in the right spot to double up, but not against more than one player. Your poker calculator will always say to fold KQos against a raise, but that's when you go your own way and isolate the raiser. You are mostly trying to avoid being dominated here so I look at QJ, or pocket 8's etc. and feel I am not a huge underdog and may even be slightly favored.

The reason it surprises me to be a bit unaware is that I feel fairly engaged I am a speaker about twice / month, advise some recruiters I know, and have done a lot of contract work for the larger companies in the cities where I spend my time, and I have attended a lot of various conferences including outside my specialties, so I am fairly certain there isn much much of those languages outside small custom dev shops in the middle United States.

This is just further proof that Jaclyn Hill is a total liar! Good for all skin types and adaptable? OMG on what planet?! My mother is a self professed oil slick and I think this would still be a poor choice for her, given how incredibly mattifying this is; it would show all her wrinkles and skin texture. Not cute!
For millennia, people around the globe plopped into natural hot springs to soothe their minds and bodies. Some claim the minerals in the water are a boon to one's health, while others note it's the steamy water that's so beneficial. Icelanders, who live on a volcanic island riddled with these natural "hot pots," as they call them, have a long tradition of regular soaks. 
I feel like some are missing the director intent with this movie, it not about whether these things are true, or will come to pass.
The absence of Google's services might discourage the development of other Android equipped phones for China's market, limiting customer choices among a new breed of mobile devices fast gaining popularity in other parts of the world, he said.
If you have a regular dentist, just ask him/her for recommendations, and do a little research yourself as well. Don let your regular dentist talk you into Invisalign, though. A board certified orthodontist is the only one who should be correcting your bite. That said, many orthodontists will do a free consultation, so get a couple of consultations and choose the one you feel most comfortable with.

When did the dog stroller become ubiquitous? Why do we see water bowls for dogs outside restaurants when homeless people have to scrounge to get a drink? And airlines? The rules state that support dogs take priority over humans with allergies or aversions to the smells and potty problems that sometimes come with a canine passenger. Dogs are born with all the clothes they need on their backs, yet the dog clothing industry is a multi billion dollar business..

That is because these essential fatty acids are not present in a lot of Omega 3 products.Flaxseed contains alpha linolenic acid, which your body has to convert to DHA and EPA.For the elderly this conversion process does NOT work very well.Itis estimated that most adults would have to consume 10   40 grams of flaxseed oil to produce just 0.2 grams of DHA.So, if you want to get the proven benefits of DHAdon'trely on getting your Omega 3s from vegetable oils such as flaxseed.There is however now some products being produced from algae which contain good levels of DHA and do not require the body to convert the ALA to the DHA. 
What do you think about races that aren the posted distance? I signed up for my second half marathon ever, first trail half, and after months of training, I find out in an email that: "well actually, the trail isn the full 13.1, but we made it longer and now it almost 13.1 but still not quite. So if you a geek you just have to keep on running or something, and this is just supposed to be a fun run anyway"..

David then moved back to St. George where he did landscaping/yard maintenance and worked as a server at Texas Roadhouse. It was there that he met Haley Gratton who was also working as a server. Haley had just moved to St. George with her daughter, Sadie. Both Haley and sweet little Sadie captured David's heart, so he proposed to Haley after one of their shifts by taking over the microphone and singing "Love Grows" to her. They were married on June 7, 2014, in the Old Farmhouse at Staheli Farms.
When they eventually stopped doing that, in contrast to the other servers, it felt like a bait and switch. 
The truth is, most people who constantly complain about ghosting are guilty of doing it themselves. Of course there is always an excuse, or a reason why their situation was different.
I had two pairs and went "all in", putting everything in the pot with a satisfying push. I lost   just. 
So it's less like having eyes in the back of your head and more like having a pair of those novelty sunglasses with mirrors that let you see behind you. It is the only vertebrate creature on earth that does this.. 
As for the specifics of what he is trying to get through your head remember that he is the boss and sometimes you may have to do something you dont agree with (within boundaries of legality, decenty, etc) so it may just be a case of making your point and getting on with it. "I will do xyz but I dont agree with it and feel it will result in abc".

The Scottish settlers of Otago placed great importance on education, and started their university only two decades after they arrived in Dunedin. It was New Zealand's first university, and it proudly celebrates its 150thanniversary in 2019. This well illustrated and readable account of the university by Otago historian Ali Clarke is a fitting way to start the anniversary year..

If you see a bear before they see you, start to talk so they hear you well before you are close enough to scare them. Most bears don want anything to do with humans and attack because they are sacred. If you don scare them and keep your distance you can easily have a safe bear encounter.

This makes me think of my conversation with u/bkkgirl and I suppose that the ability to visualize things is on a spectrum, with the aphantasia types on one end and people like me on the other. Visualization comes so easily to me that the cognitive load of reading in a new language (one I learning but not completely familiar with) represents no problem to imagining what is happening in the story as I read it.

"She has expressed remorse in the witness box and I accept that is genuine." Judge Colefax ruled out a suspended sentence, saying it was too lenient in such a case, and instead ordered Harrod to undergo an assessment for an intensive correction order.

While Chastain learned plenty during the making of Molly's Game, including the in's and out's of the competitive poker industry and, one would imagine, more than her fair share of gambling lingo, she left the set with a few takeaways for her own life, as well.

On a more personal level, bios with bible quotes, song lyrics or "DJ/ENTREPRENEUR". Photos holding a fish or in hunting gear. Holding a baby and not specifying that it isn't theirs. Photos with girls that are clearly either ex girlfriends or flings. Faceless ab pics or ones where they're lifting their shirt up.
