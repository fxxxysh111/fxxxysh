My uncle got in a dui car crash, got out trying to run before the cops came and somehow fell over a rail (on the interstate he was on) and fell 47 feet. Miraculously, he survived, but even more ridiculous, is that he didn't stay down. He said he didnt feel any pain at all, just fear.

I don think as many people as it seems thinks that way. I think most of us KNOW we are a diverse people, but are guarded about our interests based on childhood experiences getting roasted doing anything that was a deviation from the "norm" . but kids are ignorant by nature, and the older generation was groomed that way.

Not a teacher. I am a school psychologist; I frequently test students for special education services, although some referrals are more behavior than academic based. I sometimes see students with above average cognitive abilities, but are heavily influenced by negative peer and role model behaviors. Those cycles are difficult to break and require so much self discipline. Our district has a lot of neighborhood gang activity and drug use, which frequently distracts students. There's also a lot of learned helplessness; many people in these cycles, no matter how aware they are of their own abilities, fail to believe they can overcome their environmental barriers.

The cost of medicine is way too high. The profit margins on healthcare products and services is insane. What can cost less than a dollar to produce can be charged at a hundred dollars. This would make healthcare insanely expensive if america switches to a single payer system and the US could very well regulate the cost of healthcare but healthcare interest groups would lobby to keep the profit margins so a universal healthcare system would stay extremely expensive. Healthcare costs are also driven higher because the American populace is very unhealthy and the cost to take care of everyone would be astronomical. The health insurance industry is also now too big to take down. Healthcare is about 17.9% of spending and creating a single payer healthcare system would be detrimental to the economy and everyone who works for, or has money in, the healthcare industry. I for one don't support universal healthcare. Not because I don't support the concept, I do like the idea on paper, but because the damage and trade offs are not worth the outcome.

They found that opiates interact with specialized receptors in cells that are primarily massed in the brain and spinal cord. When opiates enter these receptors, they hinder or block the cell's transmission of pain signals.

One guy, Meki, who had a restaurant, and his Dutch friend Edmund decided to go with us on a day trip to a town called Kalkan. Of course Meki had a friend who had a restaurant there and his cousin had a disco there, so we were hooked up in that town! We went to a restaurant in the mountains where you picked out your own trout from a stream, they caught it and grilled it for you. Super delicious! We were out with them until 5 in the morning and then we slept for a few hours and then left town   onto the next adventure!

Coconut water is naturally found inside young coconuts, and it contains a wide variety of minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, amino acids, and enzymes.It contains negligible fatty acids compared to coconut milk, which is a liquid obtained by grating the solid inside of the coconut. Coconut oil, a third health conveying food, is oil extracted from the meat of the mature coconut.Side note: Good video on Coconut oilIn a review in the journal Molecules, researchers call coconut water "a refreshing and nutritious beverage which is widely consumed due to its beneficial properties to health, some of which are based on cultural/traditional beliefs."In remote regions coconut water is well known as an oral and intravenous rehydration solution.Coconut water is famous for containing the electrolytes potassium and sodium, which are important for keeping the body properly hydrated.Potassium exists in every cell in the body, and one of its main roles is to draw water inside cells to maintain hydration.Sodium exists in the extra cellular fluid of every cell and is also involved in drawing water into the cells.An imbalance in these two minerals can cause serious problems with hydration and adrenal fatigue.Coconut water also provides a nice dose of vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, arginine, alanine, lysine, glutamic acid, and other micronutrients and enzymes that are anti inflammatory.In 100 grams of coconut water, there are about 5 grams of carbs of which half is glucose and half is fructose.Coconut water has received some negative press due to the aggressive marketing claims made by coconut water companies and because analysis of the chemical composition of the most popular varieties contained about half the sodium and 75 percent of the magnesium listed.Errors in listed ingredient content are not rare in the food industry, and the main concern with coconut water is whether it is pure or diluted since you shouldn't be relying on a beverage for all your nutrient intake needs anyway.The main advantage of drinking coconut water is that it provides extra electrolytes and antioxidants when you are training, making it useful for rehydration and great for overall health.Exercise, Hydration, and Coconut WaterRecent studies have shown coconut water is equally as effective as straight water or a carbohydrate electrolyte sport drink in replenishing fluids after exhaustive exercise, whereas word of mouth reports suggest it is far superior to water and sports drink options.The most recent study in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found no statistical difference between water, coconut water, and a sports drink on rehydration, heart rate, blood pressure, or performance from 90 minutes of exhaustive exercise in trained men.The coconut water did produce slightly better blood volume restoration than the other beverages.It's possible that the benefits of coconut water would be clinically significant on hydration status and performance if it was used for hydration regularly for a longer period rather than just one time, as in this study.Researchers note that coconut water may be preferable to sports drinks because it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup or added sugar, and the electrolytes and vitamins are naturally occurring rather than added in.Plus, it has rich antioxidant properties, which aid in neutralizing reactive oxygen species produced after endurance exercise.Antioxidant Benefits of Coconut WaterThe antioxidant content in coconut water may actually be one of its greatest benefits.It contains a wealth of micronutrients such as inorganic ions and vitamins that enhance the natural antioxidant system of the body.

Ignoring lands, Hearthstone and Magic have similar issues with lucky/unlucky draws and topdecking, but I mention one area where Magic has more effective randomness, for the better: The prevalence of instant spells in Magic, declaring blockers, and interactivity during your opponent turn more generally, means that there much greater uncertainty when you make an offensive play. And that what makes Magic great.

THE Indigo Shire has joined a statewide campaign in its determination to keep its home patch poker machine free. Mayor Bernard Gaffney said having no pokies protected the community from the negatives of gambling so the shire had joined 30 Victorian councils in the Enough Pokies campaign. "Large amounts of money are lost every day gambling on poker machines," he said. "We have to be extremely careful to protect the Indigo community and we support other councils in their battle to limit poker machines. "The big operators have been attempting to grow their gaming revenue in recent years by moving more machines to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities." The campaign, launched in Melbourne last week, urges the government to give the gambling regulator binding guidance so it makes decisions in the public interest. Of the 154 applications since July 2008, 93per cent of decisions by the Victorian Commission for Liquor and Gambling Regulation have favoured the gaming operator. "This is despite strong council and community objections in more than half of these applications," Cr Gaffney said. Candidates at the last council election were asked about their view of poker machines. "Each councillor is opposed to the machines, so if there was an application the council would oppose it," Cr Gaffney said. "We are so much better without them." Chairman of the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce, Tim Costello, said greater efforts were needed to limit the damage of pokies. "Each year, more than $2.5billion is lost in pokies across Victoria," he said. "That's almost $7million a day out of the pockets of Victorians and into gaming machines.

Experienced players also love freerolls   after all, there is no risk or entry fee, but there's still a prize pool to grab!Another lucrative reason to start playing at tournaments is the added tournaments, which are also called guaranteed tournaments. In a regular tournament the pot includes the money that players bring in with their buy in, so the pool is in proportion of the entry fee   The larger the buy in, the larger the prize pool.

I grew up in an abusive household too and it taken me many years to forgive and understand my parents.

If it worries you, consider waiting to guru a kanji before studying it outside of Wanikani..

THE IMAGES AND IDEAS OF RENE Magritte are known to millions of people who do not know him by name. So argues the art historian Sarah Whitfield in her catalog to the retrospective of 168 works by the great Belgian Surrealist that opens at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art this week, and she is certainly right. This accounts for the faint feeling of deja vu that even non  Magritteans sometimes get when looking at his work. Magritte died in 1967, but for the best part of a half century his images   or variants on them   have been used to advertise everything from the French state railroad system and chocolates to wallpaper, cars and political candidates.

I not a kid but I think the same. Feeling good by being useful doesn give you the right to marginalize others because they can or won be useful to society as a whole. I even think that if we released ourselves from the obligation of labor to secure thriving, society as a whole would improve. Maybe there would be freeloaders, yes, some for a while, but less and less with time. You can even get bored of doing nothing. And work positions wouldn have to go to people who would rather be doing something else, so most jobs would increase in efficiency and productivity. I done work for pay and work for free, as a voluntary, many times. I usually work harder and feel happier when I work for free, even if I have time pressures. So, somebody like you would have the chance to feel important by being useful AND wouldn have to do extra hours to make it until the next paycheck.

The second, being older and clearly a mother, gets less. At least she was somewhat slim, but had bad stretchmarks and a loose pussy.

In addition to the physical barrier, there is an important chemical barrier within the mucus that contains immune agents, which neutralize any toxin that comes in contact.Candida exudes an aldehyde secretion, which causes small intestine epithelial cells to shrink. This allows intestinal toxins to infiltrate through the epithelium and into the blood. The secondary barrier immune agents in the epithelial mucus remain the sole agent for neutralization..

My current full time job is at a Japanese market as a cashier and, honestly, though i love to meet with people, i don really want to keep cashiering for even another year. While it daunting to think about, I turned 24 this last December and I feel i called to do greater things with my life, both internally (relating to ethics and meditation) and in the world as not just a job but as a service. I want to go to massage therapy school, get my license, and further develop my skills in Tui Na, Shiatsu, and other "Eastern" modalities of body work. My teacher would sometimes mention to me that, in acupuncture school (i think in Taiwan) she learned more about just that: acupuncture, acupressure, and probably Chinese herbs as well. This is a path that i can see myself taking and, out of the interest in sharing experiences with this Reddit community, i was wondering what the experience was of other massage therapists and/or body workers on this site relating to continued education, perhaps in different countries, to learn massage specializations outside of the education that received at their massage school(s). It inspiring to me to learn that i could do this as well someday, and really develop a skill. I can see myself learning from, perhaps, a Shaitsu or Anma master in Japan or perhaps a Tui Na master in Taiwan to really hone my skills and that particular field and, therefore, be able to skillfully offer that service to others.

We insist our leaders work hard, exercise hard, and have private lives that are highly disciplined. Yet this insistence is a dead end. It stops many of the best leaders from leading (because they gay or promiscuous or fat). 
I think a lot of it isn that clients are unwilling to communicate. it that they unable to communicate. No one ever asks about your pain. We might say to a friend, "Oh I slept wrong, my neck got a kink," and the friend will sympathize and then the conversation moves on. But the friend never asks: "Where exactly do you feel that? On a scale of 1 10? When do you notice it? Are any movements or activities more difficult for you now?" It likely clients just don have more information to share, because they don have the language around it, they don know what sort of information we looking for, they not that in tune with their symptoms, and they certainly haven been making mental notes like "Looking to the left is extra hard, gotta make sure I mention that to my massage therapist."
