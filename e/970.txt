If I recall correctly, many seasons of Star Trek: TNG were shot at a harrowing schedule of approximately an episode a week. That sounds rather hurried, but if you note that ST:TNG had seasons with 26 episodes in them, you realize it is an absolutely crazy schedule! Every episode was its own story, and the whole hinted towards a bigger theme but that was about it until the finale came.

In all likelihood, fixed and variable O costs also go up significantly as capacity factor decreases, albeit not linearly. That is because decreasing the load of the nuclear plant or even turning it down to zero does not allow proportional recovery of these costs.

Also there something to be very aware of if you interested. Contrary to their advertisements, they don only make money when you make money. You have to pay a 500 EUR security deposit and fully understand the terms that allow them to take it and revoke your membership. That deposit is returned to you at the completion of your contract, but the advertising is not honest in my opinion. You not simply paying a portion of your winnings, you paying 500 EUR and/or a portion of your winnings. If you are unable to become a winning poker player or if the effort required to do so is not monetarily efficient, you will be stuck for that deposit. They clearly produced winning players and I don have any inside intel on their system, but it something to understand when comparing your options.

Next gen will certainly help take the shackles of BGS. Graphics wise, engine wise (whatever that means) animation wise but one thing that also very important that not many people appreciate is modding wise as well. Brand new engine = a change in code and mechanics for hundreds of modders who help in keeping BGS games alive well beyond their years. Maintaining the same engine and just building on top of it, permits the consistency for modders to keep making content as apposed to them needing to learn new approaches (if they have the time) and potentially limiting what kind of content can be made or how much.

Favorite stretch for the hip flexors is easy to perform without much chance of straining your low back. Before starting the stretch, pull one knee toward your chest to flatten and rotect your lower back. Then extend the other leg and let it hang for at least 2 min. Repeat with the other leg. Another easy hip flexor stretch is to bend one leg at the waist and knee and rest your lower leg on a chair, while allowing the straight leg to gently stretch for 20 min. To reduce pain in your glutes, lay on a tennis ball, bend your knee, and move your knee back and forth (with your heel staying still  see Left).

If you find that you not losing that much weight, have you considered calculating your new TDEE? As we lose weight and grow fitter, our bodies require less and less calories for maintenance.

This isn't really accurate, and I think it's a result of conflating and confusing Marx for Lenin, Stalin or Mao and them with each other. This was mainly due to Communist and anti Communist propaganda, since Communists wanted to say they're inheriting the legacy of their God Emperor Karl Marx (seeing how they talk about him would've disgusted Marx since he hated hero worship) and Anti Communists wanted everything about the ideology discredited.

The Sturgis police arrived on the scene, taking Alice and her girls into custody. As luck would have it, the judge was allegedly a customer of Alice's bagnio and he ruled favorably on them. Even though the identity of the shooter remains unclear, the shooting charges against Alice were dismissed as self defense. However, she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house and the girls were charged with prostitution. Alice paid the fines and her roadhouse was quickly back in business a week later. They continually arrested her well into her 60s. Each time she would pay her fines and then continue business as usual until she was sentenced, at age 75, to a state penitentiary for repeated convictions for being a madam. South Dakota Governor Bulow immediately pardoned her in 1928, knowing he could not send the infamous white haired old lady to prison.

When she finished doing my hair it was poker straight and she said, "Is that good enough to get you out the door"? Out the door?? Did she hear what I said? Her lack of paying attention will cause me to try another hairstylist the next time! Customers get cranky when you don't pay attention and do your best at satisfying their request.

That would of course be an odd thing to do, given that Republicans, who had a 100 year history of opposition to slavery, support for the civil rights of black Americans, efforts to pass anti lynching bills, opposition to Jim Crow laws   efforts to disband the Ku Klux Klan. The GOP even voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act with much larger majorities than Democratics. Why would racists and segregationist Democratics now become Republicans?
There have been LOTS of people who have had these viewpoints throughout history. We ought not be so convinced that people have only began thinking that economic viewpoints like the unfettered free market and unlimited resource extraction might not be the best idea for humanity's long term survival.
Once I stupidly moved in with a guy after only a couple months dating him cause I thought why not. One night I was putting my kid to sleep and I used to lay in bed with him and rub his back or hold his hand so he could fall asleep quick, so I had the door shut and I played on my phone while I layed in there with him. Scrolled Facebook, twitter, etc.

Anyways, by this point all hell has broken loose in the poker room and all of the games have stopped. Everyone is just watching what is unfolding. Apparently, and I don know this to be 100% true, the guy son was standing right next to him. This was pointed out to me by someone who I believe to be totally credible and who is a local who plays in the games almost daily. The "Aria medical team" finally arrives with an AED and they try shocking the guy, but to no avail. Eventually, about 10 minutes after the initial distress call, the paramedics arrive and try shocking him again, also to no avail. At one point during CPR, the guy arm twitched and appeared to move. Everyone promptly started clapping and screaming with joy, although the doctor confirmed after the fact that the patient was not successfully revived and that this was just an involuntary movement. He simply said it did not look good. It took a good 15 minutes after the guy was transported out of the poker room for everyone to return to the table and for the game to resume.

Implicit in this is his desire to send Pranab to Rashtrapati Bhawan, a move that Sonia Gandhi is still uncomfortable with; thus the prime minister would have subtly demonstrated his preference in the coming presidential elections.

Legislators say it's premature to envision Las Vegas in the Everglades. Vegas casino owners, like the proprietors of the Las Vegas Sands, are making pitches to open dazzling resorts in Florida. But whereas gambling like high stakes poker is ubiquitous in Nevada, there are areas of Florida like Orlando, home to Walt Disney World, where Mouseketeers and one armed bandits don't exactly mesh. "The state's just so diverse, so Vegas style scenario is not a natural progression," says state representative Bill Galvano, a Republican from the Gulf Coast who helped lead negotiations with the Seminoles. Adds state representative Jim Waldman, a South Florida Democrat who also took part in the Seminole deal: "I don't think you're going to have another Vegas. What you're going to have are more options for people who want to gamble" in Florida. (See video of poker's arrival in China.)

If you want your best chance of winning money, play poker. In casino style poker, you aren playing against the casino, so the game isn rigged against you (meaning all the players theoretically have the same chance of winning).

HOWEVER I want to discourage you from getting the R nineT scrambler as a first bike. There are a number of reasons it is inappropriate. The first reason is you really shouldn start on a machine with 100HP and 75lb ft of torque, that is enough to get you in a lot of trouble. Second is that without throwing guards on there, the cylinder heads are going to be the first point of contact when you inevitably drop or mishandle. Other common first bikes will get their handlebars or other parts down first before the engine, not this one. They also uncharacteristically raw bikes. They shake and shimmy and have no rider modes or ways of mitigating that power. Heck the model you like doesn even have a tachometer. I also not second guessing your financial situation, but by any measure nearly $14k is A LOT to spend on a first bike.

Most players are usually joking or trying to make a funny comment when it comes to blaming the dealer for a poor hand or bad outcomes. But there are some players who do this in all seriousness. There are even players who actually believe that the dealer is plotting against them. Dealers often abused personally or get cursed at and even get chips cards thrown at them. This is mostly not for doing their job right but simply because the player could not win the pot.

I found this fantastic photograph of the attendees of the meeting of the Astronomische Gesellschaft at Hamburg, August 1913 in the December issue 1913 issue of Popular Astronomy. This is an august group, and of course they not "blank" or "missing" its just a function of some out of context observations on the opaque overlay that serves to identify all of the folks in the massive group photo. (I encountered these numerous times over the years and always have found the Found Art aspect of them interesting and amusing.) The fact of the matter, though, is that there were some very high powered people at this meeting. Offhand I identify Mader, Eddington, Abbott, Mueller, Plassman, Struve, Plaskett, Campbell, Repsold(s), Jansen, Schwarzchild, Backlund, Seeliger, and numerous others. This is probably a general truth, though it is particularly so with journals that cut a broad path in the communication of ideas, and this is certainly the story with the late 17th century journal/magazine, Bibliotheque Universelle. It ran from 1672 to 1726, and the intellectually thirsty editors ran a kind of review/abstract service for their readers they found (mostly) newly published books in a wide variety of areas, and wrote summaries and statements on them, with background history, and the occasional editorial comment. Some of the articles were on significant works by John Locke and Antoine van Leeuwenhoek, but many and probably most were on obscure topics in nitty theological history and mostly invisible philosophical issues, or at at least that is how the latter seems to me today. The Bibliotheque brought new ideas to the continent, and brought them in the Lingua Franca, which also happened to be French.
Your aunt recollection of being "brainwashed" at school is likely accurate: Nazi Germany was a totalitarian regime and used a combination of propaganda and indoctrination to keep the populace pliant and loyal, and schools were required to teach Nazi ideology. I once interviewed an old gent who grown up in that time: a Jesuit priest who had been stationed there used to give him and his classmates "Bible study", but in fact he would ask them what they learned in school that day and proceed to tell them why it was all wrong   this was possible, because the Nazis were at the time leaving the Catholic Church alone.

The Wanderers "Wobbly" struck big time on the fourth as balls going through rather than bad skittling was the cause of us reaching a low total 51 to lose 7 pins. This was quickly put right on the fifth hand as 9's each from Billy Food Chain and a 13 spare from Skipper Hake helped to a 65 hand and regain 8 pins back to now lead by 22. A sixth hand 60 seemed to be a holding hand, but Naps then found some form and hit their highest hand of the night of 70 to pull ten pins and cut our lead to 12.

That doesn mean getting this movie made was easy. An early prospective producer suggested casting a white woman as the lead. Later, the filmmakers turned down a lucrative deal with Netflix to make the film with Warner Bros., which guaranteed it a higher profile release. This mattered, both for fans of Kevin Kwan best selling book series, which inspired the film, and for Asian audiences the world over who have waited decades to see themselves represented onscreen in all their diversity. Hollywood has grown increasingly dependent on Asian financiers and global audiences to turn a profit. Crazy Rich Asians has the potential to revive the romantic comedy genre that has foundered at the box office recently a massive general audience. By representing Asian people so vividly, the film could set a precedent for many more stories like this one to be told. It coming at the right moment. After years of work in the game of Hollywood, Crazy Rich Asians is poised to win.

The book opens with a general introduction to our natural habitats and the different ways animals turned up in New Zealand (I would have loved an illustration showing Gondwanaland and New Zealand breaking away from each other 80 million years ago), and also raises some conservation issues. Where appropriate, each creature is labelled with its Mori name and/or English name (except for the Pukeko which misses out on also being named swamp hen). There is the occasional clunky sentence but on the whole the text is well written. Just a quick glance throws up some fascinating factoids   on page 93 I was interested to find that scientists count insect species to measure the health of our waterways. And now I finally know the names of the sea shells I loved to collect on beach trips as a young nipper. I rarely got to see the creatures that inhabited those familiar shells in the flesh, so this was a cool insight.

Plenty of casinos have their unfavorable slot machines placed near the door, near poker and blackjack tables and these are machines that you have to stay away from.

Live hard drive and memory snapshots of blinking, powered on machines in a network reveal significantly more forensic data than some powered off server removed from a network. It's the difference between watching a house over time, carefully noting down who comes and goes and when and how, versus handing over a key to a lonely boarded up building. By physically handing over a server to the FBI as Trump suggested, the DNC would in fact have destroyed evidence. 
I think cats are a little more independent and not willing to put up with bullshit, which means that if they not in a home with the right energy for their needs they kinda just do their own thing. And I think those tendencies make people think cats are assholes if they in that kind of environment. Just my 2 cents on the topic.

Or maybe not so bewildering. Bill de Blasio esteems himself to a degree not remotely commensurate with his accomplishments.

As a beekeeper who has a top bar hive and a langstroth hive,I have to say the only thing I disagree with is the queen excluder. It is so much easier managing the hive with the queen excluder. The top bar hive is a dog breakfast at times given the bees have free range. Of course the hive is designed to not be opened by humans, if they were left to their own devices and never opened it would of course work perfectly fine for them.

It is measurable and quantifiable, although always with some error. The finite speed of light means we get to see a history of the expansion of the whole universe. We can measure how much light has been stretched by the expansion of the universe, and if we can measure the distance to each light source, and look at a lot of light sources at different distances, that gives us a nice measurable track of the expansion over the whole history of the universe. what you think the Hubble constant is (is it 68 km/s/Mpc or 73 km/s/Mpc ?).

While yes, the genocide was a military operation, not civilian, ASSK could have publically condemned it. Instead she stuck to the official narrative and denied the whole thing. Why?

Sorry, but regardless of the rest of his behavior or your time working at the country club, that specific interaction was not sexism or condescension. He still very much a creep, but he was not being condescending or sexist. The sexism started even before this particular comment. The comment was just another straw. Sure, your explanation might apply in another situation, where that the only thing out of the ordinary that happens. But not in this case. Also, "cordial old ladies" can be sexist, too. For example, both men and women of older generations are likely to shame a woman who enjoys a healthy sex life while expecting or encouraging young men to have one without consequence. Grandma and Grandpa were raised with much more rigid expectations of age and gender roles. It wouldn surprise me if "Cordial Old Lady" expected a young male server to be brighter than a young female one. There may also be elements of classism and ageism that went into the guy comment, but in this scenario definitely sexism, too. He even made a point of saying "beauty AND brains" as if it surprising or impressive she have both. Do you honestly think he would have said "handsome AND smart" to a young man?

The resolution is destined to pass the House, where the Democrats hold a majority, and probably will clear the GOP controlled Senate in coming weeks. But it's unlikely to get enough support in either chamber to override a promised veto by Trump.With the votes, both parties will be staking out ground on what's likely to be one of the more divisive issues in the 2020 election, while also highlighting a power struggle that's been brewing for years between Congress and the White House over how much control a gridlocked legislature should cede to the executive branch.It also sets the tone for the next two years of divided government, putting congressional Republicans in the uncomfortable position of opposing their president or defending unilateral White House action they sharply criticized in the Obama administration.Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Tuesday she will support the resolution, putting the Democrats within one GOP vote of the number needed to pass the resolution in that chamber if all Democrats and independents vote yes.Murkowski said that with the emergency declaration, Trump "is overstepping into the legislative prerogative. We as legislators need to be concerned."Trump declared a national emergency in a Rose Garden speech on Feb.

This is generally fine because you can use the unwanted unit to get dragonflowers, you can HM farm them to get up to 5000 feathers, and you can give their skills to another unit.

It still has the higher BST gives a better score, so armors still dominate the top tiers (in particular the three trainee armored dragons, L!Tiki, H!Myrhh and W!Fae which have 183 BST, the highest amount), +10 units keep giving a higher score, and there the whole Legendary + blessings thing that ups the score as well, but since now the kills done with bonus units give bonus points, the meta changed to 3 support units + the bonus units.
