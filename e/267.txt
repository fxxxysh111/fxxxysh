Science is about explaining things. From the GPS in our phones to cross breeding corn to make it disease resistant (saving millions of live in the developing world), science is only true to the extent that it actually works. Just look at the amazing technology, medicine and abundance of food that surrounds us. Is each enabled by a magical imp or fairy inside or perhaps a magical incantation? Each benefit we enjoy is reinforcing evidence that in general, and over time, science works. From atomic structure to the speed of light, there are simple garage experiments anyone can do to explore these properties and verify that the explanations we have continue to work in actual practice. It also delightful the degree to which the practice of science is democratized. Citizen scientists continue to make new discoveries and overturn existing paradigms with new observations from their basements, garages and backyards.

I mean I agree things are definitely heightened/exaggerated but I always saw it as being staged as a tragic melodrama, as many Darren Aronofsky movies are (the first sounds of the film are a symphony warming up, as if you were in a theater about to watch some operatic performance). The theme of the film is not "drugs are bad" but how addiction and the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream can get tangled and lead to one's self destruction, in this case it's characters using drugs to obtain that goal. So objectively yes, drugs like opiates and uppers can be very bad for you, people have gotten infections from using dirty needles, whored themselves out to maintain an expensive drug habit, get jailed for holding drugs, and have died/been irreparably damaged from legal drugs. I never got the sense that the movie was saying "try drugs once and you'll die" but saw it more as using all the tools of the medium of film to depict a tragedy of people who have good intentions but continue down a path that will inevitably lead to their own annihilation (a common theme of Aronofsky's movies).

Also, in Wespe, the single "s" is pronounced like an English "s", not like an English "z". This is because the "s" is at the end of a syllable.

When an "s" begins a syllable (singen, lesen, so), it is pronounced like the English "z"; when it ends a syllable, it is pronounced like the English "s".

I know of several very good ward organists who have found themselves with a music director who doesn understand the importance of tempo and energy and not gasping for air and will purposely go slow in order to be "reverent." I know of other directors who begin to tire through the hymn, and so the beat pattern gets slower and slower (usually because amateur directors tend to make big, swoopy motions that are way more work than is needed). Good organists are trained to follow the director no matter what. If the organist follows slow leadership, and the congregation follows the organ instinctively, everyone goes over the cliff together.

An investigation ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki into Blackwater's September 16 shooting in Baghdad, in which 17 civilians were killed and another 24 were wounded, has determined that the company's operators opened fired indiscriminately and without provocation. government pay $8 million in compensation to each of the victims' families and sever all Iraq based contracts with Blackwater within the next 6 months. government will comply and perhaps even more unclear if it could meet the Iraqi government's demands even if it wanted to. Civilian employees of the State Department rely on Blackwater for protection. diplomatic operations would be paralyzed, at least until another private contractor could be hired for the job. Even if this were to happen, it's doubtful that booting Blackwater would make much difference. More than likely, its operators would quickly find work with competitors like Triple Canopy and DynCorp, who would have to fill the Baghdad security void in Blackwater's absence. The private security sector is a small one after all. Even Andrew Moonen, the Blackwater operator who got drunk in the Green Zone last Christmas Eve and murdered one of the Iraqi vice president's security guards, found a new job with Combat Support Services Associates, which put him back to work in Kuwait just two months after the shooting.

And then it gets down to him in the SB and some MAWG in the BB and you can probably already guess what happened. BB asked to chop, the new player looked clueless and called the $3. BB asks again, this time more forcefully. Dealer explains what chopping is to the new player, new player says no let play. BB visually disgusted checks. It checks all the way to the river, SB bets $5, BB folds 93o face up and says "you really want my $3 that bad you can have it". A few other shitregs chime in, more politely albeit, and tell the new player that you are supposed to chop when it gets to the blinds, it just wastes time, only play if you have a bad beat hand, all the typical bullshit, and it all going straight over the new player head.

In a very real sense, it is very much like taste or smell, in that the cells of your immune system follow chemical gradients and signals to detect and locate invaders. All the cells of your body are covered in glyco proteins (complex patterns of sugar molecules attached to protein molecules anchored to the cell membranes) and every immune cell in your body is tested during their development to ensure none of the combinations of exposed glyco proteins on the cell surface trigger them to initiate an immune response. If they fail that test they are instructed to kill themselves. In that wall all the successful immune cells remain sensitive to chemicals that don match "self" Invading pathogens are covered in these types of chemical triggers. Whether they release chemical gradients that our immune cells directly follow, or if they are recognized and coated with antibodies specific to them which are then recognized by immune cells, its all chemistry.

I mainly play the game on my Go. I tried the Rift version but the other players in game had extremely jerky animations.

HOWEVER I want to discourage you from getting the R nineT scrambler as a first bike. There are a number of reasons it is inappropriate. The first reason is you really shouldn start on a machine with 100HP and 75lb ft of torque, that is enough to get you in a lot of trouble. Second is that without throwing guards on there, the cylinder heads are going to be the first point of contact when you inevitably drop or mishandle. Other common first bikes will get their handlebars or other parts down first before the engine, not this one. They also uncharacteristically raw bikes. They shake and shimmy and have no rider modes or ways of mitigating that power. Heck the model you like doesn even have a tachometer. I also not second guessing your financial situation, but by any measure nearly $14k is A LOT to spend on a first bike.

I work at a methadone clinic and have seen many people taper off methadone. The whole modality has flaws, but getting off is 100% possible. I think it really common for people to hit a wall while tapering, where they trucking along and cutting 100mg off their dose 5mg at a time for a long while and then all of a sudden it like the brain picks up on what happening and goes, "NAH." I always warn people it coming and recommend they go back up to the dose they last felt normal at and hang out there for at least 1 month, and then drop 2mg and see how they feel. If all is well, keep dropping 2mg every 2 weeks, and increase the mgs you drop as you feel able to. But if you have a 36 hour half life of your medication, it bears out math wise that your dose has leveled out after 14 days and you ready to drop again.

I glad she ended up with Bertie because I think they were the most equally matched of any of her love interests. When LE organized a search for Jayme Closs, they were very clear that no one but LE was allowed to touch anything. Personally, I don think BG left much if any DNA; he was comfortable walking down a public path after the murders, clearly he wasn covered in blood or signs of flighting. Therefore, I think it entirely possible the searchers could have contaminated DNA left by BG. I really, really hope they have something useful but the odds are bad right now. Hopefully improvements in DNA technology will solve this soon.

The tensions that the police ops in Lyari are instigating are dangerous and widespread. They go far beyond the problems of urban decay, or ethnic ghettoisation in Karachi. The majority of Lyari is Sindhi and Baloch. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a cheap and easy route to the hearts and minds in the Sindhi countryside is through blood in Lyari. Claiming victimhood in Lyari will resonate with Sindhis across the province. This is an exceptionally opportune thing. It isn't every day that Sindhis get a headline in discussions about Karachi.

You could think of that cost   like the cost of cleaning up the Pinewood dump   as the price we have to pay for long gone state leaders who were looking out for their friends rather than the natural environment that they were entrusted to protect.

Let me tell you, u/anon2777 why I play poker. It's not the moment when that board runs out just so clean. It's not the A that came on the turn or the Q that fell on the river. 
The commercial has an idyllic beginning, with a pleasant voiceover informing audiences that "it's morning again in America." Soon enough, though, the good cheer melts away, replaced by a sinister vibe typical of the dystopian drama set in Massachusetts.
Sex is a natural part of life so if those people should end up pregnant, they should be forced to carry a baby they do not want? The arguement is hey there is adoption. Yes, and millions of children end up in foster care; the system can barely support these unwanted children. I personally do not think people should use abortion as birth control but I don know if thats much of a problem. 
The moment I checked into the hotel, I accessed the Net for some dress code advice for big time gambling. Should it be a tuxedo? Should it be a business jacket?

I'm absolutely not advocating for any sort of purposeful genetic selection in humans, but god we could use more gingers. I adore red hair, I know the stereotype of ginger men is supposed to be pasty, specky, and overall undesirable, but honestly I'd say 3/4 of ginger men who I've met/noticed, if not more, are so handsome holy crap. Ginger girls are beautiful too, I have the biggest soft spot for red hair, and I'm sad the closest i can ever get to it is through dye. 
The MTX there had nothing to do with power levels, but the lack of a grind had people hating the game.It not an easy balance. You want people to climb in power, but you need to balance it between "so fast that people are done in weeks and get bored" and "so slow nobody feels it worth it". Destiny 1 felt, for many people, too much on the "grind" side with godrolls and the like (though some players really loved this!), and when Bungie tried to reverse this in Destiny 2 people hit the gear cap in a month and quit.I think it pretty disingenuous to compare this to F2P mechanics, too.

I would suggest site probably doesn't matter much, and I don't believe any of the big ones to be rigged. My advice, play less sit and gos, but at a higher buy ins. I play a lot at Party and the "randomness of play" really flattens out the higher you go dollar wise.

One of the worst feelings I experienced is when a cis woman asked if I was trans. I was like, "Yes I aware I look kind of masculine thank you for pointing that out." It felt approximately like being misgendered but with the added discomfort of a cis person wanting to talk about my transition. She was even supportive, but started with reminding me that I look. different.
Others asked which operation. I did not name it as I wanted to focus on what this thread was about: the perception of hero" on the one side and asshole" on the other.

The customer inserts bills ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred into the device which then spits out a card, basically an in house gambling debit card; losses are deducted and wins credited automatically. No nickels have to be pumped in or collected in an old coffee cup. The handing over of money by the gambler to the house is a quick, quiet, private matter. Paper currency appears then disappears, silently and without fanfare.
The obvious double standard that Jesus taught was the difference between good and evil. You're just looking in the mirror And seeing yourself when you look at me. When a woman turns someone down at the bar, they should take it as their cue to leave. A Socio Neurological Perspective It can be reasonably argued that the larger cultural norms and traditions foster the disrespecting of women. All you need to do is to Turn back the words you say to me And say them to yourself To know the truth. If I were running The View, I'd fire Rosie. When the child repeatedly sasses, negates, and disobeys his Mom, does that mirror behaviors modeled within the family and culture , or is that more a cause of future behaviors generalized to social style and perpetuating the disrespect foisted upon women? Listen to, understand, and try to help the situation. This has been shown over many decades with many thousands of individuals. At 8:00 pm, Pamela's doorbell rings.

Why do you refuse to acknowledge their victimhood?
It all fell apart from me around the time Government Plates came out. Speaking generally, pretty much every track around that time of their discography just came and went, nothing grabbed my attention once i got over the fact that they just wanted to make their music sound as loud as possible.

I'll let you in on a secret. The second amendment is dead if we can't move it out of the partisan sphere of politics. If our plan for keeping our rights is to ensure no progressives or liberals (like myself) ever hold power, then we will lose them.

As such, rhetoric such as yours does nothing but harm the long term prospects for our right to individual self defense.

Is an issue at other times as well; like during weekdays often bus routes from the same area will run within a 10 minutes of each other rather than spreading out the times for more time coverage. So again, if you miss one, you basically miss them all and have to wait 30 minutes for the next.
American football is a more physical sort of game, and hence, all of them are created equally, both in terms of the sewing and the design itself.

Poker is a hobby. You play poker. Doing tricks with a yo yo is a hobby. Maybe someone tells you "you are so amazing at yo yo tricks, really incredible", then you go to a trick competition and win and just keep winning until you can really justify going to work as it will have too high an opportunity cost to make sense. Since the yo yo money is less stable/secure, you want to factor that in and create a comparable risk adjusted income, so minimum 2 3x current income.
