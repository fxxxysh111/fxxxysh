Add to this the arresting of an occasional roisterer or pickpocket, the racket of the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom, or the enthusiast who plunges into the swimming tank with unconscionable noise and splashing. Besides all those whose voices, if nothing else, are good, imagine the armpit plucker with his penetrating, shrill voice,   for purposes of advertisement,   continually giving it vent and never holding his tongue except when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim yell instead. Then the cakeseller with his varied cries, the sausageman, the confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each with his own distinctive intonation.
Every once in a great while, the sorts of arguments that motivate academic life, like how we know what we know, will spill out into the everyday world of politics and culture. Such is the case with the confirmation hearings of Sonia Sotomayor.

They are advocating to not give advice, hence the mods saying "this is not an advice sub".

They found that the GRU officers secretly surveiled an empoyee of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee all day in real time, including spying on "her individual banking information and other personal topics." They showed that "Guccifer 2.0," the supposed lone hacker behind the DNC hack, was in fact managed by a specific GRU unit, and even reconstructed the internet searches made within that unit while a GRU officer with shoddy English skills was drafting the first post as Guccifer 2.0.

I absolutely regretted not 3 betting flop the second I chose to flat, if nothing else to get a better idea where I was. I knew it was a mistake the second I did. I figured at best I'm chopping, at worst he has Q8, KQ (as aggressive as he was KQ could/should have been a 3bet pre?) or some combo of a pair/two pair that backed into the flush. He has very few bluffs here, and a considering his stack size at zoom with a Max buy in $25 I didn't believe he was a maniac.
The first thing that you should do in order to learn about the used casino poker chips that you have is to carefully observe the colors and the artwork that is contained on the chip. In most instances, a casino will implement the use of very specific artwork and a unique selection of colors in order to indicate that the particular chip belongs to their casino. You should observe these types of identifiers and they will be able to help you identify where the chips originated.

You repeatedly claimed he owes his fans everything. Which is such a backwards way of thinking. You thinking he owes you the fan anything is narcissistic behaviour. He wrote books, people bought those books. After that the transaction is completed. It not his fault that people has got so emotionally attached to his work that they feel like it belongs to them, it simply doesn owes himself for his success. People liking his work is not a result of people being kind to him but him being good at what he does.

That part of a short (12pp) and stiff little report from President James Monroe asking if Indians of all sorts did indeed have title to their lands within the United States, which means, I guess, that this was really a question in 1822. The number of treaties and the number of treaties with the Indian Nations abrogated and annulled, it still didn set me up for this basic question, which really surprised me. A few years earlier) to, well, somewhere else this occurred in 1819, when the Indians succumbed and were forced to live in central ish Florida.

I have this hypothesis that much of that happens because the typical "logic bro" idols are like, the first people to really show said logic bros that they can think through things in a systematic fashion. Lots of young logic bros seem to have been in very religious households, or just in situations where they were never really taught logic in a formal setting. So it kind of feels like they giving you a superpower, which is consistent with the behaviour that follows from that.

So why exactly does the yield curve turn on its head? This gets to the self fulfilling prophecy part. Bond prices and yields fluctuate according to investor demand. When more investors and companies want to buy long term bonds, the price goes up and the yield goes down.

I've been asked a few times this week about the source of the materials that I write about. The overwhelming majority of the books and pamphlets are right here, in my store or warehouse (see the above link for the science bookstore), so I see allot of this stuff everyday, currency of the realm and all that. Most of the odd things that are found in my blog flagpole painting, zipper repair, finding England in the Great Pyramid, building the Great Pyramid in Detroit, and so on) have come to me via the Library of Congress, where for many years I managed to purchase/trade for bits and pieces of their surplus. One large purchase in particular from the LC the 90,000 item "Pamphlet Collection has provided thousands of the sublime mundane, naive surreal masterpieces that I've found so irresistible. Most of this material hasn't found a place in my store, which as you now know specializes in classics in modern physics and mathematics, but I do hope to be able to place them as a collection at some dim point in the future. I would love to generate a few books out of them, and I think that a choice 500 of them or so would make a tremendous show somewhere (Brooklyn?) as a Found Art, Unexpected Dadaist, The Surprise of the Naive Surreal, show or some such thing, showing a marriage of design, outsider intellect and sublime mundane. There are at the very least several thousands of these things from the Pamphlet Collection that are gorgeous and so unexpected, that are such intellectual (or non intellectual) surprises, that they would (I think) make for a bang up show.

But how, and why, did the messiness of sex and gender get tangled up with "gays"? For that, we had to wait for the Victorian sexologists, and their notion that homosexuality was a form of gender inversion (manly women, feminine men) that was written on the body as a lack of sexual dimorphism.

If you mismanage degenerative tendinopathy in an NBA athlete, especially quadriceps tendinosis, you can have very bad things happen. An example of this is Blake Griffin. The quad injury that kept Blake sidelined the majority of the 2015 2016 season and playoffs was degenerative tendinopathy of the quadriceps that was mismanaged and led to a partial rupture of the quadriceps tendon. Even with rehabbing this injury, Blake has lost some of his explosiveness and is still at very high risk to re injure that tendon.
Sometimes you will be in a hand at the river against two opponents while you have the best low hand and they are both raising. It is extremely likely that you will be quartered in this situation, and you must decide if there is enough money already in the pot to warrant calling all of the raises. Against two opponents, if you have a low and it is quartered, every dollar you put into the pot will return only 75 cents to you..

Unambiguous sincerity is beyond Reynolds range as an actor, and Fleck and Boden use this to keep us guessing: is Curtis running a long con, or could he be motivated by genuine friendship?Though set in the present, the film has a deliberate retro flavour, with a blues soundtrack and frequent allusions to 20th century popular culture (Gerry imagines himself dressing up in a white suit, like the 1970s country legend Glen Campbell).Softer and sweeter than these forerunners, the film is basically a chaste romance between the two men, with the gentle pace allowing ample time to dwell on their fond amusement at each other; women are marginal, including Sienna Miller in a typically thankless "girlfriend" role.

Professionals and casinos use clay and ceramic chips. Ceramic chips are good for customisation. For clay chips I would go for Paulson chips   they are the best. For custom chips, use ceramic chips, they feel good, durable and last a lifetime. You can print any design on them. Avoid companies that require you to submit your own image unless you are good with graphics (adobe illustrator). (Full Answer)

In order to continue moving up, you can risk more money, but the win rate may not necessarily reflect your increased risk. The game gets tougher and tougher.

Another example, as given by a person who was character disordered in the past, was were the person had a verbal agreement to do some freelance work for someone, they agreed on an initial price, but nothing was put in writing or signed, so half way through the work, the character ordered person decided they wanted to be paid a higher price and there was nothing the other person could do in this case, because they really needed the work done and realized after the fact, they didn't have a signed deal.4)YEAH, YEAH, WE WILL DISCUSS THAT LATER SYNDROMESimilar to the optimist sign, you will often hear the character disordered person say "Yeah, Yeah, we will talk about that later."

Let me be clear: one side and one side only has poisoned the well. The Democrats have tried, for decades, to play the game in good faith.

Wait for the big blind (The big blind is the largest forced bet at the beginning of a game designed to stimulate betting. The player who has to contribute the big blind rotates one position to the left after each game.) to get to you before playing. Use this time to watch your opponents, and get a feel for the way they are playing. This is not required, but if the dealer is doing a competent job, you should tip. Dealers are like waitstaff in that they make most of their money from tips. A sample plan would be to tip the dealer .50 on average size pots and possibly $1.00 on larger pots if the dealer is doing a good job. Also, you can watch what the other players are tipping to get an idea. Remember though that every dollar that goes to the dealer is reducing your winnings. Never act before your turn. This is very poor etiquette and can change the outcome of a hand. If you leave your cards unprotected, the dealer might muck them (mix with discards) by mistake, and there is no way you can retrieve them. Let the dealer push the pot to you. If the dealer makes a mistake, it can often be corrected. Place all bets in front of you, and let the dealer pull them into the pot.

Wristy Essex pair Tom Westley and Dan Lawrence use county matches as a battleground for deciding who's most adept at hitting the ball through the leg side. Whenever impetuous 19 year old Lawrence arrives at the crease to join his No.3, the former invariably suggests a "flick off" before both proceed to pepper the mid wicket boundary. Judging by their 2016 run records, the game hasn't either any harm..

Of why your MIL wants to run you off may be that she finds something about you to be very intimidating. It could be something very innocuous. She could be comparing herself to you and coming up short in her own mind, or could be fearful that you would take away her control of her son. These other women and the girlfriend may seem more controllable by comparison and therefore "better." Her better treatment of the girlfriend could also partially be aimed at making you feel insecure and therefore more controllable or simply encouraging you to leave.

The emphasis on the personal even as news was depoliticized makes it impossible to say that the New York Times is "real" and the Enquirer is "gossip." Enquirer is unabashedly about the personal; the Times tries to maintain a veneer of the fourth estate about it. The actual line between "real" journalism and tabloids has become so blurry that it can no longer be discerned..

Another reason for this to exist is that many modern stairwells are designed to be safe routes of egress from fire. If you are mobility impaired, this button enables you to access the landing inside the stairwell and wait there for assistance in getting down the stairs. In the event of fire, making it to the stairwell could give you at least 30 extra minutes to escape. So yeah, having a button that helps a disabled person reach the relative safety of the stairwell is a good idea, even if that person cannot use the stairs themselves.

I understand the controversy around fasting. I'm using the OMAD right now because I'm with you, I prefer not to calorie count. (If my schedule worked with lifting, I'd be down with calorie counting because I believe muscle gain has to be fueled properly.) But I don't talk about it because I want to model good eating habits for my kids, and OMAD and its cousin fasting are not in anyway presentable as healthy for healthy weight minors.

Eventually, the father started talking to us. I don't think we ever got his name but the son's name was Will. We talked about a bunch of random stuff, and the kids were so nice, too. At some point, Dan mentioned how well behaved they were compared to the other kids and the guy said, "there are no bad dogs, just bad owners." His kids guessed how old we were and also where we were from. They were just a really nice family. They were from Wisconsin.

But the evidence isn't there, the data supports vaccines on nearly every scientific and logical level. When I presented sources that WERE scientific and reliable like the CDC taking numerous studies and concluding vaccines don't cause autism, those were dismissed as big pharma governmental schemes. So at that point I knew there was a strong likelihood my mom was deeply misinformed and I'd have to make this decision without her immediate support.

In some ways this book represented Cheever going far afield from the suburbs where he had made his name.

The gentleman shows up, and we have a little chat about the bike and why I was selling it. I told him that we needed to find a vehicle that would transport five people, three of which would be in car seats, and how buy here pay here was looking to be our only option. He asked a very strange question, "do you have a pediatrician for your children?" This threw me off, but I answered that since we had recently went on State insurance, most pediatrician offices were not excepting patients with that coverage. He then pulls out his wallet, hand me the full $260 stating that he felt really bad for talking me down, and then hands me his business card. He was indeed a pediatrician from one of the most respectable pediatric offices in our area. He promised (and followed through) that he could get my kids accepted as patients. But he went one step further in a way that blew my mind.

Crocs are cute in a WTF is on your clown feet kinda way but camp shoes are another myth. y'dont need em. if you need to trot out to the privy and your feet are in agony, the crocks arent any less agony. plop your bare miserable feet into those cold wet hard hikers, go do your business, and get back to being barefoot as soon as you can. On the subject of feet, a word about shoes. theyre your feet and you know best but do you really need ankle support (another myth) Anything less than a rigid ski boot isnt actually providing any ankle support. its all in your head (someone just had a coronary from reading that). You will have to walk through water and you shouldnt do that barefoot. on the other hand, heavy boots are overkill too. most hikers have opted for trail running shoes with the idea that theyll walk their feet dry (im one of them). The thing is, most trail runners have soles that are a lot thinner and softer than boots and you need to give that some serious thought. there are MANY MANY MANY sections of ankle breaking toe jamming arch splitting rock fields where walking in trail runners can truly be a painful experience. Consider what you need, what you want, and what you dont need. in ME NH i was ever so glad to have Keen Targhees but by VT i really appreciated the Altra Lone Peak trail runners. Its a matter of compromises and knowing your feet to find whats best for you.

You may think these women are greedy or stupid to take on debt, often with interest rates approaching 30%, to reshape their bodies. But they not. In fact, they are rational economic actors who understand that looking "better" really can lead to more success in the job market and the romance market.

I probably worded wrong. Instead of betting large with a capped range meaning we can bet on certain dangerous turns, we can bet small and more often with an uncapped range even on dangerous turns. Probably why I can teach it because I can fully grasp and regurgitate it easily.

They all have talent/physical ability, otherwise they wouldn have made names for themselves at the level before. What important, especially when you trying to call the next star, is looking for players that have "it." "It" is hard to explain, but I generally be described as the ability to go out and win in big pressure.

It would seem like the spa would have balanced rules, like requiring a parent/guardian/approved person to over 16 to supervise but then whatever, or even just having a "girls with women, boys with men" policy, or having the parent sign off on acceptable genders for their kid therapist. For instance, employee dress codes are a frequently cited case of legal sex discrimination, in the sense that the law does discriminate between men and women, but the law does not harm either and is merely intended to specify dress restrictions or requirements. 
Variety is the spice of (your sex) life. You need to see each situation that pops up and ask yourself, is there an opportunity to make something out of this? And you can start Superbowl Sunday! You know the old saying, when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade? Well, same idea here, but it's when life hands you the Superbowl, you make SUPERSEX. The idea is you and your man are going to make little wagers on the game or things surrounding the game.

The credit for this ingeniously choreographed Bollywood style venture goes entirely to Narendra Modi, who from the very first day after assuming his office has been in the driver's seat, not only controlling the 'temperature' in Islamabad by keeping it constantly in a 'reactive' rather than 'active' mode but also managing almost every development in India Pakistan relations. Modi is a master of creating illusions that only a seasoned chess player would make against an amateur rival.

"Surrogacy is the new adoption," says Delhi fertility doctor Anoop Gupta.Similar surrogacy tourism is happening around the world, in the and even in rural, white areas in the US like the one where I work, poor women carry the children of the urban upper classes in exchange for $8 10,000.Again, what if the situation were reversed? if science showed what many of us suspect to be true: the upper classes, like purebred dogs, are more prone to neuroses and even, perhaps, psychoses as well as a host of rich peoples diseases like gluten intolerance? if rich women were forced to be the surrogates for poor women so the poor women could continue to work and then the poor women would raise the child in the seemingly healthier environment of knowing that life is not about "happiness" and the project of eternal youth?So now we have heterosexual couples with money renting the wombs of poor women so they can have the full rights and benefits of being married and, perhaps more importantly, reproductive.But if modern love says reproductive and married is good, it does not think that reproductive and married is good if it same sex. Why, up until now, same sex couples  even when reproductive and married  have often been denied the right to be with their partners in the hospital.Listing the usual litany of heart breaking stories of partners denied access as their loved ones die, the Obama administration is now demanding that any hospital receiving Medicaid/Medicare funding MUST not discriminate against anyone on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.Again, if the situation were reversed and straight couples were denied visitation rights, most people would see that things need to change. 
Now, onto the kids. Davis looks exciting. I would love to see some speed from these Giants teams and he certainly brings it. 
To Kasich, this kind of crazy Hobbesianism would "hurt small business", which presumably includes the particular lunatic who had done jail time for illegal possession of firearms and was cited multiple times for animal abuse   but still had his Animal Farm up and running in Ohio   until he granted his boarders amnesty. Because of the anti regulation zealots who have taken control of our political culture and institutions, this was the profile of someone still fit to continue to lord over a coterie of dangerous and endangered species, in his own little Jurassic Park.

But still, I don understand why you removed him as mod when the admins specifically requested you not do that. If you busy and didn see the admin message, I guess that makes sense, kind of, except seeing a new mod that you didn add yourself should been a clue that he was added by an admin. I could understand if you thought it was a hacking attempt or something, except he made a post explaining exactly what was happening, and if you really have an alt account that participates here, then you already would have known what happened and that it wasn anything malicious.

In 2016, Kavanaugh reported credit card and personal loan debts of between $60,000 and $200,000. The Trump White House said these debts were the result ofKavanaugh buying baseball tickets for friends who later paid him back, as well as some spending on home improvements. The 2016 debts did not appear on Kavanaugh's 2017 disclosure form because they were either entirely paid off or fell below the reporting threshold. Kavanaugh also reported between $60,000 and $200,000 in debt in 2006.

No new fully autos or burst cannot be bought anywhere in the us unless you're law enforcement or have a class 7 firearms license which is to make them to sell to military or law enforcement. The federal law is pre 1986 with the 6month+ wait, fingerprints and $200 tax stamp. Some states go further and just outright ban the pre 1986 ones. Washington state has a law that says if you owned it before 1996 I think you can keep it but no more can be transferred if you live in Washington state and can't go buy them elsewhere and bring them back. We do have a lot of firearm laws in the us people just like to pretend we don't and say we need to ban them.

Don't think just because you cannot smell it, your cat cannot as well. The best way to ensure you are treating every spot is to treat as you find them (thoroughly, thoroughly, thoroughly soak the areas, repeat as needed until you definitely feel the areas are clean), go through your house in the dark with a true ultraviolet light (Wood's Lamp) to find markings you might have missed (these will florescence under the ultraviolet light), and crawl around at your cat's level to smell for yourself. It is amazing what you will smell at a cat's height versus your own..

And those other people are not, of course, as fully human as "people like us." And so debating whether homosexuals should be executed becomes "good journalism." If the journalists at the BBC had stopped for a moment and asked "If I were queer, would I ask this question? How would it feel to be queer and know that if I lived in Uganda I could be killed for loving someone else?" then they know that killing people for the gender of the people they love is no different than killing people for the color of their skin or their religion. It not really up for debate. Ever.A much better journalistic exercise would be to ask readers whether they knew there are strong connections between American evangelical Christians and the Ugandan debate over executing homosexuals.So the BBC World Services had this excellent idea for a public debate.

Drinking regular milk will not only give kittens diarrhea, but will also cause them to slowly starve to death if their diet isn't properly supplemented [source: Kitten Rescue].
