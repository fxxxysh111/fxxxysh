When you use plastic poker playing cards for building card houses, you can easily enjoy sharing your past time with other family members.

Not far from Fairfield RSL is an unassuming looking hotel called El Cortez, which shares a name with an old school off strip Vegas casino. It doesn't look like much when you walk in: carpets, canteen style seating, a smattering of people buying $6 schooners. Through a set of doors, however, is another world   the so called Dragons Den, where a glittering chandelier hangs over another, sleeker bar and waitresses carry trays full of drinks. 
Your brain doesn't forget the bad choices you've made in the past, either (say, playing the hand that lost you the game). It keeps emotional memories from these experiences and uses them as the background for future decisions. But these memories can lead to flaws in judgment. For instance, studies suggest that the end of an experience has more influence on our memories than the overall experience. When asked which experiment they'd like to repeat, study subjects chose a long, unpleasant experience with a more pleasant ending than a shorter unpleasant experience that didn't have an uptick at the end.
"Each country's style reflects their mentality in a lot of ways, which I thought was astounding. China was graceful, thoughtful   not really a violent art. The Korean people were the most peaceful, calm, kind people I've ever met as a whole, and their art really reflects that.

You calculate the statistical probability of dying in a plane crash in the same way that you calculate the probability of anything else. You simply divide the number of expected outcomes by the number of possible outcomes. You can aggregate this anyway you want, over whatever period of time you want, so long as you properly state the conditions under which you perform your calculation.

No. The three of a kind (3 queens) beats a pair (2 kings). This rule takes precedence. The situation where the kings have a higher value than queens, would become important if you had the same type of hand (like 2 kings vs 2 queens, or 3 kings vs 3 queens). So look at the highest card after the pair, if player A has highest card 10 and player B has highest card King, then player B (the one with the King) wins. But if player A's hand is a pair of 6's and player B's hand is a pair of 5's, then it doesn't matter what the other cards are   the pair of 6's wins. (Full Answer)

"In this day and age, people have taken to tying up a paper banner, giving everyone a plastic lei and putting a drink in a tiki mug and saying that this is tiki," he said. "But tiki is the [restaurant's] soundtrack, which we have collaborated with [DJ and curator] Brother Cleve; it's the design, the food, the drinks, it's all that stuff. Tiki drinks are the work of someone's hand who is very deftly weaving together a myriad of ingredients to make something greater than the sum of its parts. And to make something taste like something you've never tasted before, or something that's exotic and that's going to spark your palate or make you question what's in your glass. That's what we're aiming to do   we're aiming to bring that level of tiki and that thought and attention to detail into the Boston culture."
If gasket came in a flat package then you probably wont have much trouble but if it came in a ball shoved in a box, then you'll have to do each bolt in a star shaped pattern to keep gasket lined up.

The climactic throwdown goes like this: Bond sits at the poker table just as the dealer announces the big blind (mandatory bet) as $1 million.

That lawsuit filed in California on 26 April 2016 was dismissed over technical filing errors (the address listed in court documents was a foreclosed home that has been vacant since its owner died), with the plaintiff failing in her attempt to avoid incurring the cost of the litigation:"Johnson" had previously filed forms asking to be let off the hook for the costs of the lawsuit, claiming she had only $300 to her name  such an allowance   known as in forma paupers   is only given in civil rights cases in California, and the judge ruled that she "failed to state a claim for relief" on a civil rights basis, even though she "utilized the form provided by the Central District of California for civil actions.""Even construing the  pleading liberally, Plaintiff has not alleged any race based or class based animus against her, and consequently, her  allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted," the judge wrote  the address listed on the paperwork leads to an abandoned property, and the phone number goes straight to voicemail.For his part, Trump asserted that the charges were "not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated," adding that "There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. 
I chose Green Finch and Linnet Bird by world renown composer Stephen Sondheim mostly because I was fascinated by its two most common stylistic interpretations. Within the realm of the musical, you can interpret the song assuming Johanna has already lost her mind, leading to a much stronger, more manic illustration, or you can interpret the piece assuming that Johanna is still sane. The second interpretation leads to a more somber, almost melancholy sound, adding an underlying sense of longing to the end of each phrase. 
Same thing goes for learning the second moves now. 75k is a joke, and 100k is downright insulting.

If you want your best chance of winning money, play poker. In casino style poker, you aren playing against the casino, so the game isn rigged against you (meaning all the players theoretically have the same chance of winning). The casino makes it revenue from poker by taking a rake (a small percentage of every pot) so no one at the table has an inherent advantage over another.

NTA. Look, I know these words might sound harsh to say out loud, but it how you feel. This is a common theme for families with a disabled child whose siblings are not disabled. The other siblings suffer because the disabled child requires such a high level of care. It is not fair to you, and while some of sacrifice is to be expected, it sounds like it been taken to the extreme in your case. It also sounds like your sister needs more care than your parents can provide. Surely she qualifies for more assistance through professional health care? There are so many options of levels of care available out there, I won bother going into them all.

The Athanasian Creed is usually divided into two sections: lines 1 28 addressing the doctrine of the Trinity, and lines 29 44 addressing the doctrine of Christology. Thus, each person of the Trinity is described as uncreated (increatus), limitless (Immensus), eternal (ternus), and omnipotent (omnipotens). While ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the Trinity, thus avoiding subordinationism, the first half of the Athanasian Creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one Godhead, thus avoiding a theology of tritheism. Furthermore, although one God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from each other. For the Father is neither made nor begotten; the Son is not made but is begotten from the Father; the Holy Spirit is neither made nor begotten but proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque).

If it is used as a rhetorical device, the general name for this is "trope". Common types of tropes are metaphors (substituting something which bears similarity), metonymy (substituting something which is related or associated to the thing) and synecdoche (substituting a part for the whole or vice versa). Both your examples could be considered synecdoches. But I think only the second is a good example for a trope; the first is more a case of semantic shift.

Then I started taking 3 6 9 fish oils with every meal and keeping up with my biotin (remember not to take it longer than 3 weeks as it can really mess with your B12 levels if taken for too long) and my multivitamins. Then i kept up with just general good hair practices: never sleep with it in a bun or pony tail (french braid if you absolutely have to) and don wash it too much, which i was SO bad for. I would wash my hair EVERY DAY and have switched to every other day at the most, sometimes every 3 days. And if you use any heat styling like blow dryers or hair straighteners, get yourself a really good heat protectant. I like the Bumble Bumble Hairdresser Oil Primer the best. After doing all of this, in the course of about 5 months I gained probably 4 inches of length to my hair and it so beautiful and shiny! I haven had it cut since November and there only a few tiny split ends here and there.

I'm a web software engineer and in my opinion, unless you're trying to do integration with some other specific system or utilize a specific library, or if you're writing a commercial product for a particular customer base / market, it doesn't really matter what language you write an piece of software in. There can be specific gotchas   like, trying to work in Unicode / multibyte text in PHP is a pain in the ass   but otherwise, any language that has regularly been used for web applications in the last decade or so has all the basic essential capabilities..

We then worried it wouldn flush and made sure we had a plunger ready just in case.

Regular veterinary visits. When you take your dog in each year for his veterinary exam, the vet doesn't just give him some vaccinations and send him on his way. He does a thorough exam: palpating the body to make sure all the internal organs feel normal and there are no worrisome lumps or bumps; checking the condition of the eyes and ears; listening to the heart and lungs; checking the weight; and taking the temperature. Because dogs age differently than people, this annual physical is comparable to you having a physical exam every five or six years. This is especially important if your dog is middle aged or older because it gives the veterinarian a chance to find and treat health problems before they become serious.

I think they can do it, WWE can pretty easily make more people feel relevant than it does. In the Attitude Era they taped 3 Raws a night, so the first would be highlighted by the Tag Champs, second by the IC belt, and the third by the real main eventers. This made even the mid card guys seem relevant.

Eh, I would have agreed with you like 3 years ago, but I listened to some female streamers back then and they argued that streaming on twitch is the same as being out in public.

It may be useful, when you are trying to explain the importance of a math concept, to include a demonstration. For example, if you are teaching division, and you want to demonstrate how they will use it in their daily lives, you could bring a batch of cookies (make sure you have a number that is divisible by the number of students. If you have 12 students, bring at least 24 or 36 cookies, so that it will be easy for them to understand). Tell the students you have brought cookies, but you don't know how many each student should get. Ask them to help you think of ways to figure it out, and then introduce the concept of division.

Yes, Natalie bit Ashley.

The higher pitch of a womans voice trips our brains to things like having tingling sensations, release of hormones synonymous with arousal and so on which in turn actually contributes to being a worse active or passive listener; the effect goes as far as a man or woman brain being able to approximate fertility and adjust accordingly.

Mr McFate: Traditional strategists view war like an old fashion lightbulb: it either on or off. But this is wrong, and cunning adversaries like China exploit the space between war and peace for victory. The trick is keeping the American war switch flipped to "off" so it remains docile and at "peace." For example, Beijing goes right up to the edge of war or what America thinks is war in the South China Sea and then stops, but keeps what it captures or creates. They engage in "lawfare" that bends or rewrites the rules of the international order in China favour. This is not the rule of law, but rather its subversion. They have also bought much of Hollywood, making it impossible to cast China as a villain in movies a brilliant strategic move for the international court of public opinion. China slowly conquers yet we believe we're still at peace; that's by design. Curiously, we once fought this way too the Cold War.

If you just looking for a back up pair or aren set on what you want, virtually every shop is the same.In elementary (7th grade), a girl picked on me all the way from 4th grade till graduation. I didn speak English when I transferred in 4th grade, and that was the basis of her bullying.I was a big kid (not fat, but 5"10 at grade 6) and so she thought it was always funny to kick me in the balls. I stopped her most of the time when I saw it coming and used the pressure point behind her knees or elbow when she punched me to stop her. 
Really good singers will emote well enough in whatever language to translate the drama and pathos, which is the main thing I like out of vocals dominated music anyway. Artists without that pedigree who also have lyrics I consider worth paying attention to are Van Dyke Parks, Joanna Newsom, Captain Beefheart and Talking Heads, but I hardly would have taken the time to let their lyrics wash over me repeatedly were it not for the (more) inventive music in which those lyrics are packaged..

Demonstrating the patience to hold back and attack at the most opportune moments, when the odds favor your success, and with a proper battle plan in mind is critical. While others are visiting and socializing, daydreaming, watching the waitresses, and otherwise taking their eyes off the ball, when you're at a tournament table, it's time for your focused attention on the game at hand. This kind of extended attention span becomes increasingly difficult to maintain, so rest up before playing in a tournament   do not play when tired if you can avoid it.
The only part about the procedure that is unpleasant is not being allowed to eat the day before and having to take medicine (drink) the day before that makes you shit your brains out until you literally pooping out water, which is a bizarre experience.

The partnership ended in 1957, when Mirams moved to Australia, leaving O'Shea in command of a company which, he hoped, would enable him to show how a local film industry could demonstrate its relevance to New Zealanders. Reid notes, however, that he recognised that without a significant level of subsidy there wasn't a large enough local audience to provide a return from the feature films that he wanted to make. O'Shea's priorities were clear: money and the commercial side of production were a means to an end, never the end itself..

In tournaments avoid bluffing someone with a shorter stack who will be looking to get more money by betting strongly/and even going all in   and, also, you avoid deeper stacks that can afford to "look you up" (call your bet/bluff). Medium stacks are the ideal target because they are less desperate, and more likely to play conservatively and fold when you bluff strongly; so, you win more often there.
My favorite salt is actually Maldon Sea Salt Flakes, but typically when I am baking I just use finely ground sea salt because it is more accessible (flake salt would have to be manually crushed and I am a bit lazy for that).Here a great writeup on the difference between Kosher and Iodized Table Salt.RE: Coffee, coffee is a complimentary flavor to chocolate.

So while we drinking our free water to celebrate the creation of Wal Mart jobs at a high cost to taxpayers, the employees, local business, and the environment, maybe we should also consider resisting? In her book, Big Box Swindle, Stacy Mitchell shows not only how companies like Wal Mart destroy communities, but how many communities are successfully resisting allowing big box stores in. Stopping Wal Mart from creating these "jobs" that in fact are a form of exploitation of workers and taxpayers would be worth breaking out the champagne for.

The options for more affordable education are there, they just don't know enough so a lot of kids are taking out massive loans, going to shitty schools that market themselves as good choices to naive students, choosing bad majors because recruiters and advisors promise that there's jobs, or going to overpriced private schools. Schools are pushing them to college but are often times not elaborating on that aside from "follow your passions", which often times results in people living in poverty until they give up on their passions. Schools need a mandatory detailed thorough class where they exclusively prepare the students on succeeding past high school whether it be college or something else.
The fact that the Sindhi language, Sindhi culture, and Sindhi socio political discourse at large are so removed from the overarching discussions about Karachi is telling.

His defense claimed he was retarded in order to avoid the death sentence. He sat there coloring throughout the proceedings. He died two years later from cancer. That girl would have been alive today if he had served his full sentences and the justice system had kept tabs on him properly.

It was a breakthrough! No, the breakthrough had nothing to do with tolerantly enduring a garrulous cabbie with a diploma in film appreciation, but the liberating awareness that I could gamble in Macau, even if I was a curd rice eating Iyer. Besides, my wife was still in Mumbai.. 
The online poker world changed when payment processors froze player funds. My world changed as well, and in time my bankroll vanished. I distinctly remember sitting in my apartment in Orlando, wondering what I was going to do in life. Twenty five years old, and with $35 in my bank account, I had to watch what I was buying for dinner in fear of an overdraft fee. It was time to go back to college, get my degree, and get a job. First, though, I had to figure out how I was going to pay rent.
You dodged a bullet. 
Poker, for instance, has its own set of rules and every player must know and abide by them.

This makes no sense. Utah was just as good in their last year with Hayward as they have been with Mitchell. Their offense has actually gotten slightly worse since then, which has been countered by an improvement in their defense. Trading Hayward for Mitchell did not make Utah a good team, those foundations were laid before Mitchell.

For example, there is a player who hasn played a hand in the first hour while you been sitting. Now preflop, someone calls, a couple of players fold and then he raises. Do you know his exact hand? No. But you can start narrowing it down. He probably has something good since he seems tight. He probably doesn have 73 or J2. He might have QQ or AK. So maybe his range is TT+, AQ+.

To me, the benefits of having a gun for home protection vastly outweigh a scenario where somebody with an inferior weapon might disarm you. The opinions on this website, not just from you but from many people, seem to imply that having a gun for self defense is a disadvantage. It is not in any way. I would much rather have a gun and a home defense situation and then a knife or no weapon at all. It's common sense. People are biased against guns so they think of ways that guns are a disadvantage. It's not accurate. A gun is better to have in a home defense situation than any other option, OK? Don't let stupid biased liberal people tell you that you are more likely to die from having a gun in that situation. That is absolute bullshit, and the dumbest opinions come from people who have never shot a gun and who don't own guns.
This planet was chosen specifically because a ready baked, human habitable world was a much more attractive prospect to commercial and national settlement projects, and in the earliest era of offworld settlement even partial terraforming was a somewhat laborious and expensive prospect when compared with the pressing need to find human beings homes.. 
The Tea Party movement erupted in 2009, soon after the election of the first African American president in American history, a Democrat who was markedly more liberal than his Republican predecessor. The Tea Party is an ideological outlier within American politics, given its fierce opposition to tax increases; strong support for a minimal federal government achieved by substantial cuts in federal spending on social programmes (or, preferably, their privatisation); and harsh immigration policies.

I was naive. I had been looking for her for years   she moved her and her sons away when I was in elementary school, and it was way before the internet or anything. They were just gone from my life, and for the 3ish years prior to that, her son and I spent almost every day after school together. I wished many times she was my real mother, and I looked up to her so much, for so many reasons. Reconnecting as an adult and having her open her arms to me seemed like an impossible shot at reconnecting to people who meant the world to me as a kid.

These aren quite the same genre as the games that you mentioned, but I do have a couple recommendations that have great story, twists, and are quite easy! Have you tried episodic games or interactive films? They aren everyone cup of tea but they might be worth trying! Beyond Two Souls was a really enjoyable game full of twists and mystery. Another extremely popular one is Life is Strange. These are both on the line of paranormal or mystery instead of sci fi, but they were still a lot of fun to go through..

Anne could hardly discard it completely, for there were undoubtedly times when she felt, with an instinct that was not to be combated by reason, that Leslie harbored a queer, indefinable resentment towards her. At times, this secret consciousness marred the delight of their comradeship; at others it was almost forgotten; but Anne always felt the hidden thorn was there, and might prick her at any moment. She felt a cruel sting from it on the day when she told Leslie of what she hoped the spring would bring to the little house of dreams. Leslie looked at her with hard, bitter, unfriendly eyes.

Maybe they more popular than I realize. Overall, I think most people outside of punk don know about them despite being very active pushing nearly 30 years.

I can say for certain it does, but I can point to This Study on if Religion lowers Suicide Rates that concludes "They do in the US and Russia, but it increases them elsewhere."

Ask children to use critical thinking skills. You don't always have to just show them how to do something. You can start out by asking them to think about how they would figure out a problem. This will help them to develop and enhance their own problem solving skills, and show them that math is simply a matter of thinking critically about how to solve a problem.[9]

I've been alive long enough (I'm 37) to know that in certain settings, you just can't exclude the race factor, as it absolutely does play a role in so much of reality and the media that we consume. Amma's motives were obviously only somewhat complicated and murky, but I thought it was important to play the race card in this instance at the very least.

There just 2 caveats: (1) you can cancel your hook mid hook. (2) When you hook a player target, it mostly pathfinder moving towards the target, without being able to shoot whilst hooking.Even if they keep the hitbox the same, I think those two would make Pathfinder among the best characters in terms of level meta.And I noticed that is a difference in range THAT significant? For example 200 FT vs 300 FT, most people I know can clear 100 FT in under 10 seconds when running and close engagement distances, negating range and relying on who has better accuracy or is the better player overall.Short question, I heard different stances on the Rhop, some people have said it barely improves effective range, only improving accuracy while others say RHops increased their range by 50ft.

But, the cancer came back for a 5th time in the winter of 2016. And it was worse than ever. It was a cancer that had a 99.98% mortality rate. The same kind of cancer that killed Senator John McCain. He underwent a special treatment, never used before. I forget what it was called, but several patches were placed into his head, 22/7, that gave off electricity that kept the cells at bay, keeping them from advancing further. He hated it. But it worked. That is, until, 4 days ago. The cells exploded. They are rapidly growing, and he's been given about 10 months. He's beaten cancer 4 times before, but this certainly does not look beatable. He is devastated. Prayers would be gladly accepted, and wish him good luck if you're not religious. He is the greatest man I have ever known.
