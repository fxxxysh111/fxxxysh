Strict OOP means you can write a program without having to use multiple irrelevant features of the language. Typically a beginner resource won teach arrays, OOP, static methods, etc until later on in the material. But these are all part of a basic "Hello World" application by necessity. Java has this same issue, you have to present the basic application and say "ignore all these weird bits until later". Compare this to a language like Python, where "Hello World" is a one liner. This extends beyond the framework itself into the most common libraries as well.

Nine or ten players is customary in Omaha high low split, which has a rotating blind system (meaning for every hand, a certain player must contribute a set amount of money to start the betting). Usually a score of eight or better is placed on the low hand, and the best high hand will split the pot with the best low hand. This means for a hand to qualify as a low, it must have five cards not paired that are ranked eight or lower.

If you have a bank roll of a hundred bucks you don want to be playing in a game where the minimum bet is fifty of it. If you doing it like that then you just trying to get lucky and that is definitely not something you want to do. If you plan on playing professional Texas Holdem you need to minimize the use of luck and maximize the use of skill in the game. To do this a good tip is that you need to have at least thirty to forty max buy ins. That means if you playing the 1$/2$ game the max buy in is probably going to be two hundred bucks. Multiply that by forty and you get 8000. That is a very conservative approach but it definitely is the best one that you can use. If you really serious about becoming a professional poker player this tip a long will take you a long way. Don play above your limits. You can withstand a lot of the aspect of the game and you can consistently beat the levels you are playing at if you just have good bankroll management.

Throwing away all sporty pretensions, the package also comes with a traditional badge less grill with a three pointed star ornament on the hood. That's classic Mercedes elegance at its best.

One of the things that most bothers me about anti vaxers is that they make it difficult to raise genuine concerns. This is not an incorrect statement, and it is part of why prescription drugs, and health care costs in general, are exorbitant in the US compared to the rest of the world. There is a powerful health care lobby in the US, but pushing vaccines is not high on their agenda, especially vaccines that have been in use for 50 years. They are not making money off the MMR vaccine, and neither are the public health officials who do emphasize this policy.

Tranquilizers aren't readily accessible or practical in this scenario. They metabolize differently for each animal and you have to use different medicines for each genus of animal. Placement is critically important, too. It's incredibly easy to misjudge the dosing medicine if it's not absorbed properly  such as with a projectile device. Often times the mechanism will be deployed perfectly, but the animal rejects the point of impact as a natural response to pain and attempts to dislodge it causing more injury and not enough delivery of the substance.
One possible line of reasoning they could try to give for the DM: Imagine they trying to create a boss encounter for the players that occurs in the same situation   same number of encounters since their last long rest, same sense of it being a powerful enemy that they would want to use lots of resources to kill, and it the only enemy the players are facing. 
"It's been fun to watch him get acclimated with the team," said Doug Duchardt, the chief operating officer of Chip Ganassi Racing. 
For one, the rival captain tends to spread the field out to protect the boundaries as the innings progresses. This opens up gaps in the field, and if the batsman doesn push the ball too hard through these gaps, there enough time to hare back for a second run before the fielder comes off the boundary to collect, especially in these large Aussie grounds. The past master at this game of chip and double back was the Aussie one day specialist Michael Bevan who, like Dhoni, used to bat at number six or seven.

I would not want my child to go through that when food is available. Especially since the child has a good relationship with food and eats when hungry, lots of adults dont have that skill and will eat just because.Finding out that you daughter was excluded in the other room as a punishment should have been an immediate cue to you to go to your daughter and whoever placed her there and intervene, find out what happened and why, and de escalate the situation as only you as the mom of one of them can.That your child hurt someone else, even accidentally, needs to be addressed with her as well.

Hi there   we happy to approve your question related to your novel, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists, based on past experience: some aspiring novelists have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what needed for a particular scene or characterization.

As u/Devil TR notes, this sort of eggshells armed with sledgehammers scenario is quite similar to modern naval battles. In an era where even the smallest corvettes can be armed with hull rending anti ship missiles that can strike over the horizon with extreme accuracy and very little warning, and when spy satellites have rather spoiled the notion of a surprise attack, warfare becomes much more focused on maneuver and positioning than raw firepower or durability. I imagine it would be much the same in space, but without that pesky horizon to get in the way (meaning carriers are pretty useless).

On a different table this time, the dynamic was more verbal and somewhat more intimidating. However with an inappropriate amount of alcohol in my system, I was relatively unaffected by the fear of it all. In the first hand I was dealt, I made top two pair with KJ (or something of the likes) in a multiway limped pot for a double up + change. I was happy with that, I wanted to leave. I remember asking if I was allowed to. In retrospect I understand how horrible of a move that is, but I was a naive beginner, I just wanted to know my rights. After being too late to escape before the next hand was dealt, I picked up AT, and the pot was limped again going to the flop, 3 4 way. I remember flopping a gut shot to broadway and sticking around after some flop betting from my opponents. After banging it off on the turn, I shoved over an opponents bet, who called it off with top and bottom pair, and the river bricked. I remember looking up at the rail and my mate being in absolute awe of what I had just pulled off. Feeling like fucking Zeus, I walked out of the poker room, 500 up in profit.

Clothing, Footwear and Equipment   This risk factor is based on how suitable the equipment is in training and competition situations. If an individual is wearing incorrect footwear then their foot or ankle will not be protected effectively and forces placed on these areas will not be displaced efficiently increasing this person's risk of injury. For example, if a football player is wearing running shoes on a wet, slippery football pitch instead of the correct football boots then they are going to slip over. Not wearing the correct footwear increased their risk of injury. Training or competing with equipment that isn't the correct size or weight can make movements biomechanically inefficient, increasing the amount of strain placed on joints, tissues and muscles.

I worked for a big construction company and they took safety very very seriously. Daily morning safety meetings and every small insignificant occurrence was documented on paper. The idea being that a series of small incidents breeds a culture of apathy that will inevitably lead to a major incident. The meetings were mandatory and nobody was allowed onto the jobsite without it. If you came to work late, the supervisor had to stop what he was doing to give you a rundown of that days meeting so you could get to work. Once I was sent to fetch a tool in a hurry. The site superintendent saw me, flew out of his office and told me that if he caught me running on his job site again he fire me on the spot. Another time I was sent home for not having the proper foot wear. It was a pain in the ass but I never been in an unsafe or compromised position and certainly nobody was scooped up in a front end loader or crushed by a giant drill.

In London, those morning missions are no longer needed. Not since police Chief John Pare, in an abrupt break with past practice, recently announced police will make public the names of accused johns in a bid to fight human trafficking, a crime for which London located on a busy superhighway, halfway between Toronto and Detroit has been identified as a hub for the movement of women forced into sex trafficking.Take Our PollThe about face by police they didn name johns before, because many are ultimately dealt with in a way that leaves them with no criminal record appears to make London a trailblazer, the rare example of a force that will now release to the media the names of suspects charged.But for such a dramatic break with the past, there's no shortage of disagreement over how it will unfold. Nor is it clear that other police forces across the country, or in Southwestern Ontario, are likely to follow London lead.Megan Walker, executive director of the London Abused Women Centre (LAWC), had lobbied police for more than a decade to publicly release the names of accused johns, something only handful of Canadian police forces do.Police long countered they withhold those names even in human trafficking investigations because, in the end, most such suspects avoid a criminal record by attending a diversion program to educate them about the pitfalls of the sex trade industry.After Walker says police denied her freedom of information request for the names of the men charged in Project Circuit, a six week human trafficking sting that led to charges against 25 johns in the fall, she decided to take matters into her own hands.felt the only way we could determine what kinds of men are purchasing sexual services was to go and look at the court dockets every day, Walker said.Fabienne Haller, who also works at Walker organization, was tasked with swinging by the London courthouse every morning to check the dockets.

Reiki can be used to treat imbalances on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels. When any one of these areas is out of balance, the other areas are also affected. Thus a physical affliction is believed to be a manifestation of an energetic imbalance rather than a symptom to be eradicated. Reiki works by removing blockages to the flow of life force both within the physical body and the energy fields that immediately surround it. When one's life force is in balance, a person can sustain wellness on all levels.

A theoretical standpoint, a firm that is entirely dependent on another firm is in a temporary position, and will likely either be acquired by the other firm, or will diversify. There is just too much risk that the power asymmetry will be exploited by the dominant firm, says Karl Ulrich, an operations and information management professor at Wharton.
The spokesman, Steven Shipowitz, added a wrinkle to my earlier understanding of the operation. He claims anyone who walks in can play, free, without being a subscriber to the National Poker League. The subscription allows players to reserve seats in tournaments on line and to use a computerized statistical tracking service, but he says it is not required to play if seats are open. It's no different, he argued, than a McDonald's prize giveaway. Shipowitz said the company has local legal counsel prepared to argue there's no probable cause to believe any gambling, as the statute defines it, in this operation.

Agreed (to disagree), and I feel sorry for you.

I always see praise for this book, and I completely disagree, especially about the ending: It thought it was overly cheesy and saccharine.The book in general was not one of his best imo, there were parts that completely dragged (like a big section in the middle where Jake is staking out Lee Harvey Oswald by living near him) where I was having to force myself to keep reading because I was hoping it would get better.Overall I say this book is pretty overrated; it had an interesting premise and some good parts but the flaws were enough that I probably wouldn even recommend it to anyone.Same, but for the whole Sadie plotline, not just the ending.

Kinda reminds me of what my mother and my aunt did after my grandparents had to move to a nursing home. After they had moved, my mom and aunt went through the house and stuck post its with their names on everything they said they wanted. This was basically their way of coping though, they weren't serious. It got ridiculous, they'd text their brother (in another state) with pictures of the old ass carpet with a post it claiming "You not here! I get the carpet!". Individual spoons were claimed. I think it was cathartic for them. In the end after my grandparents passed, all three divided everything equally and even FaceTimed the grandkids and other relatives while going through the house to ask if there was anything we especially wanted. I've got one of my grandfather cowboy hats, some embroidery my grandmother did, and a few other odds and ends.

The criticism about Schneiderlin passing and transition to attack are fair but I think not too worrisome. Historically Morgan is a better passer than Gana or Davies and I think how he faded in the second half was largely just down to fatigue. As for the the transitioning to attack i don want to beat him up to much on that simply because i don think that his job as a DM. It feels more of an issue with how we set up. I always want to see Morgan with a good passing, box to box player ahead of him, that how we start to play up the middle imo. long balls vs back passes). Sometimes it works out, like his ball to Coleman vs Cardiff but I much rather have more forward thinking mids there to always give an easy pass option and then take it up.

Killdeer young are able to fly away soon after they are hatched, but there was no way to know whether they would hatch quickly.Killdeer are not considered a species at risk, although their domestic numbers in Canada have been on the decline over the last four decades.Still, moving the nest required federal approval, which arrived ahead of a deadline that would have caused a cascade of construction problems for the 11 day festival, which gets underway next week.Monika Melichar of Woodlands Wildlife Sanctuary in Minden, Ont., some 300 kilometres west of Ottawa, began the painstaking move by placing a replica nest with the eggs inside near the real one.The mother killdeer flew away at first, but returned a short time later, resting on the replica nest."These birds are good   the parents haven't given up yet," Melichar said.She will be moving the nest one metre every 20 minutes until it reaches its new home about 30 metres away from where the stage will be located.But if the mother abandons the eggs, which is a possibility, the eggs will be transported to a facility where they have the best chance of survival.The nest' new home is far enough away that the birds won't be disturbed by the hundreds of thousands of music fans who will trample through the festival grounds to see the likes of Shawn Mendes, Bryan Adams, Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band, among a host of other acts."There was a big learning curve, those of us involved with the festival had to quickly get up to speed on what needed to be done, so certainly it's not something we'd like to go through again," Monahan said.

The best parts of Captain Marvel are the bookends   a touching tribute to Stan Lee to start things off and an Avengers: Endgame prologue midway through the end credits. In between, viewers will find a standard order superhero film that checks all the boxes. Wonder Woman had heart and easily forged an emotional connection with audiences; neither is the case here, where the focus is on technical bravura, rat a tat tat pacing, humorous quips, and big "moments."

Anal Eroticism is surrounded by a powerful taboo. Yet millions of men and women straight, gay and bisexual are experimenting with anal sex. The anus, richly endowed with nerve endings and interconnected with the main pelvic muscles, is the closest erogenous neighbor of the genitals and contracts rhythmically during orgasm.

He is a great dad to his new family, bit could not care less about me. Your kids are still your kids, no matter who you are married to.

But, to cash out UP every day, I definitely ran better than I used to running. I was able to get AA allin pre flop vs. KK for $400 against one of those players who was new. My aces held. It was a cooler either way, but he was just WAY too quick and eager to get it in with me. In another spot, against a young Asian kid, we get a LOT of money (not all, though) in with my KK to his QQ. He was out of position and he bet $180 on the river. I would have checked it, but I had to call. I did flop quads against a bad player with KK. I knew he had a big hand and won a lot of money off him. There was an older guy (but not an OMC) my last day and this guy missed at least 2 flushes, a couple of straights   missed as in the dealer had to show them there was a flush or straight on the board. That same guy paid me off a LOT of money on a J66Jx board. He had the 6, me the Jack, and he just could not let go of trips.
