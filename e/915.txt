Ok but what if you get a remote speaker and set it to play some preset audio files at random times. Hide it in your city at very difficult to find places and if the cops don find it, move it every few days to different locations and hide it again. The audio files should contain like Gunshots, domestic violence sounds, loud crass gangsta talk, random fighting sounds, sounds of people begging for mercy, racist KKK rally talk, and sounds of people smoking dope. Pretty soon your city will be quite empty and home prices down, you buy your house, and stop the speaker noises. People move back, housing prices spike again, and you make a fortune!

All of this porn has created a variety of "sex wars" over the dangers of porn. Some porn scholars and political activists have claimed that porn is in and of itself a form of sex discrimination since it doesn just represent men committing acts of violent sex against women, it encourages them to do so. Legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon once went so far as to suggest porn doesn just cause individual rape, but the systemic sort of rape committed by nation states like that committed by the Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. Other porn scholars have pooh poohed the idea that porn has real world effects or at least no more than any other form of representation, like advertising.

I truly hope this story doesn get buried in all the Cohen testimony news. Don get me wrong, Cohen testimony is important, and I glad that the American people are hearing it publicly. America prides itself in protecting and exercising freedom of speech. MBS is responsible for the death of an American journalist.

Pretty much sums it up. No FF? Unreal. Combat? A joke. Cutscenes? Dialogue prattles on and on, often with long long long pauses between one character and another.

Another thing that you will want to keep an eye out for when you are looking into these online poker strategy and game plays, is whether or not they are out and out poker cheats, or even whether they are borderline poker cheats. Either way you will want to be careful when you are dealing with these strategies which fall into gray areas as you could be penalized for having used them, even if you were unaware of what they were to begin with. Remember, ignorance is not an acceptable excuse in most places, and you want to be very careful when dealing with strategies and things which could be construed as cheating.

Cover art is one of the main reason my preferred format is vinyl. It's like getting a big poster of the music you are playing. It's also one of the biggest reason why I got into Thee Oh Sees for example, their art totally drew my attention. It's something the band leader said he believes in, and one of the reasons they don't put artists name on the cover. Floating Coffin is a really good example of how the album art completely compliments the music. Also   Oneohtrix Point Never   Replica, Verve   Storm In Heaven. My brain wires the art and the music together, to the point where I think I would perceive the music differently if it had different art.

I told her she was welcome to go elsewhere.

It was a very commendable job by Nast, who produced the drawing at the very dawn of the modern skyscraper age, just at the very beginning of the building and design practices tat would make it possible to build structures that were dozens of stories tall. The greatest advance was the introduction of cage frame construction, which started to appear ten years earlier, but most of the other stuff necessary to have tall structures heating and cooling capacities, electrical lighting, plumbing [with appropriate, siphon jet toilets], elevators with dependable brakes weren't really introduced until just after this cartoon appeared. The greatest of these early tall buildings, the Joseph Pulitzer York World building, looked quite like one of these Nast structures and was built in 1889/90, rising 300 feet or so into the air..

Bankroll Management. If you went busto, you obviously haven been following bankroll management. You will NEVER succeed until you follow bankroll management. Bankroll management is MUCH more important than skill. Skill cannot overcome lack of bankroll management. The rules are pretty simple. For CASH games, you need AT LEAST 30 NLHE buy ins (one buy in is 100bb) of cash in the bank or your account to play. For SNG tournaments, you need 50 buy ins. For MTT tournaments, you need 100 buy ins. Those are MINIMUM requirements. You might be wise to have more, but NEVER less. For Limit Hold you need 300 big bets. For PLO, you need 50 buy ins. For any other game I didn mention, you need to do the research to find an equivalent bankroll. If you don have it, don play it. Simple as that. But, let say it again for dramatic effect: If you don have it, don play it. Simple as that. Once you have it, you can play down to 20 buy ins cash game, 35 buy ins SNG, or 70 buy ins for MTT or 200 big bets for limit. Basically, you can lose a third of your full bankroll taking a shot up. If that happens, you need to move DOWN stakes IMMEDIATELY. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Do not move UP again until you have the full 30 buy ins or whatever your the requirements for your game.
I concede and go to next game.

Of course if you have a very "rich" friend that has a lot of poker chips, and plays on high stake tables you can also get poker chips from him :). In any case what everyone should watch out for is Scam emails and messages in facebook where you are supose to be awarded or baned for any reason, and you are asked to click a link to verify your account, where you would need to login of course; when you login to that link you don't actually verify anything you just give out your password and account to some hackers.

To me, the benefits of having a gun for home protection vastly outweigh a scenario where somebody with an inferior weapon might disarm you. The opinions on this website, not just from you but from many people, seem to imply that having a gun for self defense is a disadvantage. It is not in any way. I would much rather have a gun and a home defense situation and then a knife or no weapon at all. It's common sense. People are biased against guns so they think of ways that guns are a disadvantage. It's not accurate. A gun is better to have in a home defense situation than any other option, OK? Don't let stupid biased liberal people tell you that you are more likely to die from having a gun in that situation. That is absolute bullshit, and the dumbest opinions come from people who have never shot a gun and who don't own guns.

I made several comparisons through the rewatch in regards to Gjallarhorn in some ways acting like a religious organization in the way they try and control the cultural aspects of Earth, and as the show has progressed I think that only become more apparent.The mistake that McGillis made was he was so caught up over having found his out of his life that he became too focused on the foundation of Gjallarhorn and didn stop to conciser its purpose. Gjallarhorn is in essence a military dictatorship, and like most dictatorships they adapt to using whatever schemes they need to be able to control the population under them regardless of the usual morality of it. Even Idioks bullshit this season is only condemned because he complicated internal political dealings, rather than out of a sense of morals or ethics.The Seven Stars leaders grew up on the legends of Bael, but they also grew up within a political system first and foremost.

The two Dallas Hyatt hotels are separated by a runway, which makes the view from the rooftop pool at either hotel pretty spectacular. The difference between the two hotels is location and price.

Data Science likely has a higher pay ceiling than Software Engineering, and maybe even more job openings, but it probably also has higher variance in general. I don think it a good idea to pivot to Data Science just because it is in vogue right now. I would expect general software engineering skills to have more lasting power, but data science might be a good avenue if the applicant has a strong inclination towards statistics. The highest paying jobs in this field are going to be targeted at the doctorate level. There is a lot of chaff from other applicants with kinda dubious online programs and certificates in data science. It a hot area, but that not always good.

I'm a nurse practitioner at an urgent care, former ER nurse. In our defense, 99% of the time when a kid (or adult) is vomiting or coughing or has diarrhea or any other common ailment, it is viral and will go away on its own without treatment.

Thyroid hormones play a role in metabolism regulation. Too much thyroid hormone typically causes the metabolism to go into overdrive. That's why Peaches is so hungry and full of energy. If you listened to her heart you'd probably find a much faster beat than normal   even at rest. That's called tachycardia and long term it can cause some serious cardiovascular disease. These clinical signs usually lead your vet to perform a special blood test to check the levels of your cat's thyroid hormone. The most common treatment is "medical management" with medication therapy. The medication of choice can be given in a pill form or a special trans dermal gel. Either way, it is a daily treatment for the life of the cat (by the way   did you know that hyperthyroidism very rarely occurs in dogs? Thyroid disease in dogs tends to be HYPO thyroid or low in thyroid hormone).

It may waste 10 15 mins of your time but you will learn so much about the other player by their actions.

Bluffing is all about acting and betting inside a way which can be totally unrelated for the actual position of condition in the player. For instance, if a player has negative hand, but he nevertheless wager within a way as if she or he includes a good a single, then it means that he or she is bluffing. A player with powerful hands pretending to be a weaker opponent can also be a approach to bluff.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkTheatre and ArtsTV GuideDigital Print EditionONE hundred local men came together to support the Jim Bruce Urology and Prostate Cancer Trust at the fourth annual Poker4Prostate fundraising event. On May 26, $27,500 was raised at the Poker4Prostate event that was hosted by a committee of local men and held at the Black Duck Brewery in Port Macquarie. This brings the total sum raised for local charity; the Jim Bruce Urology and Prostate Cancer Trust from these events to over $100,000. Trustees of the Jim Bruce Trust used the fundraising event as an opportunity to show off the newly branded Jim Bruce Trust vehicle. The Trust have purchased this vehicle specifically to transport a part time community urology nurse, also funded by the Trust, who will visit patients who are less mobile and unable to make urology appointments at the hospital or doctors surgery. "The incredible generosity of the Poker 4 Prostate initiative has helped us to invest in significant contributions such as the community urology nurse and the car,"said trustee Jamie Bruce. Poker 4 Prostate committee member Stephen Mitchell recognised the number of local businesses and other sponsors that generously donated their time, services and products to ensure the event was a success. Mitchell said all who attended the Poker 4Prostate event embraced the ideals of the event, playing competition poker as well as purchasing over $1,000 worth of raffle tickets and bidding on over $12,000 of auction prizes. Bruce Burnham from WPT League ran the poker competition with enthusiastic punters all vying for the major prize. Entertainment for the evening included the tunes from local ensemble U4RiA, a band featuring Rob Snow. It was Snow's Prostate Cancer diagnosis four years ago that was the catalyst for the Poker 4 Prostate fundraising initiative. Photo: Lindsay Moller.
Another one: After a best friend lost a baby, a couple of us decided to take her to see one of her favorite artists (Florence + the Machine) a few months later. Toward the end of the show my best friend wanted to get up close. I grabbed her hand and "pardon us and "excuse me our way to the front row and the crowd just parted for us. We watched the last few songs from the front and it was her happiest since the tragedy. As the show ended she started saying "I so happy right. I so happy right now" and we started hugging all the people around us. Those strangers hugged us as though they knew exactly what we were there for, what we were experiencing and one guy put his hand on his heart and said "Bless your hearts." I had many more but these are two favorites that meant so much.
