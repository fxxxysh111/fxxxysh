I went to the university of Connecticut in Storrs CT, not too far from sandy hook at the time of the shooting. It was finals time and I was in my dining hall studying and having some breakfast. A girl walking by noticed the coverage, dropped her tray and crumpled to the ground, crying and screaming "my sister goes there, my sister." Her friends scooped her up and quickly hurried her out of the dining hall. That was the closest I ever was to a nationally covered shooting, it really broke the 4th wall for me. My walk away from that is that we are all so desensitized to mass shootings, that it pretty easy to lose perspective when it not affecting, relatable in some way to you.

The software is very good at catching instances where words are in the same order and it is virtually impossible, statistically, for it to be a coincidence.

Certain pieces can be blocked from moving. The horse move the same as the knight but cannot jump over pieces, and the elephant moves two spaces diagonally but also cannot jump over pieces.

A post on Huffington Post was all about toys not to buy your kids this holiday season.

If it wasn for my husband, I would probably be in a psych ward. I was deep in my anxiety when I met him. He the first man I ever met who was on anti depressants. He didn force me to go to the doctor. He supported me with hugs and kind words and always a loving gesture of trying to get her to seek help. He made my doctor appointment and went with me in order to help describe my symptoms. He basically saved me. Sorry this was long. I would talk to a friend and see if they are willing to go with you to the doctor to sell options. Or simply to talk to figure out what going on.

Moral Reasoning A surgeon's moral reasoning ability may affect malpractice rates, according to an April 2008 article in "Orthopedics Today." Moral reasoning affects how a physician responds to ethical dilemmas. Such physicians might also be more likely to involve the patient in active decision making and communication, which would also tend to decrease the likelihood of a malpractice lawsuit, due to the strong relationship between surgeon and patient.

An odd or an even number must turn up, and that is why the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of the dice is one.

In the last 24 hours I come across two antiquarian outlooks on the longevity of the world coal supply after not having seen hardly anything of the sort written in the 19th century. (The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy".

Simulations would be run if there were any concerns, to test before production.

However, the other two works illustrated Sokolow darker, more dramatic side, and the company danced them with commitment and polish. The 1952 Suite and the signature (1961) showed the choreographer leanings toward stark, post modern severity, painting with broad strokes instead of flashy steps, favoring silence and stillness, refusing to follow melodic line or rhythmic pulse. As Sokolow admitted in one of the video clips, only way to be popular is to be nice, harmless. . . . That doesn interest me. What the viewer takes away isn movement invention as much as powerful context and imagery that sears itself into the brain.

The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly. Copy and paste from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on. Do not use the "suggest title" option for posting as it often does not match the headline. As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed. The only exception is that, if an article has a title in all caps, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.

So what does player A do in this spot? After all, an ace is a big favorite heads up, right? This is where the all in push comes in. By going all in player A maximizes the value of his hand. The big blind can only call or fold, so having position makes no difference. Furthermore the big blind knows that if he calls, he could face losing a big portion of his stack. The result is that big blind is going to have to fold a lot of hands, probably about 80 90% in this spot. Let's say it is 85%. 85% of the time, you will win 1.5 bb over folding, for an average profit of 1.3bb/push. The other 15%, you will be called. A 15% call range has A4o in pretty bad shape. Let's say you will win an all in 35% of the time. Your average loss is 2.7bb in this spot (you will win .3518 chip pot = 6.3 chips in the all in on average, and you started with 9).  2.7.15 is about  .4. So the average profit of a push here is .9bb. It is highly doubtful you could do this well by limping in and betting flops, or trying to catch an ace.

Note that it not necessarily a problem on its own, just that it placed a level of burden on the programmer to take care to an extent that we were uncomfortable with.Almost always, we would end up having to rethink the dependency on time for performance considerations, and typically would attach the time first to some relevant Event before making further use of it, which would allow for better caching of intermediate results.Eventually that turned into just dropping support for a current time behaviour altogether as we gradually came to realize it was regularly an issue. 
That appears to be the root of the problem. My recommendation is to immediately correct the strata plan unit entitlement for this fiscal year as it relates to each strata lot and unit number and talk to your lawyer about the possible consequences and remedies.

One, they are muslim and more importantly for Turkish state, they are Turkic. This is useful to China because by partnering with Turkey, China has an effective way of stemming possible Uyghur discontent.

1) I don't know exactly what "micros after midnight" means   as I haven't played online in a very long time. I assume it's a synonym for "easy". Yes, beating 1/2 is easy. Theoretically. There are two challenges to beating it. First   the rules and technique of the game. It's not super hard. You fold a lot, bet the hell out of value hands, and remember you probably aren't being bluffed. Like almost ever. Second: the emotional control it takes to beat it consistently over time. Fighting the urge to gamble. Having the drive to go sit there at a table for hours and hours a week without getting bored, tilted, stressed, etc. doing the same thing day in and day out   without making mistakes. THATS the hard part. And sure, maybe you can beat it for $20/hr. Maybe that seems like a lot of money. (Maybe it is) but the time will come where it isn't enough any more.

Last month, Ballarat Council agreed to prepare a submission to the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation outlining the negative economic and social impacts of an application for extra pokies at one of its biggest sporting venues. However, legislative changes by Victoria's next government could reverse the system to require applicants to meet the economic and social impact test, proving their application is beneficial to the community..

As the judge observed, the wording in the act is but it is also very wide in its scope as to what constitutes income. In other words, it casts a very wide net and specifically includes gratuities received by a taxpayer. the taxpayer arguments that the tips should be tax exempt because they were gambling proceeds, the judge distinguished between the money won in the hands of the gambler and the money turned over to the attendant. A jackpot winner doesn have to pay tax on any winnings, but when part of these winnings are then paid to a casino employee in recognition of the services that the patron received, nature of that amount changes from being non taxable to a taxable amount in the hands of the employee. judge analogized the situation to a casino patron tipping a server in a restaurant using proceeds of his jackpot win. Clearly, the server tip would be taxable income to the restaurant employee and not deemed to be tax free gambling proceeds.

In class, following Stevens's advice, Stout slogs hard to learn the concepts and rules of accounting. One of his favorite faculty members is a sociology professor named Dr. Whittles, "who was sort of an outlaw who created a syllabus meant to encourage debate and debunk preconceptions"   and whose first words in each class usually were, "Okay, my friends, let's tussle." Whittle's approach to teaching is to avoid prepared lectures. Instead, believing that heat generates light, the professor provokes students to debate opinions. "He rarely offered his own view, even when the controversy rose to a fever pitch. His goal was to make his flock think for themselves."

Here's my two cents. I've stuggled with patello femoral pain for the last year, and have reduced the pain to where it is isolated to the region you've described the very top of the patella, and it almost feels like it's the bone itself that is sore. Earlier in the year, the whole inside of the kneecap would hurt because the kneecap was not tracking correctly. This is a very complicated problem to fix, and the physical therapists all have different ideas on the best approach. My first PT had me doing mostly VMO exercises (straight leg lifts, etc.), which I did for nearly three months with ZERO improvement. The exercises that worked (with a subsequent therapist) were those that strengthened the gluteus medius, and the various muscles that help your femur externally rotate. Stengthening the stabilizer muscles of my lower leg also helped keep my ankle, and knee, from collapsing inward.

The truth about student loans is that they became, under the incredibly pro market policies of Ronald Reagan, a way to extract profit from students. At this point, the average graduating college student is about $24,000 in debt in commercial loans to banks as well as another couple of thousand dollars in credit card debt. That because the government student loan subsidies started going to commercial banks (rather than being distributed through Pell grants and other state run programs) so banks could make a profit off of students and their families..

Relatively few airlines have placed orders for the very expensive Airbus A380, and aside from Emirates, who by far and away have the largest fleet of A380s anywhere in the sky, most airlines are taking things very steady with this aircraft, as the size of it means that airlines will be expected to carry up to 500 passengers per flight in order to cover costs, and in this economic atmosphere, there are very few routes on which this is now possible. Thai Airways and Malaysia Airlines in particular have big problems utilising their A380s properly, and it could be argued that neither actually need all 6, as 3 foreach of them would be sufficient (for their ultra longhaul flights to Paris and London respectively)..

In order to understand why this "mum" stole so much money and then got sympathy, we have to return to romance as an ideology. people think of romance as "natural" and even "universal." the biochemical changes in a person brain when "in love" (or "in lust") may be innate, how we organize the feelings and desires that love arouses are culturally and historically specific. that sense, romance only became "happily ever after" at the birth of the modern era, as people were increasingly expected to marry for love and stay "in love" (that is, both men and women were supposed to be monogamous and have all their emotional needs filled within the dyadic coupling and that dyadic couple was increasingly isolated from extended family networks into the "nuclear family" in a geography of split level, suburban isolation).

This is how it works: Imagine that each party is sitting at a table, and they each have a stack of poker chips, one for each person who voted for them. Party A, with the largest stack, has the most votes, so gets the first seat in the assembly. This party then splits their stack into two equal piles and we look at who has the highest stack again. It could be that Party A now has the two largest stacks, and so it gets another seat in the assembly, and it splits its chips into three equal piles, or Party B now has the highest stack in which case it gets the next seat and its pile is split into two. This continues until all the seats are filled.

In my experience, this varies by company. One company allowed me to keep exactly one week of PTO; my current employer doesn make me touch vacation or personal days, but I need to use sick days since FMLA is (for me) covering medical conditions or procedures. It was jarring moving from one company to my current workplace, because re qualifying for FMLA after using most of my available time the year before required me to work two months straight without an absence. I pretty certain my other employer didn require that.

Verder omhoog, een weg door het bos met veel kronkels, en zo kwamen we in een bredere vallei. We passeerden weer een aantal mijntorens en een oud mijngebouw waar nu blijkbaar Roma zigeuners (in armoede) woonden. Een afdaling bracht ons naar ons einddoel, Banska Stiavnica, maar wij lieten het stadje waar festiviteiten aan de gang waren, meteen achter ons. We hoopten namelijk nog de mijn te bezoeken, maar helaas waren de openings uren net veranderd waardoor we voor een gesloten deur stonden. Pech, maar we hadden toch het gevoel dat we deze mooie streek en zijn mijnbouwers verleden al goed hadden leren kennen. We maakten wel nog een korte wandeling in een grasland met oude leegstaande gebouwen en het dorpje Stiavnicke Bane en zijn knocking tower. Daarna naar ons hotel: in Bankska Stiavnica vertrokken de dagjestoeristen ondertussen naar huis. Dit stadje werd in de middeleeuwen rijk van de goud, zilver en ijzermijnen. Het ligt in een prachtige vallei tussen de heuvels, met vele oude gebouwen. Op elk van de heuvels heb je een kasteel (het oude en het nieuwe) en ook een bedevaartsoord op van de heuvels. En natuurlijk hebben ze ook een knocking tower.

Ok, so what is your personal opinion on the research and findings of Stan Gordon and associated researchers? He has been studying the UFO phenomenon since the 60s and saw very quickly that there was a connection between the two.

A birth certificate (or educational certificate) does not hold that sort of value and thus is not (in my mind) a matter of public disclosure.

When this issue comes up, people feel the need to sit in either the "I support my local police" camp or the "cops make any situation they insert themselves into worse" camp. Reality is somewhere in the middle. There are good police officers and bad police officers. And really, the good ones far outnumber the bad ones. You never hear much about the good people performing that job because it almost is never news worthy. However, that doesn excuse the very real behavior of dirty or abusive police officers. It is a serious social problem that needs to be addressed.

If you read some of my other comments I kind of explain a few things but you are right trump has done those things and I dont support them, at the start I did give him a chance but hes proven me wrong. Also I have voted Republican mostly because there are a few things I dont agree with abortion limit at 24 weeks I find to late in a pregnancy, gun control laws that people want to implement, and immigration laws that aren to laxed. Those to me are important, but there are things I like from the Democrats such as healthcare for all, planned parenthood and it cheap birth control that will lower abortions. 
One thing that is surprising about me is that I love to sing. I come off as a shy guy, but once you get to know me, I open up incredibly. I could listen to any song and fall in love with it if you give me the chance. Any genre, if its appealing to my ears, I'll memorize every lyric and sing along to it. Sometimes I surprise my girlfriend when I put on one of her songs in the car and sing every lyric to it, because we both have different music tastes. So even though I'm quiet at first, get to know me and you won't hear the end of me.

The building, being developed by SJP Properties of Parsippany, NJ at a cost of over $1 billion, is one of the city's most high profile recent commercial projects and, befitting the frothy era when the deal was signed, was financed on spec, without lease agreements in place.

Yeah, Ogata was the first dude Sugimoto fought, it would be cool as hell if he was also the last guy, to make everything go full circle. He also feels like someone who is more grounded and on Sugimoto level, unlike Hijikata or Tsurumi who gives off big bad vibes. Sugimoto and Ogata relation to eachother is personal. If they both fight at the end, I want both of them to kill eachother because foils are cool, like Kiritsugu vs Kirei. Also if you reread chapter 166 the omen looked to be about Shiraishi penis charm, which broke when he was hanging on the ice block, when he reunited with Sugimoto.

The "pathetic bullshit rule" you are referring to is critical to the core founding principles of Reddit, which was to create a platform for discussion and the spreading of ideas.

Sometimes its hard for people around to live with a person with bipolar. I found your previous posts on this subject very helpful but I really like how this one is laid out, very clear! Plus I can from a family that always wants to keep the peace and no one talks about anything, so therefore nothing ever gets fixed. How about people who are married, and a few years later find themselves driving each other to the brink of insanity? I love it when I have an opportunity to clear more of my own crap because someone else triggers me. 
Because of social media, modern bullying involves groups of kids ganging up on one kid for no reason, ruining all aspects of a social life, and basically reinforcing to the victim that they are worthless and should kill themselves at all times.

His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore"

LPT: When you write 3 random fake PINs on a small note and put it into your wallet where you also keep your bank or credit cards, a thief will most likely use those PINs and will cause your card to be locked.

Your heart is set on Pole Bridge, Chief Mountain Taxi and is reliable and in my experience are good dudes who will give you a lot of native history on the area if you ask (You are probably looking at a minimum of $100 on that cab ride). If you wanted to avoid the whole hike north to tag the border deal, Chief Mountain Taxi will also take you into Canada to start in Waterton so you are just hiking south after the check in with customs at Goat Haunt. Since they are based in St. Mary on the east side of the park that cab ride even with the border crossing will probably be cheaper and definietly shorter than the polebridge one.

I don't necessarily think she was back to her old ways before her skill development. She's not stupid.
