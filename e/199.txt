She grew up knowing better but had gotten into drinking because of a bad/ shady relationship and financial/job issues. The other ladies were just apologizing and it seemed none of them had any advice to offer. But one of them spoke up and said that it was in the Lord hands and there nothing any of them could do about it but pray and ask God to reach out to her. They all nodded in silent agreement and changed the conversation to a lighter subject. Made me sad.

Training for a triathlon isn't easy. Whether you're looking to complete a sprint, Olympic, half Ironman or Ironman triathlon, you'll spend a lot of time at the track, on the bike and in the pool. But these hours of pavement pounding, heart pumping workouts can actually be counterproductive if you don't incorporate enough low intensity exercise into your training regimen..

How about a sweet potato and cauliflower stir fry, maybe add some spinach or peas as well for protein? When I make this I cook the sweet potatoes on medium low with a lid on until they are tender, maybe 15 20 minutes, then add cauliflower florets for another 5 minutes or so with the lid on. At that point take the lid off, turn the heat up slightly and add onions, garlic, any spices you like, and the peas/spinach/any other green thing that looks good to you..

I remember thinking, surely if the therapist knew I was coming in for treatments so often they could afford to charge me less.

For artists that create a genre/scene that captures a specific time, culture, vibe well that resonates to a broader audience, Its natural for them to want to protect that creation from clingers on, sell outs and outsiders that have no skin in the game but instead what to ride the wave solely for commercial success. Its insulting and perhaps cultural appropriation for monetary gain. It used to be call "biting" and was ftowned upon all the time. Copying and commercializing street art, music, poetry or any form of art really is biting. To alot of folks pop country, pop punk, soft metal and mummble rap is just lazy cutural appropriation and should be hated on and discouraged for the reasons stated above.

As you may be aware, most gamblers rely on luck.

As Benjamin Disraeli pointed out long ago,There are lies, damn lies and then there are statistics."The problems with statistics are many. The results are in what we ask, how we ask it, whom we ask, and most importantly, how we interpret it. If we ask voters "Do you think Obama should be doing more to cooperate with Republicans in Congress" they will often say "yes" and then we interpret that as the cause for the loss of popularity among the Dems.But if we asked voters "Do you think Obama policies are significantly different than Bush and people said "no" then we could use that to explain the drop in the Dems popularity.The truth is, if the new administration and the Democratic controlled Congress do not take this moment to create a radical break with the former administration  end the wars, stop giving wealth to the banks rather than the people, hold the Bushies accountable, etc.  then, statistically speaking, a growing percentage of Americans will not see change, but more of the same.

With your right leg crossed over your left, and place the fingers of your right hand between the inside edge of your shin bone (tibia) 4 6 inches above your ankle. With your left hand, pull and point your toes and push slightly towards the floor. While holding your toes in the pointed position, raise your toes away from the floor while also scooping your foot inward. Provide just enough resistance with your hand to that it feels like you are doing little weight lifting exercises with your foot. The right hand is only being used to feel the muscles contract beneath your fingers (not pushing to do therapy). The goal is not to try and use a lot of pressure with your left hand, but to try and only use the muscles under your right fingers (while relaxing the other calf muscles). Tightness in the plantar fascia is good up to a point, since it basically holds your foot together and provides a spring when you walk, jump, or run. But if the fascia is too tight, it may result in arch or heel pain (especially after being off of your feet a while, until walking helps it loosen up again), and may even cause bone spurs over time. There are a couple things you can do that may alleviate pain from tight plantar fascia.

So if we are using the hand above as an example and you hold A 9 of hearts and catch two hearts on the flop, than you have 9 more hearts in the deck that can help you complete your flush. 2 hearts in your hand + 2 hearts on the table minus 13 hearts in total = 9 outs.

Yeah, this applies to a lot of places but I would say we should not start encouraging it for the Appalachian Trail. In 17 there were a few problem bear spots   a section in TN where a shelter was closed and it was not recommended to camp for a certain stretch, a shelter closed for a bit in Shenandoah, a bear was nabbing food every night and going right up to people in hammocks at a shelter in NY, and a few other places, to include a shelter in the Smokies and basically the entire Smokies. The common factor was that they were shelters close to roads/were more easily accessible, and it would be safe to assume that food was left out a handful of times which led to the bears associating those locations with food, and the smell of people with food.

When it needs to run the country, the mutilation of the Pakistani Constitution (and thereby of Pakistani democracy) comes naturally to the military. Responsibility for a mutilated Constitution does not lie solely with the military, but is shared by those that have enabled the process of mutilation. The enablers of the Legal Framework Order of 2002 that lies at the heart of Pakistan's currently mutilated Constitution are the Q League, and the religious parties. By mutilating the Constitution to resemble a presidential system, Gen Musharraf was simply actualising both the institutional instincts of the military and the individual instincts of a military officer for whom amorphous is nothing, and command structures are everything.

Another important time to exercise your own judgment over your poker calculator is when you have a huge lead or big chip stack in comparison to your opponents.

With rising blinds, short stacks will be going in with a wide variety of hands so except for dominated Ace X hole cards, you should be looking to get them all in.

One advantage of getting knocked out early, is that the failures can play in the Super Satellite at 3pm. And boy did I get lucky. I got personal when someone raised my big blind for the third time in a row. I called with 3,4 of clubs, intending to bluff the flop. The flop came, and hold on a sec, I can't possibly bet this. A,2,5. The other player bluffed again, and I called (after a small think of course). Then the poor guy turned a 7 to match his pocket pair. And we proceeded to re raise until all our chips were heaped in the middle. We turned over the cards, he fell of his chair, the river didn't pair, and I coasted into a $10,000 seat for the big one. Not a bad start at all.

In comparison to the marshmallow spined Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger decided not to support Prop 8 in court. In other words, the Gubenator, whatever his personal or even political beliefs, recognizes that Prop 8 is probably unconstitutional. Prop 8 overturned same sex marriage in California, but also established a dangerous precedent in which a majority of voters can decide to deny rights to a minority. Whatever I may think of the Gubenator politics or films, he at least seems to have some backbone.

First, however, it's important to say a few words about running   what most people used to think of as "real" exercise   and the feet.

From the street you think it was abandoned. Overgrown yard, part of the roof caved in, boarded up windows. Inside, it was all antiques, and furniture from the 30 and 40 slowly deteriorating, and it looked as though they hadn dusted in years. Wallpaper pealing, old portraits half fallen. Looking up to the second floor from the stairs, just cobwebs and collapsed ceilings. They said they hadn been up their in years. And definitely rat noises. They both looked and lived like ghosts, and seemed half mad, very civil and proper but off. As an 8 year old, I was terrified, especially when one of them joked and said "You should leave him here. He can live with us". I burst into tears, and we left.

These are all subjective work which should not be accepted as the evidence of the genocide.

For example, in the above example when the opponent made a $20 dollar bet into a pot of $100 optimal theory say fold 6 out of the one time, but if you have been noticing the guy has been bluffing a lot more times than is optimal game theory, then the only way to make money is to call him more than is optimal according to game theory and try to out play your opponent or improve your hand. If you notice a tight player folding more than is optimal, than bluffing more than optimal is going to be the best strategy to make a profit.

In a tournament situation, frequently by the time you get to a heads up situation pre flop, the blinds are so large that the only decision to make is whether or not to go all in. If the blinds are still relatively small, pre flop play is not all that different from normal, but you may want to be a little more aggresive and try to steal more blinds. Position plays in a heads up situation becomes more complex later in the hand.

But we don't know the fullness of his situation, thought process, or preparedness in general. Combined with a record breaking snowfall, anyone of us prepared or nots might've easily gotten stuck. The bottom line is how long a prepared traveler would've remained stuck, and how comfortable (fed, warm, hydrated) they would be until recovery.

I don't want to get too involved with mathematics here, but the Royal Flush and Straight Flush add a total of 2.53% to the 99.54% return of the full pay Jacks or Better video poker game that I mentioned earlier. Because it's not realistic to hit either a Royal or a Straight Flush during the course of 1000 hands of play, your return will likely be more in the area of 99.54% minus 2.53% or 97%. But, just for discussion purposes, let's say we can identify a slot machine that has a long term return of 97% (a 3% casino edge) and it requires 3 quarters per spin.

There can also be a password for your table so you can control the people who can join. You have the power to choose between a limit and no limit game. Amazing, right?

She resists the seductive come ons of the young army officer Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor Johnson) until she doesn't; then she follows her heart to social ostracism, paranoia, and ruin. Wright, though, understands that Tolstoy was writing about more than one woman's passion   that the novelist was painting his country and times on an immense canvas   and that Anna's drama is just the central panel of a vast, teeming triptych.

For example, although the charter of the NAFTA established a schedule that would have opened the border states of the United States to competition from Mexican trucking companies in 1995, and all of the United States to this competition in 2000, the full implementation of these provisions was delayed due to concerns about the safety of Mexican trucks and drivers. The delay resulted in much frustration for Mexico, which ultimately implemented retaliatory tariffs on products imported from the United States. did."

This is something my wife and I will occasionally debate. She a West coast liberal; until she met me she hadn ever seen a gun in person. I grew up in PA shooting and hunting since I was 12. In places like Pennsylvania, the conservationists are the hunters. We wiped out the big predators and encroached on all wild territories a century ago. Was that wrong? Perhaps, but regardless, it happened and we can realistically go back. Responsible hunting isn just a sport, it is necessary. I proud to have grown up with role models like my grandfather who went out hunting and not only came back with his game, but everything he brought into the woods and any trash he found along the way. Responsible hunters, fishermen, hikers, etc appreciate the wilderness and want to preserve it.
