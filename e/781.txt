Amazon and other large corporations have been so successful in winning tax concessions from states and cities because politicians are eager to be seen as job creators. With real wages stagnant for decades and the steady disappearance of traditional middle class jobs in manufacturing, governors and mayors are scrambling for a big win. This fuels the competition for high profile new factories, headquarters and operations centers. It also fuels the economically futile practice of "job piracy," when states steal jobs from each other by luring away companies with piles of cash.

"Truscum" here specifically refers to those who hold an idea also called "transmedicalism": the supposition that being transgender is a medical condition and all people who don display signs consistent with the medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria are necessarily not actually trans. I haven really ever seen it used in other ways and we are not using it to imply anything else. I used it in this post because that the most common name for this belief and I wanted everyone to know what I was talking about. I also tried hard to differentiate "truscum rhetoric" from "truscum" in my wording here: it the ideology we opposed to, not necessarily the individuals. The people who believe these things are not forever marked, corrupted, irreparable people; they can change their minds. They just have a very harmful take that we don want to see on this subreddit. Anyone who doesn gatekeep others is welcome here.

Ugh  she sounds like a peach! What a cruel thing to post. I am sorry for the loss of your doggie : she post it on her page, or comment it on your post? I think if she commented as part of your post, you could definitely respond, but if it was a passive aggressive separate post to her own page, I would let it alone. Because once you respond, she will go with the angle "It wasn meant for you! It not always about you! Why are you so sennnnnsitiiiiiiiiiivve?" just creating more drama to involve others in. The best thing for passive aggressive posts like that IMO is to ignore and don give them the drama supply they are looking for.

If you have 12 students, bring at least 24 or 36 cookies, so that it will be easy for them to understand).

Similar to the Streisand Effect.

He probably really enjoys playing poker online so don't try to make him stop it unless he legitimately has a gambling problem and is losing enough money for it to be causing financial worry or strain on your both. If he is at the point where he is spending money on poker rather than on the bills that are due then it is time you take drastic action and he does need some professional help for his addiction. If he isn't participating in the adult content chat then just leave him be unless his gambling really is an addiction. 
My (just yes) BIL said something to my sister about how uncomfortable it made him when she treated sis and I like garbage and him like a king. It was a great moment for both of us because we we're constantly asking ourselves if we were too sensitive. We weren't.

IMO Marxism is just as much the same as Islam or Christianity because of the theories of human history and who humans are and this allows believers of Marxism to do what they like in terms of suppressing dissenters.

I supported Bernie early in the 2016 primary. I thought his AMERICA! ad was one of the best political ads I ever seen. I felt he was someone that could unite the country   Red and Blue, Black and White, Rich and Poor. Then Bernie, his surrogates, and his supporters lost their minds during the primary, and turned his campaign into nothing less than a cult. The divisiveness, hate, intolerance, and anger was shocking, and the fact is, Bernie didn do anything to stop it. In fact, his fund raising emails encouraged it. Below are just some reasons I won be supporting him in 2020.
In accordance with the prevailing dynamic that sees the rich get richer while the poor go hungry, the shows that already do well in the context of the unadorned live same day ratings are the ones that tend to enjoy the biggest gains in C3/C7.

This suggests that both peripheral nerves and blood borne immune signaling molecules can contribute to gut brain communication.23 At the level of the hypothalamus, the brain's autonomic nervous system control center, there is considerable evidence that psychological, physiological, and pathological challenges can activate the hypothalamus and turn on the body's stress response. It is fascinating that the communication pathways from gut microbiota to the brain also lead to activation of this key brain region.While the above noted work establishes a neural pathway from the gut to the brain, a second important pathway for communication is the immune system. The immune system has two components, the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.

While it definitely seems high, I'm not sure what you expected without outlining a contract or mutually agreed terms? I think the advice that you're getting to just shrug off a friendship because you didn't have a contract and are now vaguely unhappy with the work is really strange. You committed to paying her $1700, securing a rate you agree is lower than market rate, but did not get even a loose contract of services rendered.

I don't think you'll be able to keep this friendship if you don't follow through on that end of the bargain, the only specified element of your agreement.
