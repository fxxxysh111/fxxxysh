At NL2 3betting can be very profitable since most players over fold (fold too much) to 3bets and generally continue with a very strong range. As long as you don spew money with top pair post flop, then 3betting in position with suited connectors and A2s A5s (especially BTN vs CO) can be very profitable.

If you at home I would imagine your SO won have an issue telling you if what you doing is hurting them.If you work too deep into the muscle you can bruise them or cause minor tissue damage. If you work to hard over the kidneys it will hurt.Nothing really life threatening.So watch their posture, if you notice any squirming, breath holding or sharp intakes of breath (just think about all the things you do when something hurts you) adjust your pressure. Sometimes just using a broader surface area like the palm of your hand instead of the very tips of your fingers will make a huge difference.I would avoid anything traction like; don pull on any joints.Otherwise have atter! Get the SO to treat you as well! There no better way to know what feels good on someone else then to have it done on yourself!If there is an actual injury or problem go see a therapist and they will often give you advice on how to self treat between appointments (and you can pick up techniques from them as well)I swear by both the stick and foam rollers.

Women find men with beards more sexually attractive
I went to the university of Connecticut in Storrs CT, not too far from sandy hook at the time of the shooting. It was finals time and I was in my dining hall studying and having some breakfast. A girl walking by noticed the coverage, dropped her tray and crumpled to the ground, crying and screaming "my sister goes there, my sister." Her friends scooped her up and quickly hurried her out of the dining hall. That was the closest I ever was to a nationally covered shooting, it really broke the 4th wall for me. My walk away from that is that we are all so desensitized to mass shootings, that it pretty easy to lose perspective when it not affecting, relatable in some way to you. Seeing that girl break down is something I never forget. One of the most vivid memories in my head. 2 points  submitted 4 months ago

Voyeurism A on fetishes published in the Journal of Sex Research found voyeurism   or obtaining sexual pleasure from watching others who are naked or having sex   to be one of the most common fetishes. Just draw the smiley face on a brown paper bag, place it over her head, and fuck away while keeping your composure and piece of mind.

I know this is a bit of a tangent, but is age 3 an ideal age for something as massive as Disney World? At that age they don't really comprehend what's special about it. They're likely to get as much or more enjoyment out of a trip to a neighborhood playground. I was 4yo when my folks took me and my only clear memory of it is that I wanted the Mickey Mouse ears hat but I got a Peter Pan hat instead and I was sulky and pouty about it most of the day.

Right, the reason I recommended Full Tilt specifically is because they are the only site I know of that accepts credit card payments from with the US.

I learnt a number of interesting titbits I've never come across before, despite having knocked around in science books and back gardens for some years now. I didn't know Aphids only grow wings when food is harder to find. I never knew that that funny little bag thing hanging on the outside wall of my house was a Bagmoth. And a Weta is a grasshopper?   Of course it is!! My only quibble was the cheat of describing the metamorphosis of a butterfly as a 'magical' transformation. Everything else is given at least a brief description except for this. While the transformation might seem miraculous or indeed 'magical', it is still a biological process and I wanted to know more about it.

Basically, yes, but I say Akhenaton was trying to break the power dynamic and bring the enlightenment process to the masses. The cabal, or whatever name one prefers (I usually go with Babylon), squashed that and subsumed the concepts, then warped the concepts. I largely think Jesus was the same, trying to bring the enlightenment process to the masses, but the power dynamic (Babylon, at the time centered in Rome) didn want that.

So this is what I would do: Don market this towards developers, but Project Management. Open up a marketplace where you and developers in general can offer integration.

Susan Kaye, a therapist working in Philadelphia and Austin, Texas, works with surrogates "below the horizon" for a practical reason   she can't even find certified surrogates in her areas. "I have gotten around it by working with people who are 'body workers,' people I have trained on what I want them to do with clients." "Body work," as Kaye defines it, excludes intercourse, but can include genital touching and genital massage. While patients with a regular sex partner can do therapy "homework," single men and women, who, after all, might be single because they need sex therapy, don't have study buddies. Even a partnered man or woman trying to work out a fetish, or someone who has been raped or assaulted and can't stand being touched could use a surrogate.

Last Thursday's second ever joint city council hearing, hosted by Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson and Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung, in partnership with the World Class Cities Partnership (WCCP), highlighted the concern of talent loss to many in the Boston area.

I was brought up/taught (and have observed in basic civil society as a norm) that it is always polite to say "please", "thank you", and to not interrupt when someone is talking. This level of respect and politeness increases the closer the relationship you have with someone   eg: you want to be more polite to someone you care about, because, well, you care about them. (Admittedly the interruption thing can sometimes prove difficult if the person is going on and on, but it still a matter of politeness and respect to me to let them finish). Anyway.

Not sure if you're playing dumb or what. Let me type it out in as simple a form as I can. You are limited to such a speed by the cars in front of you such that cars behind you catch up. By your logic, a line of cars coming behind, and then having to slow down, will all instantly move over (because they are now holding up the traffic behind them) such that the back car passes everyone (he's the only one now not holding up traffic). Like or not, the left lane is a TRAVEL lane. You get in it to travel. You are not obliged to get over just because someone is riding your ass. You are obliged to get over if doing so will unblock traffic. When your rate of travel is limited by the cars in front of you, and not just your preferred speed, getting over accomplishes nothing in terms of moving traffic along. This is the way most people drive. Most importantly, it is the way other drivers EXPECT you to drive when in the left lane in traffic. Unexpected actions cause accidents.
I also have a lot more to lose if I go back out. 
This situation I would bet 1/3 pot fold to a jam unless villain bluff raises rivers at a very high rate which in 1/2 is a most never the case. In fact, if he raises you on the river you can expect him to have it always. I mean jamming for value is an option but I don't think he's calling your jam with an over pair (his most likely holding besides AK/AQ) unless he has the AhAx. Otherwise an all in limits him to full houses and better flushes. He could maybe call with straights but he would have very few of them compared to his over pairs and and AK.

(2) When you hook a player target, it mostly pathfinder moving towards the target, without being able to shoot whilst hooking.Even if they keep the hitbox the same, I think those two would make Pathfinder among the best characters in terms of level meta.And I noticed that is a difference in range THAT significant? For example 200 FT vs 300 FT, most people I know can clear 100 FT in under 10 seconds when running and close engagement distances, negating range and relying on who has better accuracy or is the better player overall.Short question, I heard different stances on the Rhop, some people have said it barely improves effective range, only improving accuracy while others say RHops increased their range by 50ft. Just need some clarification.Sorry no tech question, but just a discussion question that I felt would relate to teching at least a bit, and didn feel significant enough to justify a post. Thanks for understanding.. 
Ok, so what is your personal opinion on the research and findings of Stan Gordon and associated researchers? He has been studying the UFO phenomenon since the 60s and saw very quickly that there was a connection between the two.

In your data analysis, I see you describe two statistical pitfalls. First, you state that you exclude data points from your analysis not because they are measurement errors, but because they don fit your vision of what the model should look like.

Heightened awareness of micro aggressions can go a long way towards alleviating racial tensions and unconsciously racist, sexist or classist interactions.

I think Apple may have lost this next generation of technology and Oculus will be the "Apple" of VR/AR.

I am looking for the full dataset on the recent World Series of Poker main event final table.

Holdem is a given (not interested in other poker formats thanks). Any data format is good I'd prefer not to have to scrap the data from the source.

The college doesn really provide any facilities for engineering students to study or really any facilities useful to engineering students at all besides the ECC. This turns the library into 70% engineering students, which would be okay if the culture in the library was to study and not just to watch netflix in the silent section and talk "quietly" to your friends while others are trying to complete their degree. For this reason I recommend studying in the Law Library as I think the whole thing is one big silent section. (While students in colleges like Bauer have there own study halls and lounges.) Until UH and the Cullen College of Engineering address this point specifically, the university will not get a dime from me after I graduate.

Comment replies consisting solely of images will be removed. During my second year of college I had a psychology teacher who learned I was a massage therapist. He kept asking me to come to his office on campus to massage him because he had problems with his shoulders. He even offered to buy me a chair then commit to a certain number of sessions to "pay it off." I felt uncomfortable with the arrangement and told him if he wanted a massage from me then he could come visit me where I work, about an hour drive from the school campus.

In 2008 and the first part of 2009, 32 greyhounds died or were euthanized. The track's vet, Dr. Lisa Robinson, quit keeping data on outcomes in May 2009. She did not respond to requests for an interview by the Times, so this reporter used the GREY2K's figures to extrapolate how many dogs may have been euthanized. In 2008, the percentage of injured dogs (182) that had to be euthanized (27) was about 15 percent. If 15 percent of the 452 dogs injured since 2008 had to be put down, that would mean 67 greyhounds were euthanized over four years.

Not to defend PRC, but they did sue and win in Hong Kong too. That said, it is important to remember that despite constant accusation of PRC interference of Hong Kong domestic affairs, Hong Kong judicial and law enforcement system remains more or less autonomous, and can often pass down judgement that the central government would not approve. Had Occupy Central (and Mong Kok, the less well known but concurrent one) been happening in mainland China, it would likely be shut down much faster, and we won be hearing the protesters counter suing the police for brutality. 1 point  submitted 10 months ago

This incredible scientific achievement was done by replacing bone marrow (which is comprised of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells, not dead baby cells) from the sick individual with healthy bone marrow (again, normally existing stem cells that are from healthy adults).

The other economy revolves around revolutionary technology such as artificial intelligence and the relatively small pool of elite talent that knows how to maximize and commercialize these breakthroughs. 
Also, recognize how vulnerable new and prospective parents are to all the marketing and advertising nonsense and give yourself permission to not buy all the stuff. The baby will need some things but they won't need all of it and no magic bullet is really going to get the mother's body back instantly or get the baby to sleep through the night before they are good and ready.

You have to use your mind to make the most of the information provided by the calculator. You can use a poker odds calculator to know the playing styles of your opponents, the money in the pot, the cards in hand, the community cards and the cards played. Based on this information, it can give you advice how to play a hand. It gives you advice objectively and you are free to accept it or deny it. It also informs about the hole card strength and the pot size.

Since several people might use the same massage chair, it's important to be able to make these adjustments. For example, a six foot (1.8 meter) tall user's back will make contact with more of the chair's backrest than a user who is only five feet (1.5 meters) tall. A neck massage for the six foot tall user would likely feel very odd to someone much shorter   if they were tall enough to feel it at all. By scanning the user's body, the chair can adjust so that the points of contact for each person are the appropriate height and width.

Problem is that she charging us for her time, rather than service/deliverables. Again, it all really falls back to the big issue that we didn clearly define what we expected from her, and I completely own that. It was a mistake on our part. When she told me in the beginning that she had planned 3 weddings and nailed down vendors for her previous friends/clients, I told her that I love the same help. We never received it. Then came the invoice that has documented we paying for her time, not for her services/deliverables. Not only that, but the "time" she wanting us to pay her for are timers that were not clearly defined as "we going to do some wedding planning". Instead those times were scheduled date nights, and right as we got ready to go and said we had to leave, she said she wanted to talk about some details (pretty much "Have you gotten this done" and "Who your ring bearer" type stuff. I expected that her having done 3 weddings prior and telling me how she did them, and me saying that the help I like to receive, would set the groundwork for knowing that what we expected. Overall it a crappy situation, and I really disappointed I did think ahead of time and have expectations clearly laid out, and a contract.

''Visitation in our gaming area has dropped considerably and we are looking at if we have a few too many machines.'' Mr Chin said the increasing popularity of online gambling was having an impact on local clubs. He said figures comparing the quarter to May with the same time last year showed club revenue was down 1.8per cent and pub revenue was up 6.1per cent. ''Whichever way you look at it our figures have gone backwards and it's fair to say a good deal of other clubs are going the same way,'' he said.

It is psychologically easier to throw three $5 chips into a pot than three $5 bills. Chips make counting and stacking a lot easier but they also disassociate you from real hard cash. Real money can once again become clear for a brief time as soon as you have to buy more chips with real hard cash.

The easy answer is many things go into setting gas prices, starting with the price of crude oil, which has the most significant effect on pump figures. But it's not that simple. The "black gold" market doesn't account for price differences from station to station in the same city on the same street. That's because layered on top of the crude oil prices are other expenses like refining, transportation, taxes and marketing. Along most steps between rig and pump, profit gets added to the equation. All that is to say determining gasoline prices is complicated, and the result is that from state to state and even corner to corner, the price varies   greatly.

No, what they do is take over or start a charity for the disease and then give out discounts for their drug through the charity (which is tax free, btw). So they get to make huge profits and avoid taxes! All while boasting about how charitable they are as a company!

This isn't true for all lawyers. Publicly appointed attorneys often don't get to choose their clients, and often have to defend accused murderers, rapists, drug dealers and child molesters, some of whom turn out to be very guilty and very sick. 
It is unethical on the gentleman approach to outright lie in that situation (which you did not do) but again everyone knows it poker and you should never 100% believe what people say unless you have strategy to back it up or you have reasons to believe they being truthful.

Vanawo has two non singular numbers, the collective and the plural. The collective is marked with  ton /to(n)/, and the plural with  ta /ta/. The collective can serve a derivational purpose as well. For example, treyonka "soldier" /trejoka/ in the collective is treyonkaton, /trejokato/ which can mean both "a group of soldiers" and "military unit"   when it means "military unit," it can be declined like its own noun, such as treyonkatontaph /trejokatotap/ "military units").Pronouns also mark for these distinctions (although often the collective/plural is an inclusive/exclusive in colloquial speech), but use different stems   na, aus, yi are the singular, n au dan are collective, nap aubir shen are plural.

RDR2   for me it was like rockstar spent all this time making a great story and a detailed world, but it's like they forgot to make the actual gameplay fun and meaningful. Like hunting in that game served little to no purpose, upgrading your camp served little to no purpose, getting anywhere took forever, Arthur felt like he had cinder blocks for feet, everything just felt slow and meaningless. I love quality side activities in a game and RDR2 seriously lacked those for me. 
Stick to the plan: It's tempting to jump at Mike Trout (I have to have him!), Mookie Betts (Oh, I want him, too!), Jose Ramirez (Gimme!) or Francisco Lindor (Yes, please!), even if they're going for far past what you expected, but overspending on those guys can really hurt you later.
