So the fact that they don suggests to me that the numbers don support the "evil anti vaxxers" narrative.Just looking at FB searches, the anti vax groups appear to be rather small and there are many widely read and shared news articles that shit on anti vaxxers.

Again, he has it backwards for similar reasons. Limits on bet size generally serve to keep more players in each hand seeing more streets, which increases variance. That said, when most poker players talk about variance, what they are really referring to is variance relative to ev (which is really coefficient of variation), since most players are looking to invest their bankroll in whatever the maximal return is for the least risk.

I think if Nate job was still playing professional poker and he earned his way to the WSOP or Fantasy Labs wanted to partner with him because of how good he was then I would say barstool deserves nothing. But fantasy labs struck an ad deal with Barstool that included them fronting the money that allows Nate to play. So Nate is there on the back of barstool. Surely you don think that barstool deserves nothing from allowing him to go? Also I think the Dave stance is that Nate will get paid. But just as much as everyone else since this was a deal done by barstool and most deals done by barstool everyone shares in the outcome.

Medications can be very effective. These include drugs that take aim at BPH symptoms   so called alpha blockers that relax the bladder muscle to help improve urine flow (terazosin, or Hytrin; doxazosin, or Cardura; tamsulosin, or Flomax; and alfuzosin, or Uroxatral); and those that attack the problem directly by shrinking the prostate and slowing its rate of growth, known as 5 alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, or Proscar; and dutasteride, or Avodart).

In HxH, that can very well be compared to gotoh feat of sending back a cluster of bullet coins (didn manage to find the scan, sorry). Gotoh is a strong nen user, though not on the level of zeno/netero, but sheer physical stats (in particular speed) don differ much at that level. Zeno/netero get blitzed by meruem, and later netero only manage to deal with his speed by putting like 50 100 meters of distance between them (and because he only need to react to trigger is near instantaneous attack), and even then if he miss once he doesn have time to react.

There is a small cupboard sized room, off the upper storey 'long gallery' at Little Moreton Hall, called the 'garderobe' (no, not the French 'wardrobe' in this case) and in it lies a plank of (hopefully) smooth wood with a hole in the middle about 10" diameter. There are holes in the ceilings and floors through to the slowly running moat (we looked down to see this!). They told us that it had not been used (to their knowledge anyway) for about two hundred years! Another one on the first floor 'discharged' into coffin like boxes on the ground floor, that had to be emptied daily by the servants, washed in the moat waters, and placed ready for the next 'customers'! No danger of 'splashback' then, from that height!

This is a huge subject. But the basics are this. Players deposit identical amounts of money with the tournament director or website. Example, $50. Each player receives the same number of chips, perhaps 1500. Now play begins with a clock counting the levels. Typical tournaments change levels every 12 20 minutes, so after one hour your blinds will have increased several times. This is crucial to the success of the format because it's impossible to just sit back and wait for the best hands, as you will slowly be eaten away by the increasing blinds. You are pressured to make moves with weaker than premium hands, which in turn narrows down the tournament field as people get eliminated. The prize money is divided among the players. The more players there are, the more places will be paid, but the top three receive the majority of the prize pool. More detail on tournament play is on the attached link. (Full Answer)

I think you are more upset about the lack of respect your husband shows you than the poker nights. If he didn't make fun of your baby weight and had the decency to ask instead of just tell you, this probably wouldn't even be an issue. Tell him his poker nights are fine, but every time he has a poker night, you will go out for the same amount of time the next day. And do it. Go out with girlfriends, get a pedi, or just do whatever you want. Let him see what having a baby home alone is like. Oh and for goodnes sake, stop making him sandwiches, he's a grown man. He can throw some ham and a cheese slice on bread for his own damn self!

Me elaborate on 3. The problem with mosinlings is their movement. They are able to sprint around faster with very little stamina reduction because they are light weight, popping quick shots. This is how I hate dying to a mosin   going toe to toe with a mosin, hitting him with rounds in multiple areas of the body and they are able to ADS and get an accurate shot off. I personally don have a problem with a good shot, it the style of play that comes with mosinlings   it feels like call of duty and it frustrating.

Hand 1: For me this depends on my roll. I play extremely over rolled (I have 4k in money I could contribute to online poker if I so choose) and only play $1 $20 tournaments, heavily weighted towards $5 $10. If your roll is similar this is an awesome spot to just rip it in and pray for a double/triple up. At higher stakes players are definitely capable of the cold 4b with weaker holdings than AA and KK unlike in lower stakes. If BB is competent I would imagine he recognizes button is a fish with a short stack and is trying to isolate. I like putting the pressure on here and being prepared for the rebuy or being extremely comfortable with a big stack ready for a deep run. Tons of dead money up for grabs and with your stack size feels like a great shove.

This is how I run Hexblades in my world   typically they are the souls of demon princes long trapped within a blade, who bind with their users out of necessity rather than out of their own free will. They are trapped within the blades by devils who use the blades as a psychological warfare tactic to demoralize demon hoards by fighting against them with their own princes. Sometimes a weapon of such calibre rises to the material plane and finds itself in the possession of a warrior who gets seduced by its pact, promises of power and loyalty to its user, often in exchange for revenge against the lord who contained it and possibly even release from its prison.

Second, when players, specifically big and midstacks, call looser than what icm dictates, you need to start shoving tighter, and again this is where population reads come into play   you can find out what u can shove and fold vs population with icmizer by changing villains ranges. The best exploit vs these players is to play tighter than usual, because you make more ev by folding pre due to their increased collision likelihood.

A lot of massage therapists and chiropractors in my area have a return client fee, so if you get on a regular schedule they give you a pretty good discount verses paying the normal fee and using their services maybe once every 3 4 months.

Lyndhurst also hosts a number of special events, including its Summer Jazz Concerts from July 5 August 23 and Crafts at Lyndhurst featuring more than 275 artists and craftspeople from September 14 16.

My husband has been going to Crosstown for years, and loves his cuts. However, lately, there been a lot of political talk in the shop (he keeps it on Fox news) that is rather vile. Last time I was in there with him waiting, I heard them talking about how no one cares about the people killed at the Pulse nightclub shooting because they were all gay. My husband went in today and Frank actually started talking to him about some really gross stuff around the recent travel bans, and being pretty liberal, my husband had to have a really awkward conversation with him.

I been secretly investigating this area for the past 11 months with undercover cameras and have loads of information and video clips. I also "be friended" and secretly recorded conversations with several of the service providers and the owners to understand more about the business and operations and logistics. And I also managed to get my hands on a pile of insurance RMT receipts (and some acupuncture ones) that are demonstrably cases of insurance fraud with the names of all the "Johns" involved (many of which I cross checked on LinkedIn that work in various tech companies around the area such as AMD, Qualcomm, Huawei, and IBM)..

Jess was too tired to come (I was mad for five seconds but then realized how hellish her trip had been   did I mention she had a middle seat from NY to Mumbai?) so I let her off the hook.

On the metro this morning, I picked up the local free paper, a francais, and was surprised to read about a scandal brewing around the French Minister of Culture, Frederic Mitterand. Surprised because I was able to read it (believe me, my French is horrible)  but shocked really that the very same Minister of French Culture who has so vehemently defended Roman Polanski and insisted that Polanski rape of a 14 year old girl was "ancient history," and so beautifully illustrated that the French really do see sex differently than Americans  was now facing political scandal himself.

Crandall Addington, slim as a whip, whose year round gamble is oil and gas exploration in South Texas, wears an elegant suit, a diamond stickpin, alligator boots, a neatly trimmed beard and a full rigged Stetson. Tuna Lund, a huge fellow from Reno who got his nickname from an oceanic losing streak in Carson City, Nev. (a sure loser is a fish, and a tuna is a big fish), just sits at the table looking massive. He hasn't much choice; but if he's winning (which he is, just now) and you're not, maybe your mind wanders, and you begin wondering just how much he can see through those bottle bottom glasses, or whether the toothpick he's chewing is the same one he started the day with.

To be fair, women breasts actually were designed for attracting mates. Humans are the only mammals with permanently enlarged breasts as opposed to breasts engorged only when lactating; we evolved this way because swollen breasts are an indication of ovulation and fertility, and also possibly because when our ancestors began walking upright and mating face to face, an ample bosom mimicked the buttocks, taking their place as a sexual ornament. Breasts in general may have been designed for nursing offspring, but the appearance of human women breasts was sexually selected for by many millenia worth of adults.

People are going to try and convince you that your "motivation" is important. This is bullshit. What most people consider "motivation" is controlled by context and your emotional state. None of those things can be relied on in the long term. Your desire to improve your Russian is all the motivation that you need. Construct your habits so that you accomplish things that improve your skills. Don focus on the ultimate goal of "being fluent". If you focus your effort on doing the right kind of work and protecting your study time, you will make progress. Are you a Russian speaker or a FaceBook/Reddit addict? Your actions determine your answer to that question. What are the things a Russian speaker would do? Do those things. In just a few months your identity will become bound up in your systems/habits. And it will be harder for you to skip your learning sessions and easier to do the things that will are going to help you progress. You can worry about motivation and emotional factors once you have established study habits that work for you. 5 points  submitted 12 days ago

The haunting thing about those diseases is it is so invasive and destructive to those who have it but somehow it seems it affects their loved ones and families even more.

The current information suggests a valuable role in joint manipulation in preserving the joint lubrication abilities and enhancing the removal of waste products in these vulnerable, avascular structures.In 1995, Buckwalter, MD (1) concluded based on his research, that intervertebral discs undergo age related degenerative changes.The most important cause appears to be declining joint nutrition and lubrication of the central disc, which allows an accumulation of cell waste products, degraded matrix molecules, and a fall in pH.He noted that the factors, which may increase the rate and severity of declining changes byaltering joint nutrition include: immobilization, sustained disc loading, vibration and spinal deformity.Buckwalter findings echo the conclusions of a 1993 paper by Holm, PhD (2) in which a summary illustration noted that discs have an uneven distribution of the few cells they contain and that these cells are subjected to much metabolic variation.This makes discs/joints susceptible to lubrication/nutrition deficiencies.What we know today is that movement of the vertebral motion segments is essential for joint health and lubrication. Passive diffusion, driven by pressure gradients across semi permeable membranes, is insufficient to maintain the nutritional needs of the joints and vertebral discs.As Kraemer, MD (3) concluded:  the continual alteration between loading and unloading promotes the cleansing mechanism of the disc. Unchanging long term posture leads to an interruption of the pressure dependent transfer of joint fluid.

Even if you do not know the rules, you can just ask a dealer to make it clear. However, you should remember that sometimes one game could have different rules according to the casino where you play.

Even when he's not working at all, I'm not allowed to focus on my work. It's so unfair because if I were a man, and my wife weren't working, I would be allowed to expect help.

He does clean and do things for the house, but he just says he's not good at taking care of the baby and I am. And when he's not angry at me for not cleaning more while I'm doing all the child care and income generation, he's depressed because he's not where he wants to be in life and literally walking around the house crying so I have two crying boys to deal with.

I find that when I just sit outside (I'm too lazy to walk around) when I am angry, I calm down. I don't accredit this to meditation, connecting to nature or some such; I think it's an excuse to remove yourself from distractions.

If you're like me, you spend a lot of time reading the list of ingredients on each bag and can of dog food. Some owners may even go to websites that rate different foods. Heinze and her colleagues have studied the nutritional needs of dogs for years, and have concluded that reading the ingredient list is pretty useless. In fact, they say, it's nothing more than a marketing ploy because the label doesn't have any information about the quality of ingredients or if they are in the right proportions.

Play begins with each player being dealt one card face down, followed by one card face up (beginning as usual with the player to the dealer's left). If played with a bring in, the player with the lowest ranking upcard must pay the bring in, and betting proceeds after that. If there is no bring in, then the first betting round begins with the player showing the highest ranking upcard, who may check. In this case, suit should not be used to break ties; if two players have the same high upcard, the one first in clockwise rotation from the dealer acts first. After the first betting round is complete, another face up card is dealt to each player (after a burn card, starting with the player to the dealer's left, as with all subsequent rounds). Betting now begins with the player whose upcards make the best poker hand (since fewer than five cards are face up, this means no straights, flushes, or full houses). On this and subsequent betting rounds, the player to act first may check or bet up to the game's limit. The second betting round is followed by a third upcard to each player and a third betting round, again starting with the player with the best poker hand showing (thus, the first player to act on each round may change). A fourth face up card and fourth betting round is followed by a showdown, if necessary (it usually won't be   most deals of five card stud end early when a player bets and gets no calls).

Bluffing is an essential part and aspect of playing poker and in our opinion, it is the best and most enjoyable feature of the game. Poker is exciting because you not only have to guess what your opponents have in their hands, but you also have to disguise the cards you have. Disguising what you cards you have is what bluffing is all about.

Another option when there is extreme weather is sleeping in an Internet cafe. They are all over Japan and offer private booths with a padded cushion floor, unlimited soda and treats, computer access, a shower, and plenty of charging ports for electronics.

If the weather was still bad in the morning then we would just ride over to the mall and hang out til it was done, or go find a laundromat and do our laundry.
