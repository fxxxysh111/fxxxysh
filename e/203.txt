Full movies coverageAustralians have known for a while about Ben Mendelsohn gifts as a character actor, but one of the pleasures of recent moviegoing has been watching the rest of the world start to catch on.Written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, Mississippi Grind is a beautiful loser story in a traditional American vein, with Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds as a couple of gambling addicts who bond over an Iowa poker table and head to New Orleans in search of better luck.It a sketch of a film, but more than workable as a vehicle for Mendelsohn at his delicate, tragicomic best. The irony is that his character, Gerry, is the last person who could be described as having a poker face; with his kicked dog manner, he almost helplessly expressive. The slouch, the apologetic smile, the way of tucking in his chin as if trying to occupy less space   everything is a "tell".Beautiful loser: The irony of Ben Mendelsohn's performance in Mississippi Grind is that the character actor has anything but a poker face.Curtis, played by Reynolds, is the mystery man of the pair: while he looks like a slickster next to Gerry, his colourful anecdotes get steadily harder to believe, and we start to notice he always in the same tweed jacket.

He is about 35, and while everyone is queuing up, he is straight YELLING into a flip phone. In Korean he is saying things like "YES, NICE TO MEET YOU BOSS. I AM 24 YEARS OLD." He is obviously not 24 or talking to anyone on the phone, but his behavior really freaks everyone the fuck out. So everyone in line around him naturally just moves to another car so they don have to listen to a retarded man screaming fake shit all the way home.

A cockney accent originates from a small, very working class area of London, and it's probably true to say that our education system, particularly higher education, would tend to superimpose a more RP (Received Pronunciation) accent, so the chances of finding a good example in this forum aren't great.

To our local friend surprise, Hamish Broome called him telling him he was interested in the story. Our friend asked if he knew anyone in the cult and he said he didn We wouldn have spoken to him if he did. Our friend talked with him at length about his family experience of UM damage and then passed on my contact details. Hamish Broome called me around 8:30 pm on an evening before the conference and I spoke with him for most of an hour. He began the conversation asking about the conference. I asked if he was going to run a story. He said he was looking into it. I told him the conference was backed by the Universal Medicine cult and asked if he knew who they were. He said he never heard of them. I found it difficult to believe a journalist in Lismore hadn heard of them and asked him several times through the conversation if he was sure. At that point, I wasn aware the Northern Star office is in Goonellabah, the same suburb as the UM clinic. I don remember pointing out that UM had made legal threats to the Northern Star, but by then I thought Hamish was the most dimwitted journalist I ever encountered. He is emailing me a bit and asking for my story.

He never seemed to get bored of being petted, and seemed to like having all his fur rubbed up the wrong way, unlike most other cats I've known.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkTheatre and ArtsFamily and KidsMusic and GigsTV GuideDigital Print EditionA Dapto man has been ordered to undergo counselling for gambling addiction after damaging a poker machine in a fit of anger. Gene Myers, 28, yesterday pleaded guilty in Wollongong Local Court to punching the screen of the Dapto Bowling Club machine about 10pm on February 5. Myers admitted he lashed out at the machine in a fit of anger after gambling away his entire week wage that evening. "I spent my whole pay; I didn have any money left for rent," Myers said, explaining the reason for his outburst. The court heard the impact of the punch shattered the screen. Myers then left the gaming club without speaking to staff. He was later identified via CCTV footage from inside the gaming room. When arrested by police, Myers admitted to being at the club and playing pokies but initially denied doing any damage to the machine. Facing court yesterday on a charge of malicious damage, Myers agreed with Magistrate Susan McGowan suggestion that he needed professional help to deal with his gambling problems. She also suggested his job at Kembla Grange Racecourse may not be an appropriate one if he had a gambling addiction; however, Myers told her he did not bet on horse racing. Magistrate McGowan yesterday ordered Myers to enter into a 12 month good behaviour bond under the supervision of probation and parole officers and participate in gambling counselling.

Rice cooker. Even at my laziest, I can find time to put two cups of water, two cups of rice, and some frozen veggies into my rice cooker to have food. Also buying a decent sized non stick pan. I found that my biggest expense was eating out, but now I feel pretty liberated when I remember that I cooked stuff to eat and can save the $8 10 a day I would have otherwise spent on lunch. It also cool to learn how to make things and even the simplest things can be pretty impressive sometimes.
I pointed out that, if anything happens to our baby and he has to be in the NICU for any length of time, because I "do not qualify" for FMLA, I have six weeks to be at the hospital with him. Maybe 8. And then I go back to work to make sure I keep my job.

Right at 7AM we got underway for Lap 1. Within the first kilometer, I dropped everyone. The plan was to hit the first lap hard before the sun rose. I wanted to capitalize on the perfect temperatures before the day started heating up. The first lap was uneventful. I was loving it. It felt great to finally stretch the legs after a week of minimal running. The hamstring felt fine! I was carrying my handheld and some gel, so I didn't spend any time at the aid stations as I ran through. The desert was also an interesting change in scenery, and I tried to take it all in as I ran. The course featured a clockwise counterclockwise clockwise loop direction, so I knew I had the opportunity to see how much of a lead I had on the other runners each lap. I came into the finish and immediately turned around, eager to keep that gap I had created. My first lap time was 1:12:24. A minute or two faster than the initial plan, but that was no sweat. Things were working for me.

Besides the fact that it was extremely inexpensive, it's a lot better to get a Complete Craps Set as opposed to purchasing everything separate. Seriously, it comes with the felt layout, five dice, the professional looking dice stick, an ON/OFF puck, and even two hundred Poker Chips. Heck, the chips alone at 11.5g would cost as much as the whole package did if you think about it. However, nothing compared to being able to get a hold of those instructions.

Except for the stalinist era, comedy and satire actually thrived within the socialist countries[]. Sure, there were topics that were strictly taboo (Tiannanmen Square massacre would be a well known example) but for the most part, critical speech expressed in a creative and roundabout ways would often be allowed. It led to some most unusual and brilliant works that, under the layers of allegory and indirect reference, were primarily strong critiques of the communist state..

Give them time to explore and play and get bored and get messy   and yes, limit screen time as much as possible.

I do want to ask how you expect anyone to possibly change your view on this. For example, between a person who wants to split a cake 50/50 and another person who wants the cake all to himself, wouldn the be recommending a 25/75 split? And in this case this is clearly not the vast majority of complex issues worth debating have 2 genuinely defensible stances; these issues wouldn be worth debating otherwise. On these issues, I would argue that the moderate viewpoint tends to be more enlightened compared to a stance on either of the extreme ends simply because the moderate position genuinely considers the merits of both sides and ultimately weighs these merits and cons to arrive at a qualified moderate position (ideally)..

The first time life is discovered though, those probabilities suddenly swing toward the surety that life exists in some places   just like we know that there is life under the ocean, inside the dirt, and moving through the skies.

Most of the houses we buy, the seller asked a much higher price but knew they would never get it. I look at what is owed more than what they are asking. Now, if they spend an hour telling you about how nice the place is and that it is the biggest, nicest house in the neighborhood and are selling it because they want to buy a bigger, nicer house, you probably don't want to waste much time with them.. 
It puts into words what I always experienced in games like Journey and Shadow of the Colossus, this larger than life awe inspiring moment that you can shake months after playing a game.

I know people may be put off by the philosophical title, but give it a watch, it worth it, and it not heady just for the sake of sounding smart..

You could play Nash, and still lose. So we need new techniques to handle 3+ player games, and need to decide how to evaluate performance in these games.That said, all of the techniques we have now appear to work great in 3+ player poker. There are two main reasons for this:1) In poker, people fold early, and the more people that are at the table the more likely you should fold, so in practice most hands become 2 player pretty quickly.2) In poker, there is basically no opportunity to collaborate.

You want a specific metabolite, its trickier. You have to know everything about what that microorganism currently does with the precursor and intermediates of the pathway already. You have to know if that organism has a mechanism of getting those molecules inside of itself. Then you have to know which enzymes in the pathway are needed to synthesize the metabolite you care about and for each one, repeat the process described above (or find a way to combine them in a single message first).

They weren being passive aggressive, they were just disagreeing with some , but not all, of your post. They directly said they were disagreeing with you, even if they didn go into specifics. That not passive. They not trying to mask their disagreement in any way. It different from a backhanded compliment, which is completely positive on its surface, but negative (and usually critical, which this is not) in its subtext. Also, it was a really tame comment, so it not really aggressive either. You called it a criticism (which I assume to mean a personal criticism), but really it entirely focused on the content of your comment, and actually says nothing about you personally. Disagreement doesn necessarily entail personal criticism.

I do not know how much discourse we need on the penis as we have probably covered a fair bit of that. Talking of 'how much' etc., etc., some people can be a little over entheustic when it comes to exactly how far the foreskin should or hsould not move back from the 'head' of the Penis.

There definitely some nuance to sewing denim and your best bet is to look for advice for sewing jeans (more popular first denim project). Number one is the bulk. When you cross seams you going to be working with 4 or more layers under the needle. From the point of view of the foot, it will be climbing up and down hills. This is not good for even stitching, so what you do is shim up the back or front of the foot to even out the terrain. There a device called a jean a ma jig that is a set of different sized shims, so if you look at how people use that, it explain it. Personally I use the scraps I create during the construction process that are stitched or folded into strips or sections of various thicknesses.

The effect is not something you can defeat with good thoughts. Chocolate is a hyperpalatable food, meaning it high in sugar and fats. This triggers your stone age brain to go "You need to eat this. We might not be getting something so dense for months!" Your brain still hasn arrived in a world where food is overflowing and accessible at any time of the day. It incredibly hard to stop eating chocolate once you started, crisps are the same in that regard.

Sothe, W!Cecilia, and both other Kageros have the high attack to use it well too, but its use is surprisingly niche because it kills infantry hard but tinks off everyone else.I think it a somewhat useful thing to have on Arena Assault counterpick units like Kagero herself, if you build her for oneshots.

Yes! It is crazy the amount of disrespect you can experience in a school. I don't want to generalize to all teachers (because I do know some amazing ones that deserve so much praise), and I want to emphasize that I am absolutely pro teacher (they have so many responsibilities and don't get paid a fraction of what they deserve). But I listen to these teachers scream and punish their students all day long, and then they go and display the same, if not worse, behaviors when they have to sit through a 30 minute presentation. On the day of the presentation I heard one teacher (granted she's one of the particularly bad ones) yell at a student in front of the whole class for calling another student "a bad superhero" (how are you even going to turn that into a behavior incident, what does it even mean??) and then after my presentation she walked out in the hallway and whispered to another teacher "who does that bitch think she is?" not knowing I was in a different classroom and heard her. It's hypocritical, and I have to listen to it everyday now.

Consequently, they drained the funds allocated to the QLD colony   I have seen some primary sources which suggest the amount in the Queensland public coffers in 1859 was as little as 17.

I believe those resources are so much better served elsewhere, and spreading the idea that dogs are inherently too good for human consumption perpetuates the notion that these other cultures are immoral for eating them (or simply not worshipping them).

If you want to work on things to increase your winrate at 1/2, look at thin value bets and 3betting more often. In my experience 1/2 players don defend vs 3bet enough and when they do they almost always fold to a flop cbet unless they hit their set or 2 pair.

Basically you saying that for longer booking times (say a week) the booking site lets you book further in advance than if you were just booking a weekend? So if you want a long weekend in August and want to get it, you can book the entire previous week leading up as well as the weekend 5 months in advance, then cancel the days other than the weekend? So if you actually waited for the long weekend itself to open up for booking, it already been booked by these people using the above tactic?.

1) It like any other social game. If you show up to a elementary school tee ball game and your "substitute player" is the high school all state MVP, people are going to frown on it. Some cards are not well balanced, and stomping people isn a good time for them.

I also have some modern decks that I won play unless I know they other person is running one of their best decks and stands a shot.

Much much larger than had ever been intended by the founders because what drives the disproportion is changes that were made after the writing of the constitution.Without the college it would be significantly better.

But despite that Tokyo breaking AQI at the 80s is not a rare sight.Correct me if I wrong but as far as I aware South Korea doesn really have any conscientious laws like that in place.

Japan had their urbanization and industrialization stage much earlier than South Korea did so Tokyo looks a little dull and not as "modern" in comparison.

Also on top of that raising a kid (from birth) strictly vegan is very unhealthy since for proper growth they simply also need some animal products. OP is not putting the kid at risk at all he's rather introducing him to something he should have been introduced to years ago.

There are two extremes you can swing between when rehabbing and flipping a home: the "I have to have it   this house is the ONLY house" extreme, and the "Nah, something better will always come along" extreme. Both ends of the spectrum are dangerous. If you're SO invested in a house that you HAVE to have it, it will be easily read on your face. You may as well write "Take advantage of me" in felt tip pen on your forehead, while you're at it. On the other hand, if you're so preoccupied with finding the BEST deal that you sacrifice many good, profitable deals along the way, you'll not only miss out on opportunities but you'll end up too confused to think straight by the end of it all. Keep it simple: find one good deal and see it through.

The real reason to change is to extend our own time and give future generations a chance to reach and populate space.

Maybe even extend the life of the planet itself with some mega engineering. But that distant future of millions and billions of years from now all hinges on what we do this puny century.

Hypothesis and PredictionThe hypothesis will, unless proven incorrect, become the theory and must therefore have certain characteristics. The most important characteristic is that it must be 'falsifiable', that is, it must be possible, by experiment or a new discovery, to show that it's inaccurate. The predictions must have the potential to prove the hypothesis wrong.

Whenever (or however) you lose weight or size, the number of fat cells you have will remain the same   it is the volume of the cells that changes.
