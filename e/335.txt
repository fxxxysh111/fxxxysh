Trackside, Southland racing director Shane Bolender was giving a talk to about 20 new hires Southland employs around 500 people about greyhounds. Here's what they learned: It is the greyhound's nature to run; they can reach a speed of up to 40 miles per hour (only the cheetah can go faster). (They also wear them because they have thin skin and can hurt other dogs during play.) There are 110 races a week; 18 to 20 of those races are nine dog races; the others have fewer entries.

Serious journalism demands that we ask these questions.Should politicians who purposefully lie to start wars of aggression be executed without trial? After a trial? Yes or no.Should bankers who profit off the misery of millions of people and then pay themselves record salaries be executed? Yes or no.Should these same bankers be tortured? Yes or no.Should Tiger Woods be executed? Or just tortured? Please choose one.Should the journalists who thought debating the execution of homosexuals was good journalism be forced to complete an intensive seminar in ethics? Or should they just be fired? Or should these journalists be executed? Please choose one.The problem with old school, BBC style reporting is that its ridiculous claims to "objectivity" and "neutrality" leave it open to just these kinds of mistakes.

Wie viel einem Studenten sein Studienfach wert ist hngt natrlich nicht allein an seinem Mehrverdienst ab. Genau das meinte ich auch mit der von dir zitierten Stelle. Genau wie jeder sein Einkommen gegen besonders gutes Essen, oder gute Bcher, oder Reisen tauschen knnen soll. Wir bieten aber trotzdem nicht jedem Brger tglich kostenlos das Essen der besten Restaurants an (was dann durch die Steuern der Freunde von Butterbrot und Msli finanziert wrde). durch staatliche Begrenzung von Apothekern, vielleicht auch bei Anwlten), sie sind aber meiner Ansicht nach eher die Ausnahme. Ein Arzt verdient deshalb mehr als die meisten Buchautoren, weil er fr seinen Beruf eine lange Ausbildungszeit in Kauf genommen hat, weil ein Arzt an einem Arbeitstag mehr Wert schafft als ein durchschnittlicher Autor, und weil weniger Menschen dazu in der Lage sind, den Arztberuf auszuben, als den des Autors (relativ gesehen dazu wie viele Autoren und rzte in der Gesellschaft bentigt werden). Letzteres ist natrlich nicht die Schuld des Autors (und wird von der Gesellschaft auch teilweise durch progressive Einkommenssteuer kompensiert), es scheint aber die beste Lsung zu sein, die wir als Gesellschaft zur Zeit kennen.

So are the German researchers correct that poker should thus be classified as gambling? Not necessarily. A 2008 study concluded that poker is a skill   students who received some basic pointers performed better while playing 1000 hands of poker than those who received no training at all. Still other studies support the German conclusion. Who are we to believe?

A few of the core principles I learned really opened up my eyes and allowed me to start winning, but it took time to implement them correctly for MTTs, especially low stake ones.

Hope this helps. Also are you really actually concerned about how much time your husband is spending playing poker online or is your real concern the sexual nature of the chat that is happening at the poker room site? Have you caught him engaging in this sexual chatting in the chat room or have you just seen other players doing it? If you have caught him chatting like that to other people then sit him down and explain to him that you feel that behaviour is not acceptable for a married man and that you would like for that kind of chatting to cease immediately as you feel it is a form of deception by him. If he does not agree to stop the chatting then he doesn't deserve your worry in the first place.

(laughs)That feature was called a "Rolldown ", and the lottery announced when it was coming. Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of where the jackpot keeps building until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Winfall, if the jackpot reached $5 million, and no one matched all six numbers, all the money 'rolled down' to the lower tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched five, four or three numbers. Sound complicated? Well, it wasn't to Jerry.

Maybe if we rip out the terms "motherly" and "fatherly" and replace them with empathy that results in short term comfort versus empathy that results in hard choices and delayed gratification. I think op at least has a point there: we garner and distribute too much of the coddling, and our society may be on the verge of a struggle deficit. I don know if I would necessarily relate this to gender and sex and I would definitely say we need a balance of both, but I certainly observed a deficit in younger generations and my generation willingness to continually challenge themselves, their perceptions, and ideas. We aren so much offended or awkward about anything in particular, but offended and awkward about potentially feeling offended and awkward. People might experience challenging things, but are they actively seeking to challenge themselves or merely encountering challenging circumstances?
Keep asking for advice from people, and if someone offers you help then ask for a meal for postpartum or on bed rest. You can fill your freezer with meals in foil pans. If people want to help more than that, you can also ask for help to clean your home when you are heavily pregnant or postpartum. If they really weren that willing to help, they probably find a way to back out, so don hesitate to take them up on offers of help.

Hi. Yes they had water/electrolyte every 1.5 miles, and goo at mile 6 or so. So hydration was not an issue. I typically do an ad lib hydration where I just continually sip. But here instead I used the excuse to stop for 15 sec while I drank. Honestly there is such a negligable effect of losing 1 2 min over the course of a half that probably it best to do deliberate hydration as it less stuff to cary. (hah, cary). Since I did not have a watch it probably did help, to be honest my watch is extremely unreliable, sometimes the HR does not work, sometimes the pace is not right.

It something that I just gotten used to over the course of training. I am planning a 10 mile run in April, I only do halfs or less as I don have time to do the longer runs.

Reports have been circulating regarding Dr. Rekers relationship with a male prostitute. FRC has had no contact with Dr. Rekers or knowledge of his activities in over a decade so FRC can provide no further insight into these allegations. we are extremely disappointed. it is not surprising.

We each have a choice to act upon that nature or accept the forgiveness offered by grace through faith in Jesus Christ and do our best to ensure our actions, both public and private match our professed positions."

I thought the driving physics were fun and actually made getting away from cops feel rewarding, i thought the Euphoria engine was one of the most ridiculously addictive inclusions in any game i ever played and i hated the way they nerfed it in V, and i thought the story was no more intrusive than any of Rockstar games. The stories in both GTA and RDR have always mismatched with the gameplay, it always been either "fuck around and have fun" or "play a serious story mission and have all your freedom taken from you", GTA IV just gets a bad wrap because there as many dramatic scenes as there are funny ones, but it still funny when it wants to be, and both work better IMO because they contrast with eachother so nicely. One minute you fucking around and having fun with a character, the next they in mortal danger and you want to help because they spent time getting you to like them..

The best way to remove a tick is to use a pair of tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin line as possible. Pull it straight out, firmly but gently, with slow, even pressure. This should remove the entire tick   including the head. Ticks are very hardy, so drop it in a small bottle of rubbing alcohol to make sure it's dead (and to preserve it for your vet, if your cat shows any signs of illness). Then, once you have removed the tick, dab the area with a topical antiseptic or antibiotic ointment.

The positive effects of physical activity extend to fine cell morphology. In particular, exercise affects the properties of dendritic spines, which are actin rich protusions on the dendrites that contain excitatory synapses. Changes in spine size and quantity are associated with LTP induction and are considered to support changes in synaptic strength. In a recent study it was shown that running enhanced spine density in the dentate gyrus, area CA1 and entorhinal cortex layer III [72], extending previous work [73]. Physical activity also accelerates the maturation of dendritic spines in newborn neurons [74].

So Wendi and I decided to head back to Turkey from Croatia. Maybe we were starved for the friendliness and hospitality, after a year with the dour Czechs. I can't even begin to explain the hospitality of the Turks. Even the carpet sellers would hassle us to buy carpets and we would tell them, "We don't have jobs or houses, why would we need a carpet?" and they would invite us in for a tea and a chat. And then they would recognize us and talk to us every time we walked by which meant Wendi and I couldn't walk faster than about a mile an hour in the areas of Istanbul we knew. I think the ritual of tea is one reason it's so friendly. Everyone invites everyone else for tea. There are little storefront rooms all around the city where elderly men just brew tea and coffee all day long, and young boys serve as the runners. Local businesses have these "chips" that they give the boys when they arrive with the tea. It's kind of like a system of credit. But I digress

I find it far more mindblowing that people actually think healthcare/doctor visits are unaffordable.

With most Americans making over $4000/month, and most places having a rent of $1200/month, and the average car payment + insurance combo of $500/month, that aint SHIT.

Thumb bird. Place your thumbs together and stretch your palms out, as if you were miming a bird. Place your thumbs on the centre of the baby's stomach and wrap your hands around the waist. (the tips of your thumbs should come up just above the belly button). Now separate your thumbs, stroking across the stomach and round the baby's sides. Arms and Hands Milk the arm, making sure you get into all the creases, especially behind the elbow. Roll the arm Stroke the back of the hand, starting at the wrist and going down over the top of each finger in turn Do the same on the palm of the hand. As you reach the tip of each finger, give it a little roll between your fingers. Draw small circles around the knobbly wrist bone Armpit   raise your baby's arm above their head and flat onto the towel. (If your baby stiffens their arm, try jiggling it gently from the elbow until they relax.) Now with the other hand stroke down the inside of the upper arm, into the cavity of the armpit, and off. Make sure this one is firm, so that it does not tickle. Movements: holding it by the wrist, take one arm down to the baby's side, then up and across to the opposite collarbone, in the style of a Roman salute. make sure you return the arm to the baby's side afterwards Do this five times with each hand. Now take a wrist in one hand, and the opposite foot in the other. bring the two together, meeting somewhere over the baby's belly button. Make sure that you return both limbs to he ground between movements. repeat five times with each side. Legs and Feet Start with the left leg

Hand 2) I think you can make a case for cbet or check here but I like cbet a little more, especially if you have a club in your hand. Yes BTN has some QQ TT and JTs in his range but I seen players do this with hands like AQ, AT AJs, 99 77, and some suited connectors. But you block hands like AJ KJ AT and KT. If you bet small and maniac calls or raises I wouldn be shocked if you still have the best hand so I be sticking around here for a little longer.

I don think there anything wrong with you feeling thrilled by what happened. You chased off a sexual competitor. That pretty primal embedded in our DNA stuff. If he does end up backing off because of this and you are able to forgive and forget, then I don think you have anything to worry about.

I wondered if it just because the little hits of dopamine from perusing social media and watching Netflix are just addictive enough to make my brain want to spend time on those things instead of, say, reading a book, or learning a language, or pursuing a certification in a field I love, etc. Which makes me wonder if it not better to get rid of social media, Netflix, and other mindless entertainments, and force my brain to remember how to enjoy things that require just a smidgen more effort from me..

First off they judge you like you wouldn believe on health, family history, appearance, grades and standardized test scores, etc. the higher you score combined in all the categories the more they will offer for your eggs, if they want them at all after evaluating you thoroughly.

No girl thinks about this consciously, or may not even notice it consciously, but we do subconsciously. So then you get these stupid games that are reinforced by other women, despite men very clearly disliking it. The problem is, we might assume you're the same. It's so hammered into us that people don't mean what they say that many women can't really accept a blunt answer because it's so simple.

The best theory i read syas that in a hundred years, most countries will have space colonies, which will be used to gather energy and minerals. Far East Asia will be unified as an economic powerhouse, and Europe will have fallen far behind them and the US due to population crunch.

After these kinds of old saws, there are basically only two things you can communicate without betting: stregnth or weakness. Leaning towards the table, staring down an opponent, asking for a chip count, quickly making bets, drumming your fingers, "so what's it gonna be?" style taunts, placing hands and arms on the table, etc etc etc communicate stregnth.

Be involved in the bidding: You see it all the time in auction: A player goes for well below the value he's expected to go for. Staying involved in the action has two advantages. First, it allows you the possibility of getting a great value when the crickets come early. In a 12 team league, 276 players will be put up for auction. As such, lightning only needs to strike less than 0.4 percent of the time to make it worth your while. Second, getting involved often (not every time of course) allows you to stay sharp. It is similar to fielders who stay sharp when the pitcher works fast as opposed to those who lose focus when the pitcher takes a long time between pitches.

One may be plus 5%, the other may be  3%).

On grass courts, the lines are done in chalk, so if a ball lands plumb on a line, chalk flies up and marks the ball, reducing disputes over line calls. That is the theory, but put into practice, this is not always the case. Just because chalk flies up, it doesn't mean that the ball has landed on the line. Instead, it could have landed in an area of 'chalk spread'; an area of court surrounding the line in which the chalk has been disturbed from its designated line. This was the main sticking point for John McEnroe's now infamous 1981 tantrum at Wimbledon. He thought the ball had landed in as he saw chalk. The umpire, Ted James, had seen the chalk fly up too, from the area of chalk spread, and thus left the call as out.
Do they pale in comparison to the uphill battle women still have to fight to get anywhere close to equal ground? Absolutely.

First of all if you have a kid and aren't prepared for them to turn out different than what you perceive as the "default", reconsider your life and your expectations of other people. Notwithstanding, how you raise your kid has nothing to do with what their sexuality turns out to be. 
I read a lot (on reddit, so) about the difficulty taller guys have with building mass, and I have no idea if that true. I do assume the ripped Marvel guys (everyone but Paul Rudd?) at least dabble in that stuff early on maybe taper with it.

The first real test of Henderson's new massage laws will come next month, when the city begins to conduct undercover investigations of massage establishments, a business licensing official said.According to the Henderson Police Department, no prostitution related charges have been filed against massage therapists in the four months since the City Council passed laws that allow massage therapists to travel to hotel rooms and homes to give rubdowns to members of the opposite sex.Some critics said that the laws   the most liberal in the Las Vegas Valley   would encourage prostitution.But Bill Adomeit, lead investigator for the city's business licensing department, said those concerns have not been realized."So far, so good," said Adomeit.

Maybe I could ask some prominent people for $1,000,000 like the other guy. You know what I would do if I had that much or won the lottery. Say hello to a medical spa and a resort spa for the rich and famous in the Upper Peninsula! I know some chiropractors and physical therapists who would join me in that medical spa. I doubt they would sell me the House of Ludington to make into a resort spa though. That is what I would do with that hotel instead of turning it into low income apartments. Escanaba needs to get some tourists in and get some money flowing.
The main reason being the ability to play anytime, anywhere. The whole process is automated and completely secure, making it probably safer than even a real life casino.

So we know that regardless of whatever the current "trend" strategy is on how to get more value out of your flopped 2 pair on a flush draw board, we always know that we want to bet at least 3/4 the pot if not more to give worse odds for opponent to chase when facing a single opponent likely to call and we also know that if we chasing our draws with incorrect odds we risk losing more than we win over a large sample. 
I give a show at least 3 to 5 episodes to get its groove before I decide to keep investing my time in it. It just depends on how long an episode is. It easier to sit through a 20 min episode vs a 45 min episode. If someone i know or on reddit gives a show I gave up on a glowing review, I usually try it again. Sometimes the entire first season or two is just building up the plot before it gets better. I don watch much TV but when I do, it going to be something I willing to invest that time in.

Similarly, the word marijuana existed before Henry J. Anslinger began using it. It was a fine word with no racist implications, however he began using it with explicit racist intentions and he kept using it that way for years. Before him popularizing the term, very few people in the US knew that word, and afterwards they only knew of it through Anslingers racist usage of the word through his propaganda, creating a strong association that still exists to this day and has continued to be propagated through the war on drugs.

However, by emphasizing the mind body connection, lomi lomi practitioners add an element that takes these techniques to another level. Kahalewai, lomi lomi is infused with "mana   the power and vitality permeating these islands." For others, mana means "all power comes from within" [source: Unwrap Your Mind]. Again, the goal is to rid the body of "negative" energy   including tension, toxins, and even injury   and allow it to find a better, more harmonic state.
 5 points  submitted 2 days agoWhy are posts that are tweets/content videos from the official teams being removed? I can see an argument if it was in not English w/o subs, but the rest of the content is all great and it's amazing to see more teams doing something this season, so their content should be visible to everyone and not removed because of some rule. Official Team content/tweets etc should be an exception as they are the official pro teams either making a meme about a match, or giving insight to how their team works, no reason any of that should be removed since it's the pro teams you watch play this game.

I've never raped, murdered, stolen, hurt animals or anything else unimaginable. I think I have a decent moral compass that was instilled by my parents, who have always taught us to try and always do the right thing. I never needed the threat of an angry god to "keep me in line". I understand religion helps some people and that's fine. But I have never understood this thinking and never will.

Any event, I share this now for the graphics, and the Manhattan Destroyed map. (The first published map of the rings of destruction of an atomic bomb any city of so far as I can tell appeared in the great PM newspaper the day after Hiroshima, showing what sort of effects the bomb would have on a profile not of Hiroshima, but of Manhattan. A matter of fact the entire issue of the ad free newspaper was devoted to the bombing, Hiroshima receiving more (and better) coverage than in any newspaper reporting I have seen in the first week after the bomb was dropped..

The FO did not have a bad plan, there were some mistakes along the way and moves that didn work out, but we all knew what the plan was going into this season after we got LeBron and lost out on PG: Don commit long term to anyone, make the playoffs and hopefully develop the young players and add this summer.For me, the biggest mistake for the FO was the lack of quality depth, but honestly good depth doesn matter if we lose LeBron to injury, the roster is significantly worse than our roster last year because we were only handing out 1 year deals.

Each LGA that lost more than Wollongong was in western Sydney, except for Wyong at No.

Because the start of your commute is a place of your choosing. This sounds like you are advocating for paying employees differently for a factor that has nothing to do with their job experience or performance, which is inherently discriminatory. Wouldn you be pissed of an equally qualified employee got paid an extra $200 per month for doing the same exact job as you and working the same hours just because they bought a house out by the beach instead of closer to the city?.

Nip the hangnail close to the skin. Use your sharp clean clipper and start nipping the hangnail. Don't try to pull too hard. It may cause your skin to bleed. Don't use regular craft scissors to trim a hangnail. These will be too big and may cause you further injury.

And for the vast majority of people who do gamble it's not a problem and it can be part of the entertainment. I love a day at the races, I don't bet on every race by any means, I'm a small punter, small amounts of money and small numbers of races, but it's great to see the horses, it's great to mix with the people and on a fine sunny day like I experienced last Saturday, it's a wonderful experience.. 
It also draws a great deal of attention to the hip line. When women play with their hands, they appear extremely nervous and agitated. You do not want to distract the listener with your gestures. 
From the beginning, the focus of the investigation was on targeting the people responsible for exploiting and profiting from the Chinese women being brought into the country to staff the parlors, and not on the men who patronize them, Nollette and Umporowicz said.

It was amiable. 
A quick calculation says I have a 16% chance to hit my straight if I go to the turn, and a 32% chance to win if I go to the river. Depending on what you're opponent is holding, and what they have has already hit, your odds will change. In the above example if you're opponent is holding pocket AA, and has a made set, you still have a 27% chance to win if you go to the river. 
Talking about stuff can really help, even if it seems stupid. 
1) We all fight against this same problem. Even the people who figured how to escape this and have reclaimed their creativity, live their passion, and are happy with how they spend their free time, all said the same thing: "Yeah, I have to actively fight against this urge, too."
So, what tends to make gambling on the internet so appealing? Yes, it is possible to play any game of the choice with no possessing to leave your preferred chair. 
8) Excessive Spam. Posting multiple threads a day in excessive use. Can read as many as 8 hands at the same time, even can remember what people folded on 4th street although he wasn physically present in the room at the time. The only time he didn have a dead read on his opponent, he just decided to win the pot anyway and got a world champion to 4b/fold to 5b in limit holdem preflop, which has probably never happened otherwise in the history of anything.
Tastes fine. 
Also, are your blinds going to raise throughout the evening? If so, then being aggressive in the early rounds of betting can be advantageous because you can "steal" the blinds. You've got great cards but act disinterested and bet low for the first few rounds of betting in order to get your opponents to keep putting money in the pot, which they wouldn't do if they thought you had great cards. This can backfire on you, of course, because it allows people with longshot hands to stick around (like making a flush on the last card that will beat your three of a kind, or whatever). 
Variety is the spice of (your sex) life. You need to see each situation that pops up and ask yourself, is there an opportunity to make something out of this? And you can start Superbowl Sunday! You know the old saying, when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade? Well, same idea here, but it's when life hands you the Superbowl, you make SUPERSEX. The idea is you and your man are going to make little wagers on the game or things surrounding the game.

Selective is a terrible word here, so forgive me for using it again below. I don't think it captures the way the schools use it vs the accepted use of the word selective. Our application governing body even warns us not to use acceptance rate to gauge selectivity, and instead to rely on our MSAR which gives us all the exact stats from the previous application cycle including acceptance median age, genders, race, test and gpa scores as well as states of origin (which is how people know west is biased for west, east is biased for east)..
