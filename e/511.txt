Neurosci., Article (Web): February 15, 2013Olive Oil Derived Oleocanthal Enhances  Amyloid Clearance as a Potential Neuroprotective Mechanism against Alzheimer's Disease: In Vitro and in Vivo StudiesAlaa H. Abuznait , Hisham Qosa , Belnaser A. Busnena , Khalid A. El Sayed , and Amal Kaddoumi Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Louisiana at Monroe, 1800 Bienville Drive, Monroe, Louisiana 71201, United StatesOleocanthal, a phenolic component of extra virgin olive oil, has been recently linked to reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by accumulation of  amyloid (A) and tau proteins in the brain.However, the mechanism by which oleocanthal exerts its neuroprotective effect is still incompletely understood.Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for the potential of oleocanthal to enhance A clearance from the brain via up regulation of P glycoprotein (P gp) and LDL lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1), major A transport proteins, at the blood brain barrier (BBB).

Different players have different game styles so base your game play on them. If a player is tight, place larger bets. If the player likes to call all the time, don't bet too often; but if you do, bet big. Whatever style your opponent employs, have a style that can counter their game. Do not stick to one strategy for every game because this will obviously make your opponents read you more easily.

Results from in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated similar and consistent pattern of oleocanthal in controlling A levels.In cultured mice brain endothelial cells, oleocanthal treatment increased P gp and LRP1 expression and activity.Brain efflux index (BEI%) studies of125I A40showed that administration of oleocanthal extracted from extra virgin olive oil to C57BL/6 wild type mice enhanced125I A40clearance from the brain and increased the BEI% from 62.0  3.0% for control mice to 79.9  1.6% for oleocanthal treated mice.Increased P gp and LRP1 expression in the brain microvessels and inhibition studies confirmed the role of up regulation of these proteins in enhancing125I A40clearance after oleocanthal treatment.Furthermore, our results demonstrated significant increase in125I A40degradation as a result of the up regulation of A degrading enzymes following oleocanthal treatment.In conclusion, these findings provide experimental support that potential reduced risk of AD associated with extra virgin olive oil could be mediated by enhancement of A clearance from the brain.Curr Pharm Des.

Brendan probably would have been convicted in 48 or 49 of the 50 states because it is extremely difficult for jurors to understand how or why people would confess to crimes they didn commit. You can take your average 12 people off the street and expect them to know anything about how coercive police interrogations can be, or how vulnerable people like Brendan are. It a travesty that our system does not require jurors involved in major criminal cases to attend a training course prior to serving as a juror, so that they can understand all the ways that people have been falsely convicted. Law enforcement personnel often do not perform their duties in a professional manner, as evidenced by the interrogations of Brendan Dassey. How can anyone expect that jurors will do an adequate job of assessing such police interrogations? The process is disgracefully inadequate nationwide.

What I wish for him is to experience the full ravages of his Alzheimer while locked away in a federal prison. I want him to wake up every morning, alone, enclosed in a concrete box and not fully understand why he is there. I expect that, without his hair care, expensive suits, spray tans, and cosmetic surgery he will look into the mirror and see a fat, bald, pale man who he does not even recognize. I think about him asking every morning if he has any visitors, but just like every other day they tell him no; no one is here to see him. Deep down he knows that his family, his business partners, and even his lawyers have abandoned him but as his memories fade he will forget what he did to hurt them and only remember them as they were   which will make his isolation even more painful. So he will sit there in his loneliness, barely looking at a tiny TV stuck playing nothing but CNN until the end of the day when he will shuffle back to his cell. He walks past the diverse population of inmates who look at him with nothing with disdain. Even the guards reject his occasional attempts at communication   attempts at any human contact   and so he sighs and lays himself down for another sleepless night on a tiny wire mattress. Goodnight Mr. President.

Curated by the San Francisco Film Society, the festival is hosted by your favorite local film venues, from the Sundance Kabuki in Japantown to the Pacific Film Archive on the UC Berkeley campus. It will be impossible to go to the movies in the next few weeks and not hear something about SFIFF. With the festival's annual inception, the landscape of the city changes. Suddenly, it buzzes with the enthusiasm of cinephiles, filmmakers, actors and artists from all over. This year's highlights include the opening night film, "Farewell My Queen," directed by Benoit Jacquot; the new thriller "Twixt" by old timer Francis Ford Coppola; a Castro Theatre presentation of Buster Keaton shorts accompanied by the live music of tUnE yArDs. Amid the headliners, the fest offers smaller narrative films and documentaries and a few experiments that integrate both (such as provocateur Harmony Korine's "The Fourth Dimension"). SFIFF will give several awards, including a directing prize for Kenneth Branagh and a tribute to the brazen Judy Davis.

Firstly, tighten up preflop unless its really shorthanded. Hands are made quite a bit more often, so be wary when you get low flushes/straights/etc or 2nd/3rd/4th lo.Aside from that and other really basic stuff it really depends how the rest of the table as a whole is playing too, in particular pay attention to their hands at showdowns and their bet sizing/frequencies.There really no major changes tbh, other than upping your standards a bit in general.

Dead card: If you run through the draw deck during play, shuffle all the discard piles together to create a new draw deck. After you've done so, you may encounter a dead card. This occurs when you hold a card that can't be played on the board. For example, the cards in your hand include an eight of hearts, but when you look for the corresponding spaces on the board, you realize they're both already occupied by another player's chips. You now have a dead card, which you can announce as such and discard at the beginning of your turn. If you forget to do so before the next player completes his turn, then you'll forfeit the right to draw a card. You'll have the distinct disadvantage of playing each turn with fewer cards than your opponents   for the remainder of the game. It pays to pay attention!Table talk: If your teammate hasn't noticed a potential sequence and begins to place his chip in the wrong space, mum's the word. If you utter advice (or give a pointed cough or even gesticulate wildly), every member of your team will have to place a card in the discard pile   and play the rest of the game using a short deck [source: Jax Ltd]. This rule may sound harsh, but it adds emotional tension to the game   and ensures that each player will rely on her own wits and learn from her mistakes.

This is an additional pathway that microbiota and pathogenic bacteria use to communicate with the brain via the immune system or through activation of local neurons in the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is a part of the autonomic nervous system that is housed in the gut and is responsible for gut motility and other normal gut functions.28 It is a vast network of neurons that are the first points of contact for microbiota in the intestinal lumen and are an important component of the brain gut axis.One of the most common clinical features of depression is dysregulation of the stress response system, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis.29 As was previously noted, in response to psychological, physiological, and pathological challenges, neurons in the hypothalamus are activated and signal the pituitary to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone into the bloodstream, which in turn activates the adrenal gland to release the stress hormone cortisol. The stress response, or HPA activation, is part of our normal homeostatic processes, and yet, in depression, it is often overactive or, in some cases, underactive.29 One of the first studies considering stress and microbiota demonstrated that germ free mice have an overactive stress response.23 A more recent study has shown that stress exposure during early life in rats disrupts the microbiota profile and leads to increased stress reactivity in adulthood.30 Importantly, in this study, treatment of rat pups with probiotic Lactobacillus sp.

The myth that a low exchange rate encourages economic growth took hold in Canada in the 1990s. Canada manufacturing growth was led by low wage industries such as clothing, textiles and furniture, where employment rose 29.7% from 1992 to 2000. The flimsy basis for this allocation of resources was fully revealed, when a rising dollar and China exports devastated these industries. In retrospect, one can only look back with wonder and astonishment thatCanada acted as if our future lay in investing in low wage industries predicated on a chronically low exchange rate. dollars. It was a business model doomed to fail when the exchange rate started to appreciate.

On average, I mean.Which is why the Chappelle joke doesn really work for me, but I can see why it would work for men, who (on average) just don get the part about being a victim of a crime meant to demean their personhood, but can get the part about fearing violence itself.So I judge the snot out of Stephanie Meyer for the fact that part of the proceeds of her book went to anti LGBT organizations via tithes to the Mormon church. And I judge her and the books for some of the terrible world views.

Also, not all of them belong to the Congress party; and we all know what charlatans the regional MPs are. So the prime minister, instead of controlling these grown ups or coaxing them into policy decisions or ensuring they keep their hands out of the till, pretty much leaves everybody to his or her own device. 
They never checked me out. I could have been a hoarder or an abuser. They have no idea what living arrangements were made for the dog. I just knew I couldn't give this dog back to them.

A lot of them say so little about the book that sometimes I wonder if they even read it or if they just know that they could get some easy karma by saying they just read Harry Potter at the age of 27. I seen some posts where the person basically says "the themes, the plot, the characters, they were all so good that all I can say is WOW. I couldn put it down, I kept tearing up from emotions.

There's nothing in the pail that shouldn't have been thrown away, and no stale pieces in the bread box. Of course, she was trained up with you but, then, she went to college afterwards. I notice she's got my tobacco stripe quilt on the bed here, and that big round braided mat of yours before her living room fire.

The only thing I can say is try to get back exercising, even if it's just something like a walk in the morning   get some fresh air, etc. That whole 'exercise helps your mood' is a thing, and I find the less I exercise the more brooding I tend to do. And this is coming from someone that despises working out   and I manage to get up at 5AM to do it! You can too. Your heart doesn't have to be in it, mine never is that is for damn sure. You owe it to yourself, and you can definitely do it. Onward and upward!

That sounds like a great plan in the current climate. I feel like there so much more planning required now than 5 or 6 years ago. Back then it was just a simple "read up on what cards not to get, get everything else, also know about Amex 1 per lifetime". 1 point  submitted 25 days ago

You definitely can challenge a feeling. You can acknowledge the fear, and remind yourself that it's false. You can use knowledge to reduce fear, or various therapies to change how you feel. In difficult cases you can always go to therapy. For example I was terrified of spiders, like I would run screaming at the sight of one, and it's not am exaggeration. I ended up inna situation where spiders were unavoidable, and I know that knowledge typically reduces fear. So I spend a lot of time staring at photos of spiders and reading about them. I now let some live in my phone depending on the kind, and others I gently remove. With bigger fear based issues in my life, I've gone to therapy and done work using EMDR which is very helpful. As a kid, I was afraid of black people, but I kept telling myself "it's just a person." As an adult, the more exposed I was to different ethnicities and cultures the less afraid I was of people different than myself. I still find myself making unconscious biases time to time, but my fear of others different than myself has greatly reduced.

Yup, he flipped hard on this bit. He changed his mind when he actually assumed office. You can call that dishonest if you want to, but I personally believe he only saw two options to deal with the terror threat. Either an all out war including an invasion, or a combination of mass surveillance and drone strikes/JSOC operations. He chose the second option and I personally believe it was the best decision to make. Doing nothing simply wasn an option.

I get what hes saying but the moment a word hits someone elses ears it gets wrapped up in whatever context they want to interpret it as unless youve made your context clear or end up doing so. Yes words are neutral, you can even call them sounds put together but there wouldnt be a need to call them words if they didnt have a meaning already. The discussion of racism will never end, i think its just a matter of realizing theres no definitive answers to the idea of political correctness at least, just be respectful and mindful and dont expect others to interpret something exactly the same way you do..

If you were raised in the West (especially in the United States), you cannot simply "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" and make yourself do anything with pure will power. From birth, children are given mixed messages about what they are supposed to do. They are told to go to school and get good grades. But then those same children (especially in the teenage years) look to the adults and see the end goal of their education. They see broken families, alcoholism and addiction rampant and they see adults chasing after money so they can buy a bigger house and fancier car. A big house, without love, feels empty. A BMW, at the cost of real connections to family and friends and community, is a poor substitute for real connection. On top of that, in the West, we are not even taught any decent ritualistic practices, such as meditation, martial arts, prayer, etc. Well, yes, prayer is taught in religions, but the religions are often chock full of toxic shame, so good luck there!

Should a chassis ground be connected to the power source, it would be a straight short to ground from the power supply. Identification of all the wires extending from the motor should be identified, by either use of an ohm meter, and in some cases, the only way to know is to remove the end housings and physically identify where the external leads are connected on the windings.

Ultimately, a professional relationship has the best chance of being repaired and causing the least financial fallout when the one who caused the mistrust owns up to his actions.

So the fact that they don suggests to me that the numbers don support the "evil anti vaxxers" narrative.Just looking at FB searches, the anti vax groups appear to be rather small and there are many widely read and shared news articles that shit on anti vaxxers. Again, I could see this being a larger problem among whites in places like California and the US Pacific Northwest but all I ever known when I was growing up here in Ontario is that nearly all kids get their shots.

Damn, I glad the Reddit admins actually listen and act on reports you guys pass up to them. A sub I mod on another account has had consistent issues with people PMing members and sexually harassing them and admins just said they couldn see any negative intent, we had to couch it as the harassers spamming members to get them to do anything. I wonder if sub size has anything to do with it..

Turnitin's own data points out that "the odds of writing the same 16 words in the same order by chance are one in a trillion." The software is very good at catching instances where words are in the same order and it is virtually impossible, statistically, for it to be a coincidence.

It is a tricky topic though, since equality still has some ways to go in Germany and I can see the argument being made either way myself, if these grammatically masculin words are gender inclusive, or if having the feminin version changes an underlying way of thinking.

In a game of political poker brinkmanship Zuma has not played his best cards yet in a counter offensive. He is playing carrot stick with those in his own party, rewarding them for loyalty but threatening to expose their own corruption scandals if they appose him. Zuma can nationalize all white owned farmland distribute it to the masses of impoverished black South Africans for subsistence farming, a highly popular move which will instantly transform Zuma from villain to hero for many, albeit it will destroy the agricultural industry land banks. With popular support now behind him, Zuma can then go for broke defy the constitutional court go for 3rd term as president, cancelling or rigging national elections. The justice system has been toothless in arresting him dragging his ass in handcuffs to court, mass protests even ANC critics have not been able to dislodge him Zuma remains defiant arrogant like a traditional Africa dictator of another failed state, with him his henchmen looting the treasury, which is where his ambitions lie.

Physics is sufficiently far developed to state that there will never be a way to make a proton or a neutron or any other nucleus simply disappear and convert its entire mass into energy. It is true that there are processes by which various smaller particles positive and negative electrons and mesons are annihilated, but all these phenomena involve at least one particle which does not normally occur in nature and therefore must first be created, and this creation process consumes as much energy as is afterwards liberated.

Very cute indeed. Are there any scientific studies out there to prove frogs do infact form emotional bonds with eachother? When two snakes "cuddle" like that it's not actually because they are friends but because they tolerate eachother and both want to use the same space because it's safe there or a good basking area. I would imagine it is the same for amphibians. I think we only assume they have a bond is because we think like a human.

Now let's counter with the very next coming up inquiry raised, as to how the card games came into existence or what is the narration concerned to it? The story goes like this that the cards are said to be given birth initially in China, the country which boasts of an awesome invention of paper as well. And when this happened is also an important point to be pondered on as the same was brought into the picture as early as in the 7th or 10th century. And it is not that the use of card games was confined to that period only as still there are packs available in China in which there is a violent use of suits of coins and cords of coins which the players of Mah Jong term as circles and bamboos (known by us as sticks).
