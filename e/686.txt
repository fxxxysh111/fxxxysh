Yeah, on the surface it has a silly title and premise, but this is a strange, worthy movie starring some very talented actors. It starts out serious, as Walter Black (Gibson) is depressed with his toy company going bankrupt and marriage failing. He moves into a hotel and attempts suicide but isn't successful. Stuck in life, he decides to communicate with people using a beaver hand puppet, something he tells his wife is part of a therapy program. Walter reconnects with his youngest son thanks to the beaver and his wife can't help but empathize. But his elder boy (Yelchin) still won't accept him and Walter runs into other problems trying to win him over. This is a dramatic film with a light touch you'll be surprised is so watchable.

Any pair beats a non pair. (edit) Before the flop the pair of threes win because a pair is better than a high card. Its pretty much luck and either hand is fine. In the long run you would want threes every time, and you,d make .02% profit, but that amount of hands isn't possible and the profit is negligible. This of course doesn't include fold equity, along with many other factors. To put it into simple terms, If you have AQ and you know your opponent has 33. if the question was AQ or 99 or something the math is pretty similar but it changes the second part of my analysis a little. So in the AQ to 33 scenario.33 is statistically better, but I would take AQ 10 times out of 10. (Full Answer)

Its fine saying you want to keep bluffs in but its a board that typically connects well with the btn flatting range and utg bet into 2 people and then called a 3bet with someone still to act so there arent really any pure air combos for either of these guys and most of their non nutted made hands (T9/sets/QJ where the only T9 are the suited combos + btn doesnt have any of the sets and UTG can only have QQ) are gonna be super strong draws like AKss/KTss/97ss/KTdd etc., tbh i think 3 ways with roughly a psb behind in whats already a large pot id just make sure we realise all our equity and take any river guesswork out of it and jam turn. i mean especially since we probably get called by some stuff we crush like QJ and the stronger draws can ez just level themselves into calling aswell.

All told, this was a very good piece of thinking, especially referencing the estimates of Niels 30 years later, publishing in the Philosophical Magazine (volume 26, pp 1 25, 1913) and calculating the size of an atom at .5 x  10 And even though Thomson is talking his estimates in terms opf science in a post Dalton and post Mendeleyeev world, he is also pre Stoney, and Roentgen and Curie and Soddy and everyone else, especially pre atomic nucleus, and pre proton (1919/20 with Rutherford and Moseley) and pre neutron (Chadwick 1932), which are smaller still than the atom. Way smaller. Is difficult to put into understandable terms on how "small" that small is: atomic nucleus is sort of 1/10,000th of the atom, and a proton or neutron smaller still, and then the quark smaller than that, until perhaps it becomes a Seussian exercise with future discoveries showing that after everything is said and done that it is turtles all the way down.

If races were real, then they would kinda sorta be like animal breeds. That is, if you take two random, living, purebred individuals of breed A, call them A1 and A2, and one random, living, etc individual of breed B, then you are guaranteed that A1 and A2 are more closely related to each other than either one is to B. And the reason that is so is because breeds were purposefully engineered.

Unlike a physical casino where it would be nearly impossible to play multiple tables at once, most online poker rooms allow this. Depending on the site, a player might play from 4 to 10 tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, a player may make around $10 per 100 hands at a lower limit game.

So. I was maybe 5 or so. My sister is 2 years older than me so 7ish. My parents were on vacation for the week and left us with my aunt. It was during the winter and not Christmas vacation yet so we still had to go to school, but the deal was as soon as we got home from school we would go tobogganing (Canada!) down the hill behind our house. Well. My sister came down with some sickness I can remember which and ended up staying home from school. I still had to go. So the school bell rings and I catch the bus and little five year old me is just vibrating from excitement for today after school activity. I get off the bus and run home and burst through the door. Just in time to see my red faced aunt and sister taking off their wet snow suits after an afternoon of tobogganing without me. I still am and will probably forever be bitter about that bullshit.
So you saying it better that we have zero consumer protections and allow ISPs to do whatever they want and charge anything, with no competition (because that basically what America ISPs have become) and let them do it because they will anyway?

This has happened to me since I was a kid. It first happened when I was rolling on a bed as a kid and my knee got bent up to my chest in a weird angle and it hurts until you extend your leg and it pops back in right? It's weird to say but it's a way of moving that you gotta get used to you gotta have your legs flexed like bare minimum even when your weight is on them and there your knees are getting rolled in weird ways you can't just let your weight rag doll your knees or it'll keep happening. Eventually whatever muscles those are you get used to it and it'll be just how you move but I had to do it consistently for it to go away in athletics in highschool.

That a big assumption, though, I have no idea what the current state of those specters is and I would not be at all surprised to learn they were nerfed into the ground.

Look at the chip pattern for clues. One reason why it's a good idea to practice with different colored chips is that it makes it easier to tell when something is going wrong with your shuffle. When done properly, your shuffled chips should alternate between the two colors. If you see two or more of the same color next to each other in the stack, you should reevaluate your technique. If there is a general lack of interlacing, you can try working on couple aspects of your shuffle:

Repeat offenders are created out of removing a person from society from an extended amount of time, and then not providing them with the tools to reintegrate with society upon release. The finish their sentence and walk out the door with nothing. No money, no further education, no work skills. And they be lucky to find a job willing to hire them due to their history of incarceration. Which is another problem created by the demonization of criminals in society, regardless of their crimes. It doesnt matter if they murdered someone or if they happened to have weed on them at the wrong time. Society treats them just the same.

You can see why this is so from the example: Where the two players had All In EVs ranging from  $0.13 to $3.13, one player had to win a whole stack, while the other player had to lose a whole stack. And so, over a sample of one hand   the shortest term   these stats will fail to converge.

Not much of a secret as it hit the news but probably not known outside Nova Scotia. About 10 years ago a little girl went missing and her mother reported it, even going on the news asking for her daughter to return. A week or so later her body was found and the whole town mourned, leaving teddy bears where her body was found. It was discovered that the mother murdered her because she didn't want her new bf to leave her as he didn't want kids. I was living in a different province during the time but when I came back that was all people were talking about. I remember the cover of the local paper having an article about it saying the girl pleaded with her mother to stop before she was smothered with a pillow.

Another interesting thing to note about poker chips is that they sound differently. Expert poker players and/or poker chip tricks masters have their own preferences of chips.

An estimated 1 billion people worldwide, across all ethnicities and age groups, have a vitamin D deficiency.[1 3] This is mostly attributable to people getting less sun exposure because of climate, lifestyle, and concerns about skin cancer. The 1997 Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) values for vitamin D, initially established to prevent rickets and osteomalacia, are considered too low by many experts.[4] DRI values are 200 IU for infants, children, adults up to age 50 years, and pregnant and lactating women; 400 IU for adults aged 50 to 70 years; and 600 IU for adults older than 70 years. Current studies suggest that we may need more vitamin D than presently recommended to prevent chronic disease.

Combine ingredients. Use as a general massage oil or over specific areas of the body that tend to develop physical problems.

Once she is comfortable with being dilated, slowly start to move your finger in and out and around. Gently stretch her anus by pushing outward on her anal ring, as if it was the center of a clock face, pressing out towards 1, 2, 3 o etc. Once she has learned to enjoy the insertion of a single finger, try inserting a second. Always go very slowly and be sure she remains relaxed. Don forget to use lube on each finger you insert.

You can argue against their personal choices as though you know what best for them, because the immigrants are still living a better life here than they would be had they stayed where they were escaping from, otherwise they would never have left

Paying $60 for this game, in my eyes, is not worth it. Trust me. I REALLY enjoy the game, and I see the potential is there. I just wish the game would get some REAL sustaining content. I sure it been said over, and over, and over before. But honestly, the only thing to spend money on is, rather lame, cosmetics. Plus the only cool cosmetics come after a huge grind of getting to PL to do Athenas. And that just a big downside to this awesomely cool sandbox game.

I also met a real hot Chinese girl. Absolute model quality. Beautiful small face, slender, big tits, and surprisingly an awesome bubble butt. Best of all, very sweet voice and personality. Fucked her on her period, no condom and came inside her. Only 800 (hundred). Wish I could see her again but not to be. they are some combination of ugly ass goblins and deep voice and brash talking style. Really lost a diamond here. Oh well.
Then she went to her parents house, where she showered and changed into her cream suit.

Neither placental detachment nor miscarriage has ever been linked to prenatal massage in any scientific research. Most experts believe the reason why some massage therapists stay away, especially during the first trimester, and some doctors don't recommend it has to do with liability fears. Miscarriages are so common in the first 12 weeks that people who could possibly be considered legally liable   like someone who had her hands on the pregnant woman's belly before the miscarriage or someone who recommended that contact   simply (and perhaps wisely) decide to avoid any possible perception of causal effect that could lead to a lawsuit.. 
I mean, yes, I am a sucker for the feeling of someone who be there for you and love you no matter what, and I do eventually want to be in a relationship. The thing is, it takes so much effort to actively look for your someone, and I too tired from putting so much effort into everything else. I hope I don blow it if I find someone, but I pretty happy to be independent and just put my all into my life as it is.

Looking back, kid psych experts, school counselors now say that most of the last peak in teen suicide was kids trying to choke while they beat off. Their folks would find them, a towel twisted around the kid neck, the towel tied to the rod in their bedroom closet, the kid dead. Dead sperm everywhere. Of course the folks cleaned up. They put some pants on their kid. They made it look better. Intentional at least. The regular kind of sad, teen suicide.

The hubris of Empire is that we truly and really believe that the way we do things is the most evolved way and thus all the world wishes to be like us. Missed the part that while we were living out a John Wayne fantasy of liberating the Russkis from the Commies, the Russian government and people were writing something far more like Dostoevsky "The Brothers Karamazov." the scene where the Grand Inquisitor is speaking with Jesus Christ who has returned to save the people? they talk the Inquisitor   who is Russia   explains to Jesus   who is the US   that it is truly the Inquisitor who cares about the people since what the people really want is an easy set of rules to follow in this life, not some impossible set of standards to ascend into Heaven in the hereafter. Some point, Jesus/the US understands that his righteousness is not really what the masses need and he kisses the Grand Inquisitor to show that he understands the error of his ways..

Because handguns are easier to use, easy to conseal, lightweight, you can more easily find compatible ammo, magazines, and even carry several magazines in your pockets, they are very easy to reload quickly, and many have as many bullets in a mag as a legal rifle magazine. Also anyone who says that dual weilding pistols is impossible or even all that impractical is wrong. They are more accurate that one would think, easy to fix in the field, easier to suppress with items simply found around us, they are often not as loud as a rifle, and certainly quieter than a shotgun, they do not have a short range, they are honestly harder to fumble or drop, less recoil means faster refire while retaining a general ammount of accuracy, and 9mm (the most common pistol round) can penetrate most surfaces at close range. This is all assuming that we talking about a glock or M9. Magnums, revolvers, and other large round handguns are also common (though significantly less than say a glock), a 44. Round is strong enough that a shot to the chest comes with enough force to throw you on the ground like youve been shoved by someone twice your size, for comparison, a 9mm feels like a hard punch, six of these can be held in some revolvers, and can cause fatal trauma in a single shot to most areas of the torso, there are also semi automatic handguns that fire this round. There are also automatic handguns, magazines can have all manner of sizes of extended magazine, which, are difficult to aquire, though not impossible, and often the largest pistol magazines hold more than a rifle magazine.
I with you on most of it, but as far as plots go. I don think Tournament Arcs are good plots. A series of fights that exists because the character decides he wants to have a series of fights is a solid spectacle, but not actually deep or compelling.

What we are facing is a bankruptcy of ideas, a governing class   covering the political and military spectrum   that can't ask the right questions and therefore is in no position to get the right answers.

You can really ask the employer to quit or put their own job on hold to take care of the household.
