I believe that in some parts of the US you can live on much less for the same lifestyle, but not in the major cities. And I know rural Indiana is a fine place to live, but a civilization historically requires things like universities, business hubs, large corporation headquarters, arts culture, etc. If we all moved away from cities to rural property we quickly lose the ability to make major positive innovations to our society. 
I stayed in the center of the city and believe me it was to crowded and more expensive. This hotel is around coffee shops, retail shopping, restaurants etc etc. 
The Theon Cross album is hands down my AOTY so far. He plays tuba in Sons of Kemet, so if you listened to them that will give you an idea of what his playing sounds like. The album almost feels like jazz musicians making electronic music, the tuba has a great low end, the drums played by Moses Boyd are straight in the pocket and he uses a lot of four on the floor type beats, and the sax playing by Nubiya Garcia creates some nice melodic lines on top. Highly recommend the album

I would strongly recommend keeping at least one American bank account open, although I don know about citi in particular. Having an American account which you can use to pay American bills is still useful, even if you earn and spend your money in Japan. If you have American credit cards, you still need something to make your payments on those, and if you don you probably should apply for some and at least build a credit history. If you travel outside of Japan again at any point in the future, it much easier to get American credit cards without foreign transaction fees than Japanese cards. downloadable media, subscriptions, educational services). If you be saving any money, you want to weigh the pros and cons of Japanese vs. American investments (assuming you a US citizen, there are tax/reporting requirements for many foreign accounts). With low cost transfers such as TransferWise, it can be cheaper to pay to convert your Japanese income back into US dollars and use them to pay/invest (especially if you paying with a card that has no foreign transaction fees but gives cashback/points) than to pay/invest in Japanese accounts with their fees.

A cash game, otherwise known as a "ring game" is a form of pokerwith no fixed start or end time. Cash games are rather permanenttables where players can come as go as they please. These gameshave a buy in minimum (and maximum at no limits): the player mustbring at least this much money to the table. You getchips equal to your buy in. For instance you buy in for 500$, youget 500$ worth of chips while you can also choose to buy in formore money or less money. The amount of chips on the table equalsthe amount of money you are playing with. A tournament is a structured competition with a fixed startingpoint and completion when only one person remains. The tournamentshave an entrance fee. Once paid that entitles the person to takepart in the tournament. As soon as their chips are depleted theyare out of the tournament In tournament poker you "Buy In" (pay to participate in thetournament) for a set amount of money. In a tournament every playerpays the same amount of money to participate. For your buy in youreceive a set amount of chips depending on the tournament. Everyplayer who buys into the tournament gets the same amount of chips. (Full Answer)

The rule varies by room. In cash games, most casinos in Las Vegas don't require you to show until the hand is complete. If the other player shows his hand and you cannot beat him, you can generally just throw your hand away without showing. However, there is an even more confusing rule that allows any player to request to see your hand, and most rooms will show it if anyone asks. The rule was originally to prevent collusion, but in all but a few rooms, you can ask to see any hand that was live at showdown without accusing anyone of anything. It does create hard feelings and is sometimes considered rude.

There a lot you miss but I think they do that on purpose, to encourage you to go back and check the other stuff out. All of the games so far have received some kind of re release to make them more accessible to a wider audience. KHUX is a remake/sequel already to KHX, but I expect them to make the story more accessible at some point in the future.
Agreed. In fact, I don think we make the distinction clear enough. In a capitalist framework, these companies should be allowed to do this. They actively and loudly defend a resturant right to not serve black people, as if they just following their principles to their logical conclusion, but then won make a peep about Valve right to keep content off their platform. Almost as if this wasn a principled stance to begin with, and is just a ploy to bring back segregation.

When it comes to Elder Scrolls or Fallout they can more likely get away with a shorter marketing campaign. Keep in mind that is still new even for BGS. They just kind of have two examples of how it plays out with a BGS title. Those examples are Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. With Fallout 4, they didn need to really turn up the hype over time and everyone was already very familiar with a BGS Fallout game. That short release window was perfect for them and they had a lot of good will and trust from gamers at the time. There were even a lot of people who had no problems with BGS first introducing a DLC Pass and pre saling it. Everyone figured it would be more than worth it in the end and the pass was only 30 bucks at first before they raised it after giving everyone about a month notice. With Fallout 76, the short release widow didn work out so well for BGS. Those I suppose people could argue it did based on the fact more people were "tricked" into buying it due to hype.

As for the video, how can you tell he fucking around? He blurs the line between comedy and his personal opinions, right? And we don know his political beliefs, so how can you confidently say he fucking around? And I don care if he is or isn it doesn matter. I brought up that point because you claimed that "Calling people names or identifying them as such and such without substantial proof isn really a good look and says a lot about your actions as well."

There were other Norse ship types that had decks, or at least a small half deck that could shelter a bit of the crew or cargo. The knarr is the most famous type of this ship, and was used during the "Viking expansion" era to carry cargo or larger groups of people from place to place than the longship could.

Turn I hesitant to comment. I don have a lot of small bets in my turn range even though I know PIO likes them in a lot of spots like this where the A peels off on the turn. I have a hard enough time executing 2/3 accurately. I will say this hand and JQs should for sure be barreling turn. Because of my lack of study I lean to betting 2/3 here so we can more reasonably over bet jam river with some of our range. As you mention we have a lot of Kx and Ax when we range bet flop so we definitely have a sizable value region to balance. JTs and JQs not only have equity by drawing to essentially the nuts, they also block our opponents strongest Ax and Kx which make them great candidates to triple off.

The third option is that Pirate is intentionally misleading us, dropping hints that lead to more than one character, but "look" most like the wrong character, allowing readers to look at the story with fresh light after they realize the true state of affairs.

Let look at villain range here: His KK should 3bet pre most of the time so I not worried about that. He definitely has all the combos of AQ, which is the main hand we worried about but I think AQ should 3bet a non 0 % of the time. He could also have Q9s.

His semi bluffs consist of nut flush draws, open ended straight draws, and pairs+open enders, and some Q high flush draws as well. I think against this range we not loving life but have enough equity to stack off.

In fact the only thing you have to worry about is a power failure, and even then your money is still safe, because its linked to an account that only you have the username and password (unless you are married, then you might have to worry about your spouse)If you are like me, and you just can't afford to hop on a plane every night and fly to Las Vegas or Atlantic City, or wherever your nearest casino is, online video poker is the perfect solution.

An estimated 1 billion people worldwide, across all ethnicities and age groups, have a vitamin D deficiency.[1 3] This is mostly attributable to people getting less sun exposure because of climate, lifestyle, and concerns about skin cancer. The 1997 Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) values for vitamin D, initially established to prevent rickets and osteomalacia, are considered too low by many experts.[4] DRI values are 200 IU for infants, children, adults up to age 50 years, and pregnant and lactating women; 400 IU for adults aged 50 to 70 years; and 600 IU for adults older than 70 years. Current studies suggest that we may need more vitamin D than presently recommended to prevent chronic disease.

So? Our WW1 veterans are all dead that doesn mean we shouldn cares about WW1. Our WW2 veterans and survivors are dying out and will be gone within the next decade, that doesn mean we won still care about the holocaust. We need to remember these injustices.

There a progression of thinking that The Wall the best album then thinking Animals or Meddle is the best album because the Wall is too obvious and too over the top then thinking that Piper at The Gates of Dawn is the best album because Syd Barret was such a genuis but in the end you ultimately realize that The Wall is the best album.

If you can't put together a team from early tryouts that even have a shot at regionals or a shot at nationals, and you don't like it for the team dynamics and working hard for each other, then look for a more competitive team and find ways to expand your skills to make a better team. You paid ALL THIS MONEY to the USAU, but those cats have paid exponentially more than you to the USAU and the former UPA before it than you have. and they paid the same as you to compete. Good on Babymaker, and long live Haymaker and Pacemaker for an amazing program.

If it happens too frequently, or they lash out at you, then you need to get out of the relationship right away. If you try to date others, they may follow you or threaten your new date. More often than not, a loser is living on credit. I am dependent on others for my happiness.

I am not defending Whole Food. I personally can stand the store and think 90% of what they have is over priced and can be found elsewhere for a lot less, but I am saying that the hours you give your employees and the money you pay them makes a significant difference in the service your customers get, which goes beyond just ringing up your groceries.. 
Seated Overhead Press: Sit on the ball with correct posture (stomach tight, shoulders back, head up, back straight, and hips directly beneath you) and push a weight from shoulder level to above your head. Your back should stay flat during the movement and if you have to significantly increase the curve in your low back, you are using too much weight. The benefit of using an exercise ball is that your abdominals and back muscles will activate to keep the spine in a neutral position while the lower body muscles work to keep your hips stationary.

R4: (at 3:29) The creator of this video makes the bold claim that second person pronoun "you" derives from a misspelling by german printing presses of the word "thou/ou" because they did not have the appropriate letter for thorn and had substituted it with "y", hence "ou > you" which "was kept [.] in pronunciation for some reason" (their words). They make reference for "ye" in "ye olde" as an example of this and while this indeed the case for the definite article in "Ye Olde", this is only true for speakers of Modern English due to its anachronistic use in culture and language. This is not the case for "you", which in fact, is the oblique form of the archaic nominative, plural, second person pronoun "ye" and, as with many European languages of the time, plural personal pronouns were considered more polite and formal, while "thou" the singular pronoun, was considered informal and familiar.

Utah (11 P5 wins), Clemson (11 P5 wins), Baylor (9 P5 wins), OSU (10 P5 wins), and LSU (10 P5 wins). I would easily leave Baylor out because it doesn matter that they put up 70 on Rice and Kansas, their schedule doesn come close. And I can guarantee you that if UCLA wins out the rest of the year and wins the PAC 12 I would put them in the playoffs over an undefeated Baylor..

In his Financial Times blog, Paul Murphy said after the Cypriot finance minister, Michael Sarris, returned empty handed from Moscow: "Medvedev and co could not have played a worse hand during this crisis   and it's not immediately clear why." His point is that the most likely outcome right now   he calls it "popping the red pill"   is that big depositors at Laiki Bank (read: Rich Russians) are likely to lose some 40% of their money. Since that will make Russia very unhappy, why is Russia doing nothing to prevent it?

Remember that the bet following/on the river (the 5th community card) is the most important. This one must be powerful and intimidating. When the opponent checks, and then it comes to you, you can place a large bet to get the opponent to call or fold. If a player bets in front of you, there are two things you can do. If s/he bets small, your making a significantly larger bet might push him/her to fold. However, if the opponent makes a large, bluff like bet, your best chance to bluff would be to call (less risk)   or go all in, especially if you have a lot more chips than the other player. Consider, it is better to push all in by betting than by calling, since you want to look strong to have more impact. The best feeling in poker is deciding someone is bluffing and taking down a large pot with a bluff of your own, causing the first bluffer to fold, and no one ever knows whether either or both of you were bluffing.
