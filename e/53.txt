Whether or not you're a fan of Nancy Meyers, there is one undeniable thread to her work: she makes compassionate films about men and women feeling vulnerable and, even more so, men and women feeling vulnerable out loud and with one another. There is a reason that she, similar to the late Nora Ephron, has come to be synonymous with a category of filmmaking historically associated with female audiences: she paints the women and men of her films with the same brush, however broad. She makes space for stories that centre women (albeit, mostly white women) and the ways in which their feelings and experiences shape their relationships with men   and, importantly, other women   around them.

Although it may seem a little excessive, there are a couple of reasons why you might benefit from using separate creams for your hands and cuticles. We may not always recognize their importance, but cuticles are unique and serve a specific function: They help to protect and nourish our nails as they grow. When your cuticles dry out, they lose the natural fats that usually keep them soft. Your nail plate also becomes less flexible, and your nails can become more brittle and susceptible to damage [source: Gallant]. Cuticle creams keep that from happening by replacing the natural fats you lose with other fats and waxes such as lanolin, petroleum and beeswax [source: Milady]. Chances are your hand cream won't contain the same mix of ingredients or be quite as oily.

Eliashberg: If you look at the nominees, the movie Bohemian Rhapsody has made quite a bit of money, I believe around $200 million. A Star Is Born also made quite a bit of money, also around $200 million. I not sure how much of a gain they will have as a result of winning the Oscar.

It is a typical example of casino bonus on the first deposit. The sizes of a deposit and bonus can be different, as well as the required stake rates, but one thing remains unchangeable   the amount of the casino bonus is accessible for withdrawal after the required wager.

Aluminum building wiring is a type of electrical wiring for residential construction or houses that uses aluminum electrical conductors. Aluminum provides a better conductivity to weight ratio than copper, and therefore is also used for wiring power grids, including overhead power transmission lines and local power distribution lines, as well as for power wiring of some airplanes.[1][2] Utility companies have used aluminum wire for electrical transmission in power grids since around the late 1800s to the early 1900s. It has cost and weight advantages over copper wires.

Certainly a variety of academic bodies of thought came together during those years (marxism, feminism, queer theory, critical race theory) to thoroughly question any and all claims to objectivity. According to most of this analysis, "objectivity" is a claim by those who need not be aware of their positions in the social world (in other words, those not marked by race, gender, sexuality, or class  that is, straight, white, monied men). 
But there are guys who hug their wives and children and think "I shouldn be here, Davis should have made it not me, it wasn his turn to be a gunner but I was tired so he took my shift and let me rest." These guys deal with this shit all day, and their families will NEVER understand. or at least that what we all think. The stuff some service members did to survive are things they will never share with their spouses. How could you look your wife in the eye and say "I should be dead, I think about Davis and how he died." Or "I killed a boy who was around the same age as our daughter, I thought he had a gun and it was my first raid so I shot because I was scared."

That's good to hear you have help at least with some of the parts the house. I suppose then the big thing is managing expectations around the housework, remember you don't need to be the employee of the month, perfect mother and best homemaker. Realize that you are a working mother being a homemaker isn't always possible, you also have a partner to help with parenting. I grew up with parents working full time 45+ hours a week, stress, and a permanently messy house and that is ok doing ok is definitely good enough. As long as your house is full of love it doesn't need to be immaculately clean just have to the minimum standard you are ok with (I guaranty it'll be higher than most). You are awesome working hard, dealing with anxiety and raising kids you need to give yourself some credit and realize there's no need to be perfect just do your best and it's more than enough. Take time for you as well maybe yourself and your husband could alternate Saturday for a Daddy's weekend or mammys weekend where one parent takes a day to themselves?

Perhaps the most studied effect concerns the shade association with desire, seduction, and sin a link that can be seen in everything from the Scarlet Whore of Babylon to Chris de Burgh Lady in Red. A string of experiments, by Elliot and other colleagues, have all confirmed that men and women are both rated as being more attractive when wearing red compared to other shades. Although many of the studies were conducted in the laboratory, with subjects passively rating static photos, it also seems to translate to real world behaviour; waitresses in red also tend to get bigger tips from male customers, for instance; wearing a red t shirt can also increase female hitchhikers chances of getting a ride.

There are probably aspects of control / government power / censorship of ideas at some level. But I recall the initial censorship started back when there were all these kids and men who would get online and gamble until their eyes fell out or they were broke. And young guys would spend days looking at porn, to the point they would never leave the PC room. Self indulgence to an unhealthy level. Parents were unable to stop them, wives were unable to stop them, and they could not stop themselves. Confucianism, history of totalitarianism, miseducation, Korean democracy being in its infancy, hierarchical social structure, etc. In my opinion, it is because Koreans have never fought and won their own independence. Koreans don understand the concept of freedom of speech and press since the current democratic administration was handed down to them after the Japanese surrender. Even the Korean war was won by America, not the Koreans. America fought a war against the British and won their independence. The French had their revolution and the bourgeoisie chopped all the heads off the monarchs and aristocrats. Even China and Russia, their communist revolutionaries fought for decades before succeeding in their fight for control of their countries. Korea doesn have a history of fighting for democracy and succeeding. There have been independence fighters, demonstrations, etc. but none were successful and brought a clear victory to the Korean people. Therefore, democratic ideals that you see in western societies do not exist here.

It was confusing to figure out.The reason we use the ranked choice system for some questions is that we want to make sure people have the chance to pick from a variety of options, rather than having to pick between just two when the situation (and people preferences) are more complex.

You're not crazy! The cramps should go away soon. When I had my Skyla inserted, I thought I was going to die for a couple days, and then it started getting better. As for the mood   this can definitely be an effect of any hormonal birth control. Sometimes it balances out after a while, sometimes it doesn't. I'd say to give the cramps a week or so and if they don't at least start improving, see your doc. The mood I've always heard to give 3 months to balance out. Of course, if you decide it's too much to handle and you can't bear it and wait it out, that's fine too! I'm just telling you what I would do in the same situation.

If the government provides no unemployment benefit and you put away 4% of your salary into a bank account in case you lose your job, that is wealth. However, if you lose your job, the 4% of your income that you put away might not cover expenses as well as the 2% the government has put away from everyone to spread the risk over more people.

There probably no pattern here, you don mention a smoking gun, and given that it a minimum wage job, there probably not enough in potential recovery here to make it worth taking this to court as a practical matter, even if you do have the minimum you need to file a lawsuit. 6 points  submitted 1 day ago

There are also things just about myself that I don think my partner of 5 years really needs to know about. My best friend might think it funny to hear that I pooped 5 times before lunch and all of them burned because I asked for double jalapenos on my burger. but my boyf probably still wants to get a boner when I wear a lace thong rather than pondering over my mid day mudbutt.

Using C++ and i5 CPU I personally get about 4.4 million hands/s in Monte Carlo with 3 players and 2.3 million with 6 players. But that's just raw unoptimized Monte Carlo. Brute force enumeration goes at the rate of 190M hands/sec. So your 205,476,480 boards don't look too scary to me. This number is actually wrong: you should have calculated it as combin(48,5) = 1,712,304. At 190M/sec that's an instant. So I can assume that the bottleneck is hand evaluation algorithm.

Never price enforce: If you don't want a player and he's not in your plans, don't draft him just because you think he's a cant miss bargain. It doesn't matter if you value Catcher X at $20 and you can get him for $18 if your plan calls for spending way down at catcher. Price enforcing at $18 will be a headache as you try to come up with a new plan (unless, of course, $18 on a catcher was Plan B as described above, but we assume you get that). While the occasional fantasy baseball player can win in that kind of chaos, they are few and far between. We won LABR, Tout Wars and FSTA in 2018, and we do not believe we can be effective in such an environment.

Because I feared with Allied races, that they are introduced and then shoved to the background. These are new ways to introduce new perspectives on the war and their interaction with their respective factions.

Hope this isn't too late, and I'm not from Manhattan. I would first look into the other kind of "game shops", the billiard kind. The ones that would specialize in selling pool tables, cues, darts boards. I've seen poker tables in stores like this, so I would assume they would heave the nice chips.

The problem was Nazi ideology. Communism and Nazi ideology do not mesh at all. Communists are untermensch. And so were the Slavic people that made up the USSR and the countries that the USSR wanted to reclaim. So you can be allies with these people, and you can let their ideologies and genes spread into your ideal society. Besides, they all up in your living space or whatever the Germans wanted. Attacking the USSR was a necessity, and the opportunity was ripe, because you have an ally to open up the Eastern front on the USSR after your initial attack, and get to attack an army at half strength.
That said, the original judge's ruling at the trial level wrongly characterized the issue as a fundamental right, and thus I think missed the boat when it came to Strickland prejudice. It's been a while since I read it, but that's what I recall.

That said, it possible she has her work permit now depending when they got married and if they filed their paperwork, I guess. Some people have guessed she really came in on a spousal visa, not a K1. I think with a CR1 visa, you can work immediately as soon as you receive your SSN. So, if that is the way she entered the country, she could legally be working. Who the hell knows what she up to. I don think any company (other than the snake lady company) wants to be associated with her brand of crazy.

And yet there is no hard evidence that Trump himself knew about the meetings or that ANYTHING on substance was exchanged at said meetings.

"As an openly LGBTQ person, I have always felt included at our office, but formalizing our efforts through the Pride Network made our work environment all the more inclusive.

It's a visual recognition that inclusion extends to the physical space and that we want our space to be welcoming to all staff and visitors."
