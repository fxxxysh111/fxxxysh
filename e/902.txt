I agree with everything else you said but this is often not true. My city had a huge bust of these parlours recently, and one of my friends had gone to one regularly and bought their mom a gift cert to go, they had no idea and were shocked. A lot of these places do operate on the down low..

Another easy hip flexor stretch is to bend one leg at the waist and knee and rest your lower leg on a chair, while allowing the straight leg to gently stretch for 20 min.

To be fair, it not exclusive to k pop. Most k pop fans come from the One Direction and other boybands fandoms and it was already that random and weird back in 2010. Now since all those bands are nowhere to be found most fans have migrated to k pop so that why we get the shorter end of the stick. 
This is purely a discussion on the protein needs the planet would have if it depended on soy instead of meat and, as stated before, even more plant based protein would have to be consumed to make sure the population gets all 9 amino acids (a complete protein diet). 
First as a parent to a teenager, my 13 yo daughter is really distant with her favorite aunt. They were always super close but now she just plays on her phone or computer when we visit. We ended up dropping her off at home so we could actually enjoy our afternoon last time we were all hanging out, just a couple of years ago she was begging to visit them. I know it sucks but I also think it is fairly normal for this age. Teenagers suck a lot of the time especially with toxic behavior being modeled by your parents.

I don think Sara pushy at all. I don much care for her, but I don see her as being pushy.

Lavoisier did not discover oxygen, but he figured out that it was the gas that combined with substances as they burned. Lavoisier thereby did away with the prevailing phlogiston theory and paved the way for the development of modern chemistry. It was a much safer revolution for Lavoisier than the political one that soon followed in France, so revolutionary that Lavoisier lost his head over it.

People are not going to learn what is offensive and why if no one tells them. One can say " It not my job to educate them!!" And while that statement may be true, the anger and fury that result from ignorance breeds more anger and hate. Educating one another has much potential to stop the cycle of hate and anger.

I have yet to meet my significant other, and I graduated from college nearly two years ago. I know this doesn exactly answer your question, but I think the greater issue is the importance you seem to be placing on finding a mate at all. Things unfold naturally and exactly as they should, and the sooner you let that sink through your skull, the better off you will be. I actually stayed in an unhealthy relationship for several months after graduation because I thought giving that up would be resigning to failure and a life without love. But in the weeks leading up to that breakup, I realized how much I meant to myself, and that even if I were to spend an indeterminate amount of time without a mate, I would find fulfillment in other areas of my life. It true, meeting new people after college gets more difficult, but it by no means impossible. It might require a little more effort, but it always possible. And I always heard that you meet the love of your life when you least expect it. I don personally have any evidence of that (yet!), but I more than willing to believe it true. So just slow down, enjoy the ride, and relish the time you have to yourself and the time you have left in college. You only get this once.
Talk to him about what you struggling with. 
My buddy Matt once got into a 50 hour long heads up (one on one) match with another pro. Well, the other guy took Matt for over $70,000, at which point Matt decided to take a break from poker for a few months. When I commiserated and pointed out that taking a break was probably a good idea after such a big loss, Matt replied that it wasn't about the money. He didn't give a shit that he lost $70K. What he cared about was that he got outplayed for 50 hours straight. And that's why he was taking a break. Because, due to variance, what matters in the long run is how well you play, not how much you win or lose in any given session.

I definitely think it still possible, as personality does not dictate one life (and of course, the validity of MBTI is a bit awry), but I can definitely see how an ENTP female would have a ton of issues fitting into the RPW mold.RPW is probably most ideal for the XXFJ types, INFP, and maybe ENFP (ESFP as well if she can hone in attention seeking behaviors). 
And I don agree that she more of POC than Caelynn. Caucasian Iranians might be "othered" because of Islamophobia, and that real bigotry, but being othered doesn mean having the experience of a POC. A Muslim Caucasian Iranian person can hide their religious affiliations and change their name to avoid being "othered" in the US in a way that women like Rachel and Kirpa cannot.

For sure it is too many. When you move to a large number of tables, you should expect some degradation of results because of lower concentration.

In February 1944, he was back inside again, this time at Elmira State Reformatory, starting another five years for the same kind of crime. He came out again, and seemed to either get somewhat improved at his job, or gave crime away, for the time being at least. The cops in New York thought of Carmine as a peanut punk, the kind of hood who would probably never amount to much. He'd been arrested eight times, including the two that sent him away. Maybe it was in prison that like Joey Gallo, a man to whom he would be forever linked, Carmine DiBiase became a voracious reader devouring books by Flaubert, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Franz Kafka , among others.

I think that a bit of an exaggeration. There a lot of low grade wool out there, but that driven by high demand for wool/cashmere versus the wool production industry itself  which has not drastically altered production methods or sourcing to keep pace w/demand.

The amount of medication given 1 to 4 hours before the intervention was not significantly associated with pain levels immediately after or 1 hour after the massage session, but it was associated with a decrease in pain 2 hours after the intervention. This medication related decrease was significant for women (F(3,7) = 29.37, p = 0.002) but not for men (F(3,15) = 0.03, p = 0.87).The 6 studies of hypnosis found that there was a significant reduction in pain in the intervention groups.

A 43 year old real estate agent who paid to sleep with her pulled out a gun, she feared for her life, and she somehow was able to kill him first.Courts did not see this as being self defense, because she was also charged with prostitution, and that made her seem much less innocent, much less of a victim.They charged her as an adult and gave her a life sentence.

The current 52 card deck is often credited to European countries. In the fifteenth century, France introduced the current suits of clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades in a game called Poque. It is quite possible that the word "poker" is derived from that word. Others, however, claim that the word "poker" comes from the German card game pochspiel or the German bluffing game pochen, which dates back to the sixteenth century. Also, the British are credited with the introduction of games called "Brag" and "Faro," which were played in many saloons in the Old West.

Representatives from 3 nations just had a summit of sorts at this small town where the adventurers explained what happened. The mostly human empire of Argos tried to belittle the events as a few fanatics committing terrorism. The Elven nation of the Gold Valley is taking these threats very seriously and advises caution. They want to dig deeper into the ruins under Copperton but the town is on Argosian soil so they forbid it. The Dwarven city state of Iron Gate is confident that if there is some kind of Kraken threat they will be save deep underground in there fortress city. I have an idea that further investigation of the ruins will reveal that that they used to be a large castle until they resisted the kraken many (thousands?) of years ago and that the inhabitants were working on some kind of weapon or magic to overthrow it. The kraken laid waste to most of the castle and buried what remained as well as cursing the inhabitants to undeath but didn find whatever it is they were working on. What is something they could be working on that would be a legitimate threat to a beast of the Kraken magnitude?

Favorite stretch for the hip flexors is easy to perform without much chance of straining your low back. Before starting the stretch, pull one knee toward your chest to flatten and rotect your lower back. Then extend the other leg and let it hang for at least 2 min. Repeat with the other leg. Another easy hip flexor stretch is to bend one leg at the waist and knee and rest your lower leg on a chair, while allowing the straight leg to gently stretch for 20 min. To reduce pain in your glutes, lay on a tennis ball, bend your knee, and move your knee back and forth (with your heel staying still  see Left).

I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902 1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

I argue against two popular claims. The first is a descriptive, empirical thesis about the nature of ordinary human experience: 'each of us constructs and lives a "narrative" . . . this narrative is us, our identities' (Oliver Sacks); 'self is a perpetually rewritten story . . . in the end, we become the autobiographical narratives by which we "tell about" our lives' (Jerry Bruner); 'we are all virtuoso novelists. . . . We try to make all of our material cohere into a single good story. And that story is our autobiography. The chief fictional character . of that autobiography is one's self' (Dan Dennett). The second is a normative, ethical claim: we ought to live our lives narratively, or as a story; a 'basic condition of making sense of ourselves is that we grasp our lives in a narrative' and have an understanding of our lives 'as an unfolding story' (Charles Taylor). A person 'creates his identity [only] by forming an autobiographical narrative   a story of his life', and must be in possession of a full and 'explicit narrative [of his life] to develop fully as a person' (Marya Schechtman).

For example, when you give a "intubation dose" of propofol to a patient, bag mask them for a little bit, they wake up like 10 minutes later. The propofol hasn had time to be completely metabolized by the liver in 10 minutes, but it did have time to be redistributed to fatty tissues.If you give an anesthetic continuously for longer periods of time, you can actually build up a TON of anesthetic in your fatty tissues, and they will start leeching anesthetic back into your blood stream.Isoflurane is highly lipid soluble, and anesthesiologists know that if you give isoflurane continuously to an obese patient for a 10 hour case, they gonna have to wake the patient up in the ICU several hours after the surgery is over.

The sad thing is, Biden a smart guy and the Times readers are smart enough to engage in a real discussion and even defense of the Obama administration chosen path to economic recovery. After all, it is the NY Times columnist Paul Krugman who spends much of his column arguing that too much money was given to the banks and too little to recovery projects that directly benefit the people. If Biden disagrees with economists as respected as Krugman, then let him do so. That what Times readers deserve. Not political pablum served up with a side of propaganda.
Training] to me represents modern day yoga, exercises adapted to our current lifestyle where we sit at computers, drive in cars and predominantly lead sedentary lives  [The] postures resemble yoga positions and when I first saw the pictures of the exercises I incorrectly assumed these were modified yoga postures and that there was nothing new, just a reinvention of an ancient tradition. Within my first 60 seconds of my [session], I realized how wrong I was. These subtle variations in positioning that form the basis of the work completely alter the dynamics of the exercises and force the body to adapt, to use muscles we leave dormant, strengthening the body in just the areas of weakness that modern life generates.

I think especially as people with limited means we have to be even more ruthless about getting rid of stuff we don really need and enjoy, because I can tell you from first hand experience, it very easy to go "hoarder" mode.

I'm more or less in agreement with your conclusions here. As far as demographic shifts are concerned, I think the statistics you cited wrt second amendment sentiment is a symptom of the highly autocorrelated nature of political opinions, and thus their surveys.

As a result of changing business models, many Americans looked to the equity in their home as their 401K plans and the foundation for retirement. For many homeowners, equity equalled net worth. With that equity evaporating, and an inability to sell a home even at drastically reduced prices, lives have been so dramatically impacted financially, that a housing recovery, if and when it happens, may not really matter..

Therein lies the predicament, according to Masamichi Adachi, senior economist of JP Morgan Securities Japan. Root of the problem is that Japan has not been and is not able to adjust socially and economically to the shrinking and rapid aging of its population, and to the changing outside world environment, such as globalization, he suggests. Instead of launching the monetary easing and boosting spending at a time when Japan public debt is nearing 250% of its GDP, Abe should have immediately embarked on structural reforms and deregulation the kinds of tough changes needed to spur innovation and entrepreneurship, create new business opportunities and boost employment, says Adachi, who is also a former BOJ official.

Sure there's the luxury tax threshold which, dear me, you're penalized over dollars spent at 200m? Taxed at 40m when you go over for a consecutive year?

This happened right next to our house. I was out working with a tractor on the farm and we heard these huge snaps and a large rumbling sound. Then some trees went down. When we had gotten down next to it there was a meter of mud covering 30 feet across the drive way, and about 20 feet down was a massive torrent of mud, when I looked away the mud had deposited a huge bolder on the side, eventually the mud thinned out and water started washing down, erroded the sides and took the thing away. A friend of mines car has being seriously damaged and a tractor which is basically destroyed. My first reaction was to point out the superficial objections in some of the points you raised within it, but before I was able to hit the submit button. I really sat down and thought about it. Indeed, this post truly does go right to the heart of the matter. I am forced to reconsider my position. Indeed what you have said has raised poignant questions that I think all of us should confront. Questions we must ask ourselves. Who are we? What is our role in our nations. Can my nation truly be great while these questions remain open? I think not.

I don't need to google it. I know the risks from peer reviewed studies and have heard the complaints of patients who have experienced adverse effects in person. Your assertion that there is "almost never any need" for MRI contrast is absurd; it is essential for early detection of cancer and monitoring multiple sclerosis. The benefits to those patients affected by (or suspected of having) those diseases far outweigh the risks observed in a few dozen hypochondriacs like Chuck Norris' wife.

Sexually violent acts are committed daily by "civilized" men  on children, women, and yes, other men.

For comparison, let look at a post that actually fits the original spirit of that subreddit. This post currently at +1120 on the front page about the history of condoms, which is certainly extremely racist and offensive, is actually a joke.

Sportsbooks in Nevada have never offered wagers on the Oscars. The state has a long history of resisting wagering on non sporting events even explicitly banning bets on things like elections but opened up slightly in 2011 by allowing wagers on the World Series of Poker, the first event bets allowed on something beyond a traditional sport. A Nevada casino asked to offer the Oscars in 2012 but was denied. Over the last four years, Nevada regulators have allowed wagers on votes for things like Super Bowl MVP, the Heisman Trophy in college football and AL and NL MVP in baseball.
So, we've explained what the procedure looks like   assuming it was done properly. And as you could probably guess there are a lot of ways an amateur or first timer can get it wrong. It's different than most other car repairs because it's not about mechanical prowess; it's more about control and the ability to maintain a steady hand and a gentle pace. You can't rush it. The problem is, once a sheet metal repair starts to go awry, you're usually much, much worse off than if you'd just left it alone. Metal holds its shape, but only to a certain point.

Once you feel like you've got your answer see if you can identify a solution (I know it's obvious but sometimes the simplest solutions are the best). Joining a sports club or support group is a good way to be around people like you and your own age (I know you can sometimes feel like you just want to be alone but talking to people every once in a while might improve your condition).

How much time does it take to do like 10 PvAI trainer battles? Roughly 15 minutes? Seems commensurate.. 
No not everyone gets a green light on their behaviour   but as my very initial point stated: posting on a public forum, calling them names and making fun of their behaviour. IS NOT OKAY. It is immature and an ineffective method of solving this problem, which seems to be a huge issue for people..

Reports coming in from our highway forecasters traveling on roadways early this morning or doing mitigation work have stated: "there isn a piece of avalanche terrain that hasn slid." This is incredible, but shocking news given the impressive avalanche cycle over the past few days. This second round of heavy snowfall has put storm totals for March into historic levels. Combine these amounts with strong winds and we have some of the most dangerous avalanche conditions in years. Crews are out to keep the major roadways open, but further travel in or around avalanche terrain is not recommended. Even at lower elevations, a high rain line has increased the risk of wet avalanches. Under these exceptional conditions, expect all avalanche paths, both small and large to slide.

Not considering all the options left Obama with no choice but to continue Bush war.

The PPP's newly discovered addiction to this mutilated Constitution is not unexpected. Given the personal trials (undeserved), and political tribulations (deserved), that the president has gone through, his affinity for a souped up version of the presidency was entirely predictable. A mutilated Constitution that validates a hyper powerful presidency has meshed perfectly with the deeply insecure model of governance adopted by the president. When presidential spokespersons express indignation at the Kerry Lugar Bill outrage as being a proxy for opposition to the president they are simply living out the structural and contextual reality of the office of president in a Pakistan that is governed by a mutilated Constitution.

Describing the development of English statutory and common law, Blackstone emphasized the problem of constructive treasons, explaining how 25 Edward III was enacted to restrict constructive, or judge made treasons, and how the statute must therefore be "our text and guide". Prior to 25 Edward III, Blackstone writes, "there was a great latitude left in the breast of judges, to determine what was treason, or not so; whereby the creatures of tyrannical princes had opportunity to create abundance of constructive treasons, offenses into the crime and punishment of treason, which never were suspected to be such".

At the time that I joined the company, we were considered a niche vendor in the market research space within media and advertising.

This is well established terminology in the market research space, and they commonly still refer to this type of technology as automated facial coding.

Lawrence regards the legal issue as a red herring. In 35 years, neither she nor any of the surrogates she's used have faced legal trouble, probably because most legitimate surrogates do not advertise and work only with men sent to them by mental health professionals.

Probably the easiest way you can tell is simply by looking at his friends. Conversations center around him and a lot is suited on his past. The best approach is one that focuses on reaching for the deeper wisdom hiding somewhere within him. He will be hoping to find a woman who is emotionally mature and thinking about relationships seriously. I just needed to know that he did care, and did value me in his life, even just as a friend. When i first joined the team he was really jealous of me because i was very confident, very outspoken, had a lot of ideas and everybody loved my ideas.

Moreover what she did, she dishonestly and unfairly did to Bernie, who represents and has the backing of a large number of members who may very well agree with him, too, so he deserves to be heard and have that issue more thoroughly discussed and debated within the party, not swept under the carpet or getting swept out the door, himself, for it. This is what is known as adding insult to injury and another good reason why she should have been kicked out.

Enjoy the city. Especially if this is your first trip to Vegas, please don't spend all your time at the poker tables. There is so much to see and do here that you should definitely soak it in rather than play cards all day and night.

I appreciate them personally but more importantly, I know the the Core Team and the Volunteers do too and I was also relieved to see them turn into a discussion about the Hitchhiker film that didn't turn into a kicking! There have been threads sometimes in some places that has made me wince! I know some folks loved it, some not so much. 
With Rock Tape, I know you can use milk of magnesia applied to your skin before using the tape (learned this from a rep, but have not tried it since RX worked fine on its own for me). This is something you could cautiously try for other brands. I use magnesium oil for muscle pain and put some on after removing my KT tape and washing with soap and water, and I had a big chemical reaction between the two.

Personally, I wouldn't be putting myself out to have a relationship with somebody who pays no interest in me. Equally, I wouldn't expect my husband to have a close relationship with somebody who pays no interest and constantly argues with me. That's not fair. At the moment there are no consequences to her actions   you wouldn't put up with it with a child so she doesn't get a free pass.

Villain proudly tables Jd9h for the suicide bluff. I replay the hand in my head and realize that Villain has literally zero value combos that can jam river. Even if he had flushes in his range, he would only call river, and pretty much the only hands that can rejam river is FHs that he almost never has given my blockers and his turn check. So I realize that IF I WOULD HAVE TAKEN 15 SECONDS TO FUCKING THINK after getting jammed on I could have called and won the biggest pot of my life.

The reasoning is pretty simple   if you have 2 or more "allied" players at a poker table you have a huge advantage. As Jez points out, there no good way to combat this well. There are several poker related cryptos in development though; so if that something you interested in you can give them a try.
I was lucky enough to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium when they had a baby great white in their big tank. They had it there for a while (198 days, according to a Google search, which is about six and a half months) and got it to eat the food they gave it. It hung out nicely enough with the other critters but then had to be released when it attacked two other sharks it shared a tank with. The tank they kept it in is monstrous (one million gallons) and is home to tons of animals that all live together. If the great white had the place to itself it probably would have fared better, but that hundreds of critters that would need to be re homed, plus who knows if the GWS would have been happier for longer, or if she would have become just as depressed or aggressive, or what else could have happened.

Your response to her abuse in no way diminishes the fact that her behaviour qualifies as abuse to many or most here. 
Explaining success (or failure) is easy in hindsight, but a good theory can make a prediction. If strategic intelligence can truly bring a competitive advantage, its precursors should be measurable, and its bearers should be identifiable long before they succeed. But companies and firms are complex, luck plays a role, and neatly delineating causes and effects is impossible. So, to measure strategic intelligence and assess its contribution to performance, we replaced the complexity of real world markets with the clinical precision of behavioral experiments. To control for advantage from monopoly or unique resources, we created markets that excluded both. Instead, we designed markets where assets are identical, all information is public, and everyone can enter or exit and has equal access to resources.

Poker and gambling in general is a past time that most of us indulge in. Unfortunately gambling can transform us from being an occasional gambler into a gambling addict who may eventually even gamble his life away.. 
Marvel's biggest problem with Captain Marvel, however, is addressing The Superman Issue. If the question is how to make an all powerful hero interesting, it isn't answered in Captain Marvel. It's not an overriding dilemma here because the movie is in part about her discovering her capabilities and there's a momentary thrill to be had when they finally blossom. Going forward, however, it will create a problem when she's required to work with others. (It also opens of a Pandora's Box of plot holes for those who choose to look back at the entire MCU canon through the lens of this new character's existence.)

It's usually taken for granted that the cost of appealing is but a fraction of trial costs, since the expensive presentation of evidence is over and done with appeals are mostly just writing. An appeal is like a lottery ticket with much better than usual odds of winning. Experienced legal commentators, in this paper and elsewhere, have given plaintiffs a good chance of winning on appeal, some noting a number of probable errors in the trial record.

Three years ago, right before the credit meltdown began, some investment bankers from Wachovia called me to discuss whether or not they should invest in cosmetic surgery and non surgical products (things like Botox and breast implants). I told them I knew nothing about investment (although I do know quite a bit about cosmetic surgery since I finishing up a book on it), BUT since the entire industry was financed on credit (at very high interest rates) and that the people getting it could not really afford it (85% was financed on credit AND mostly by people who earned less than 59K a year), that the industry could not sustain itself, that a credit collapse was inevitable, that I personally would not invest in anything in the US given that most consumption was based on credit and credit has its limits..
