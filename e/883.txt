Many years ago when I was in South Korea, having English written on clothing was a big status symbol. It was also incredibly popular to have matching outfits for couples (think him and her outfits.) Walking around Seoul I can tell you the amount of profanity I seen written on clothing in English. One couple who had matching shirts on I saw had every racist and homophobic epithet you can think of scrawled all over their shirts. (N word, F Word, slang for asians, etc.   it was bad.)

They pay a lot of attention at these transactions of affection. Speaking of kittens and weakness, girls will outright challenge your manhood and say it offputing and not masculine if a guy loves his cat. This is how defective they are and obssessed by weakness.

I think the "I fine" thing can be used in a passive aggressive manner, but if it used to temporarily avoid conflict (which is later approached directly), I wouldn call that passive aggressive. A passive aggressive use would be one where you say "I fine" where the intent (and body language) is that the other person should infer what wrong, with no intention of directly approaching the issue.

That arrangement benefited Epstein in a number of ways. Unlike other high profile sex crime cases, federal prosecutors agreed to keep his sentencing quiet, thereby limiting media coverage. His underage victims   identified in FBI documents   weren't told about the plea deal so they weren't in court, where they could voice their objections and possibly sway the judge to give Epstein a harsher sentence or reject the agreement altogether.

Would Mr Putin then accept that Syria is no longer in a legal position to make any demands at all in return for putting those weapons out of its own reach? Somehow I doubt it. But there was a more insidious charge contained in Mr Putin sermon on respect for the law as laid down by the UN Security Council (which is to say by him, since he has a controlling veto). It was the taunt that world increasingly see[s] America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force And he went on, must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilised diplomatic and political settlement.

The Mantis Opera   Four Movements. Super obscure, but I absolutely love this project. Equal parts experimental, accessible, and catchy.

The system is broken, and many if not most cops agree and simply want to do the right thing.

Hey guys, so it been a few months that I been here now, and I trying more than ever to get into as much poker discussion as possible (which is a new aspect of my game) and I loving it. However, today I going to try my hand at piecing together something for /r/poker to really help our losing, breakeven, new uNL players. I am fully aware this has been done once before (especially since I will be quoting a lot of his content to really make this a jam packed guide) but it has now been 5 years since writeup on 2p2. What I would like to accomplish with this, is touch on many of the things he did, and add many more, to really aid our new players and players having trouble beating the micros. As mentioned, I will even use some of the content wrote, highlighted in bold to give credit for his writing, although I hear he quit playing so he probably wouldn care regardless. Hopefully that way it easier to combine all of the information rather than me trying to re write some of his concepts and call them my own, which isn necessary. I will also add some links during specific topics to videos I believe these players will find extremely useful. But without further ado, let get into how you can start becoming a winning player and climb through those micros! This will probably be long. veryyyyy long.

We gone several times during the soft opening in early December. The food is great, the staff are friendly, the space is open and clean. The only gripe we have is that over several visits we never saw an improvement in speed of service. I totally understand opening kinks, but one expects them to be worked out over the course of a month. Each time we there (with one exception when we were the only customers) the service is very slow with long spells of empty beer glasses. Also, three weeks in, they were still passing around a single piece of paper with the beer list or letting you read their list written on the back of their order pads. I kept hearing the reason was that their printer was broken. Seems like a quick trip to FedEx Office, Staples or UPS Store to make some copies would have been an easy and quick fix.

There was some concern last night about what all the redactions and the trade off with Kilimnik would amount to since they were brought up, at least, in this case. I wondering, if those were part of a separate ongoing investigation, hence the redactions up to and remaining through his sentencing, is it possible that a different investigation, one that implicates Trump and family, Stone and whoever else would be involved in the crux of this Russia investigation   which the SCO stated to the court per those redactions that "This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating.", is Paul Manafort able to be charged still with a whole new set of criminal charges apart from the personal bank fraud, failure to file and lying charges?

The passivity goes back to Sam Adams. The encampments got much worse after he protected the Occupy protests. I not disagreeing with that movement concern about the 1%, just observing that allowing long term camping in downtown parks under the guise of protest amplified the ongoing public camping problem. An unpopular observation, perhaps, but it was an obvious turning point. Would Adams have protected a long term occupation by social conservative groups? An anti gay rights encampment, for example, that claimed a free speech basis for living and pooping in public parks? Methinks not. Worst mayor ever.

There better, there worse. I live by myself in a spacious and well furnished two bedroom apartment in a modern downtown area.

I honestly wouldn have been surprised if she was 18, so imagine my surprise when she told me she was 28! I looked her up later on the Dream Heaven website and that lists her as 23, but she must be telling the truth because a woman wouldn lie about being older! Anyway, I give her a more generous score for 28 because she looked and felt so much younger. 
That implies BGS had one project in full production as of last March, and it uses the old animation system. So, it was either Fallout 76 near the end of development, or Starfield still uses the old animations, which would not be good news. If we assume the former, then Starfield moved from pre production (already active development, but not what the majority of the studio works on) to full production only in Q2 2018.

Basically, that area is designed for co op. Back when the areas first came out with the vanilla game as DLC, if you didn own the DLC you could set down your summon sign at those stone statues in the front of the area and players who did own the DLC could summon you. Basically, the point was to advertise to the non owning folks "look how cool this DLC is! You should buy it, too!" And the areas were designed to be brutally hard specifically through enemy spam and ganks in order to encourage co op play so that the people who did own the DLC would summon all the folks who didn can see the comparison to the rest of the game: most of the time, if you get "ganked" by more than two enemies at once, even in Scholar, it because you done something wrong you rushed forward when you should have hung back and pulled enemies, or something similar. That is, getting ganked is a sign you made a tactical error. But in the Iron Passage, the Cave of the Dead, the Frigid Outskirts, and the Memory of the Old Iron King, they deliberately throw many hazards at you at once in order to as close as necessary require co op play.)

Stay with your poker and build your bank roll by playing quality cards. Be patient and don try to force play. When you get a high quality hand you must push it. When you have a really good hand and the pot odds are to your advantage don overplay it and eliminate everyone too early. Many amateur players poker tournament strategies include playing very reduce early in a tournament, so rather than following them, make use of it to against them. Instead of trying to steal the pots, call raises, and re raise more often. Hopefully they will exit early and allow you to make your stack quietly. Later your opponents will tighten up their play and then you should adjust again and do the opposite.

In Q2, the total Construction Pipeline declined modestly to 3,325 projects/ 392,184 rooms, with projects down 2% and rooms 1% quarter over quarter. At 553 projects/67,641 rooms, Under Construction totals are at cyclical lows. Projects Scheduled to Start Construction in the Next 12 Months have fallen at a similar pace to 1,281 projects/134,437 rooms, while projects in Early Planning (EP) have actually increased a bit. Many EP projects have been affected by the continued uncertainty over obtaining financing.

LE expects total Construction Pipeline counts to continue to fall before leveling some time in 2011.
