I keep seeing people say this and it not true. They aren opposites at all. Exploitation in this context requires a baseline equilibrium in order to make sense from a theory perspective. GTO is the baseline. using tips and tricks that work well because your opponents are very bad) then that totally reasonable. But the concept of discussing GTO vs exploitative play doesn even make sense from a theoretical standpoint. You can be a winning player without understanding GTO but 0 of the best players in the world are doing that because it would be totally insane.

In the end, I think NANO has a pretty good tech with countless problems. So if its tech is gonna be the winner, some competent team will just improve NANO protocol and release a new coin with a proper issuance schedule that people can accept. There is zero privacy, zero forward secrecy or plausible deniability. Since the protocol is immensely limited, there can be any solution to those problems. Coloring coins are possible, hence no fungibility. There is no chance NANO is gonna be adopted as trading mean, with those problems in mind. I can go on forever. not contributing to the real discussion. Most of the legit criticism is downvoted. The community of NANO becoming a cult. You are harming yourself with taking this path.

The cannon exists. It moves the same as a rook but captures by jumping over a piece (the setup, can be friendly or enemy) and taking the first piece on the path between the cannon and the setup. They incredibly powerful and have a lot of different setups. Right at the start you can kill the enemy horse with your cannon, but this is a terrible move since the cannon more valuable early on (more pieces to setup with), and the horse is right next to the rook, which essentially gives your opponent a free setup for their rook.

Second, there a pretty good chance you won do all that great in law school. That doesn mean you not smart, but when it comes to law school being smart doesn have much to do with it. Law school is a grind, and those that grind the hardest reap the rewards. You might be thinking "i really looking for my "thing" in life, and I totally ready to grind for it" Sorry, but you not, not like this. Think about the worst people you know, those uninteresting types that don care about anything aside from their job, those types that treat everyone around them like shit because they too focused on themselves, the worst possible personalities you come across thus far. those people are in law school. And they don give a shit about anything else in life at all, so they going to work A LOT harder than you.

I mean I agree things are definitely heightened/exaggerated but I always saw it as being staged as a tragic melodrama, as many Darren Aronofsky movies are (the first sounds of the film are a symphony warming up, as if you were in a theater about to watch some operatic performance). The theme of the film is not "drugs are bad" but how addiction and the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream can get tangled and lead to one's self destruction, in this case it's characters using drugs to obtain that goal. So objectively yes, drugs like opiates and uppers can be very bad for you, people have gotten infections from using dirty needles, whored themselves out to maintain an expensive drug habit, get jailed for holding drugs, and have died/been irreparably damaged from legal drugs. I never got the sense that the movie was saying "try drugs once and you'll die" but saw it more as using all the tools of the medium of film to depict a tragedy of people who have good intentions but continue down a path that will inevitably lead to their own annihilation (a common theme of Aronofsky's movies).

Lunge: From a standing position, with your feet together and toes pointing forward, "lunge" forward with your right foot. Keep your knees bent and your chest up as you lunge. Be sure your right heel strikes the floor before the rest of the foot.

Repeat 11 more times; then lunge 12 times with the left foot. To increase the intensity of this stretch, do lunges onto a step or small platform.

I see the logic in the argument. Though one could argue that due to a stagnation of wages, minimum wage has failed to rise with inflation and has actually dropped. All these min wage raises did was bring people up to inflation.

The worst thing about Keepass was the file wouldn necessarily get saved back to Dropbox properly, so we end up spawning copies of it and have to import them back into the original occasionally.

A constant reminder that the answer of "what did I fight for?" Exists more in theoretical pockets of what we want us to be, as opposed to a strong fabric of what we are.

Performance pressures of physical exhaustion was induced via an exercise protocol consisting of intervals of maximal exertion undertaken on a watt bike.Results: At a group level, under physical pressure elite athletes were faster to respond to control trials on the Stroop Task and to simple probabilistic choices on the CGT. Physical pressure was also found to increase risk taking for decisions where probability outcomes were explicit (on the CGT), but did not affect risk taking when probability outcomes were unknown (on the BART). There were no significant correlations in the degree to which individuals' responses changed under pressure across the three tasks, suggesting that elite athletes did not show consistent responses to physical pressure across measures of decision making.

People tend to think of Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet as this classic love story, but they usually don get the fact that Juliet is specifically said to be 13 years old: "she hath not seen the change of 14 years." Romeo age is never mentioned, but 16 17 is a reasonable guess (any older, and he surely would be married). Shakespeare audiences would have recognized the absurdity of two children of wealthy families getting married by their own decision for love.

At some point, Smith's trainer Joe Gallagher should have read him the riot act and told him to stay off the ropes, because that's where Smith was giving up the rounds.

It's the way light reflects off the skin. In film they have to blast extra light on to darker skin tones to make them not look like they are in a shadow. When cameras were first invented it was hard to capture black people properly because the cameras were designed to capture light skin, because they never bothered to try it on black people when they were being built. An example of this is season one of the office does a horrible job at lighting kelly and Stanley and it drives me nuts. Also that's why automatic soap/water/paper towel dispensers don't work well at detecting darker skin. There's a few videos on YouTube of this but I can't find the specific one I'm thinking of now, where it's a white and black guy and it only works for the black guy and it's really funny.

Come from the realm of Harry Potter, where you no doubt have Heard that Dumbledore is Gay, and it causes much distress to both Queer and Straights alike. One of the things I hear about the most is how people feel this is just to entice Queer folk to read Harry Potter, or in some manner support it, but since Dumbledore doesn take any action that supposedly makes him then it just baits people into it without delivering on some perceived promise. Their stance is that in order to represent gays you have to Gay (whatever that means?!). Being gay isn't a physical attribute and a lot of times it's displayed as such in popular media. In reality it can be a lot more difficult to discern someone's sexuality and if it doesn't explicitly come up you might never know. Being a gay man, I haven't been bothered by Soldier's sexuality reveal. In fact, it makes me happy to see inclusivity that doesn't cater to tropes.

Eh, as far as I know, no admin came in and fixed things. I did add on an admin to the mod team but that was more coincidental timing than anything   we lost a couple mods and needed some new ones. I had talked to the admin over the summer at a reddit meet up and figured he be perfect for the spot since he a huge browns fan and from the area. I didn add him on solely because he is an admin, though it did help make it look like we were doing something to address the issue so I kept my mouth shut. :)

But the point I making is firstly that if male characters aren designed with being attractive as the first priority then female characters shouldn be, and secondly that a lot of female sexualization is uncomfortable and denigrating to women while a lot of male sexualization is generally respectful to men.

There is a very long standing, deeply connected, and barely secret community around the participation in and facilitation of child abuse in the industry, and it extends publicly to the protection of the jobs and images of the abusers.

Hi. I am a native English speaker living in a non native English speaking country. I have many friends and students from many countries and their is kind of an unspoken etiquette about this. Generally you speak in your conversation in the language that you think the most people will understand. If you have trouble, you switch for a phrase and then try to explain it or ask for help explaining it. Sometimes big groups fracture, and in that instance it ok to speak in the most common language there, but if someone joins, you may want to switch back when you would normally say "we were just talking about X." What you should not do under any circumstance is proceed to speak in a language that someone does not understand (unless you share no languages) because that is just telling them that they are not welcome in the conversation. I suggest the next time she does this right in front of you, you just ask your boyfriend what she said (don be embarrassed to not know a language, it like being embarrassed you can suddenly pick up a guitar and play free bird) and then respond to it like she was talking to you too. If she continues, tell her that you feel left out (dint be embarrassed to have emotions that are appropriate in the situation) and you would like to be in the conversation too.

Then I hear some shrieking coming from the bathroom. as it turned out, the enema was enormously successful, this petite 12 yr old girl had produced a shit as big as my arm, and the mom freaked out, fished the monster turd out of the toilet chased the doctor through the department insisting the doctor look at the size of it and screaming that this anaconda like shit must have caused internal damage or something.

Teostra, Kushala Daora, Lunastra and Vaal Hazak could maybe have a second phase, but if they do I certainly haven noticed any difference (even Nergigante second phase is faily hard to notice in the first place, unless you know what the roar looks like when he enters it). All of those monsters have in common that they can be captured BTW.

Most card rooms. give every player at the table the right to see all cards that called to a showdown, even if they are mucked as losers. (This helps prevent cheating by team play.) If you are extremely curious about a certain hand, ask the dealer to show it to you. It is considered impolite to constantly ask to see losing cards. It is even more impolite if you hold the winning cards, and in most card rooms. you will forfeit the pot if the "losing" cards turn out to be better than yours.

Because the way players play is important, it is helpful to place them into categories. Some players find that by attaching names with categories it helps them recall how each opponent plays. Here is a list of different playing styles followed by suggested names for each type of player. It is important to remember that any player may change from one playing session to the next and that some players can even change within a playing session. A poor player may improve over time, and a good player may be having a bad day. Therefore, it is a good idea to use the beginning of each session to re evaluate any familiar opponents while you evaluate new ones.

As business investment grew, so did the job market and the number of Americans paying taxes, confirming what President Kennedy said a paradoxical truth that the soundest way to raise (tax) revenues in the long run is to cut (tax) rates now. GDP would be $1.2 trillion larger, and 7.9 million more Americans would have jobs. Americans have been denied this prosperity because of unprecedented levels of government spending, job killing regulation and crony capitalism partisan policies that large majorities of business leaders in two recent surveys (Business Roundtable and National Federation of Independent Business) say hurt them. economy. When interest rates increase from historic lows, larger interest payments will necessitate draconian budget cuts and increased taxes. Absent rapid GDP growth to bring debt to GDP levels down to manageable norms, Americans can be confident in a future that holds only two unacceptable alternatives substantial tax increases or sustained inflation.

Nine or ten players is customary in Omaha high low split, which has a rotating blind system (meaning for every hand, a certain player must contribute a set amount of money to start the betting). Usually a score of eight or better is placed on the low hand, and the best high hand will split the pot with the best low hand. This means for a hand to qualify as a low, it must have five cards not paired that are ranked eight or lower. Then three community cards are dealt face up in the center of the table. These cards are called the "flop." Another card is dealt face up, which is called the "turn," followed by the last card being dealt face up, called the "river." Rounds of betting are before the flop, after the flop, after the turn, and after the river.

So they probably assumed it was standard and begrudgingly rolled with it..

I found it really not as good as Champion in a number of situations. Often, good engines will require playing a lot of terminal actions per turn, where Academy will fall flat relative to Champion. It good for games where you only need a few terminal actions to be played each turn, along with some way of gaining actions. But yeah, it helpful to have for sure, just not nearly as good. It takes a while to get a Champion though, so for the investment, probably worth it.

Consider, it is better to push all in by betting than by calling, since you want to look strong to have more impact. The best feeling in poker is deciding someone is bluffing and taking down a large pot with a bluff of your own, causing the first bluffer to fold, and no one ever knows whether either or both of you were bluffing..

Hand 1: Against this player type we way ahead of his range and should 4b. Sizing should be large to reduce your positional disadvantage, and because we really shouldn mind a fold, whatever hand he has likely had a decent amount of equity against us. Bigger 4b also makes for a more natural sizing for flop shoves. I 4b to 400. Snap calling 5 bet. If called, shoving most flops to deny his equity/get a bad call from AJ/AQ. If we flop an A or K, checking to induce. Even if he calls our shove and has a pair we usually have 25% equity which is not terrible. But expecting to be ahead sometimes. As played, bet calling around 1/2 pot.
