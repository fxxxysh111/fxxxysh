Surprised because I was able to read it (believe me, my French is horrible)  but shocked really that the very same Minister of French Culture who has so vehemently defended Roman Polanski and insisted that Polanski rape of a 14 year old girl was "ancient history," and so beautifully illustrated that the French really do see sex differently than Americans  was now facing political scandal himself..

Das Kapitel ber den loose aggressiven Style ist sicherlich das Highlight des Buches. Beschrieben wird wie man mit diesem eigentlich geldverschwenderischen Stil richtig Geld verdienen kann. Zwar bilden sich viele ein loose aggressiver Winning Player zu sein, aber es steckt viel mehr dahinter als raisen, raisen und reraisen. Das Kapitel zeigt wie man diesen Stil wirklich richtig anwendet. Zwar muss ich noch das ein oder andere mal drber lesen, aber ich bin mir sicher das richtige Werkzeug in die Hand bekommen zu haben.
Also, tournaments are such high variance that it can be a bad thing to take the cash. Practically speaking, however, a lot of players are accustom to splitting the remaining prize pool equally among the remaining players regardless of stack size, and are hostile toward deviations from that unless there are (and sometimes despite) big deltas between stacks..

A couple look decent, the animals seem cared for decently, but most of them (and the ones with the most animals to be sure) have them crammed into tightly packed enclosures, many of which have zero access to go outside.

The viewer sees a wider tragedy unfolding, in hindsight, from the safety of a desk; the soldiers are reacting in real time, on high alert, exposed. recent studies, researchers have shown that such distance tempts people to script how they would act in the same place, and overestimate the force of their own professed moral principles.

She says she lives with constant pain, because her left hand moves all the time.

But it sounds like you are asking about whether it okay to share a news article (for example) that uses Facebook or Disqus to run their comments section? Our rule against linking to social media is to protect users anonymity, and the things we remove under this rule include people sharing unedited screenshots of their family Facebook conversations or blogs that have a bunch of identifying information. Honestly, I can think of a time when we removed a news article just because it had a comments section (except in this case of an article bringing out the estranged parents in the comments, which happens every so often). I happy to check with the other mods in case they have a different opinion, but your example feels like an edge case that we wouldn remove unless there was something else obviously problematic [EDIT: for example, if it broke our drive by diagnosis rule].

A friend of mine stopped cosplaying with his boyfriend a lot because it was a mixture of fetishization and transphobia. I actually know more than just this couple who stopped doing this (joys of being a trans weeb I guess, we congregate), but this particular one said that he wasn sure if the transphobia or a fetishism was worse. One particular instance, they were doing some of the typical "plz kiss/eyefuck/simulate sex" requests (they did the more tame ones and shot down the more overly sexual ones) most BL/slash couple cosplayers got but once a girl in the crowd realized he was trans (his cosplay involved an open shirt and he thinks she must have noticed his top surgery scars) the questions and "requests" got a LOT more invasive and gross. It sounds like it was a case of a couple weeb BL fangirls who had literally no sense of not acting inappropriate in public and they didn actually mean any harm but the overt sexual fetishization of him being trans started like a microsecond after she had her lightbulb "oh you trans" moment and decided that it turned her on that he was trans and his boyfriend was cis (well she assumed anyway and was right in that case but it not like he couldn have been trans as well lol), and her friends to some extent got in on the inappropriate questioning and requests too.
As I said on another posting of the same story, all of Ottawa snow (or the vast, vast, vast majority) fell from mid January to mid February. We got 97 cm in January (again, the vast majority in the second half), and then had another 30+ cm storm in mid February. That a fairly small window for getting snowed in, and if it was after the February storm (which we have no idea when the snowblower broke), then staying the course spring isn insane if you have reasonable preparations in place.

Let me just say one more thing about the director. There have been a lot of conversations about women, and we see that this year there are no women directors nominated. We have an ongoing research agenda dealing with this issue, trying to see if there is any discrimination in Hollywood. What was interesting so far we haven done all the data analysis is that the number of women who enter the profession is very low. That really a big, big problem that we see in that sense.

The Centre Party of Juri Ratas, the prime minister, gets most of the Russian vote. It is used to EKRE exploiting ethnic tension. But the fearmongering has less traction in this election, thinks Raimond Kaljulaid, a Centre Party MP.

After a huge decline from 1991 to 2014, the population has risen for the past three years. Last year more Estonian citizens returned to the country than left.
While playing baccarat at the Borgata in 2012, Ivey and Cheng Yin Sun identified inconsistencies on the back of the cards that helped them determine their value.While it had already been determined that Ivey and his colleague did not mark the cards and did not commit fraud, the court ruled that they failed to abide by the Casino Controls Act because they asked various dealers to arrange the cards so Sun could get a better look at them, thereby creating an advantage.Ivey, 39, had argued in a court filing that he never touched the cards. He called his attempt to gain an advantage akin to the house trying to distract him with "free alcohol served by only the most curvaceous and voluptuous females in the industry," The Record reported.Ivey's attorney, Louis Barbone, said Monday that he would "look forward to our absolute right of appeal," according to The Record.In a similar case in London, a British court ordered Ivey to repay Crockfords Club casino millions that he had won while edge sorting. He lost an appeal last month.
While some comments seem to be referring to "most," some sure seem to have bitterness aimed at women in general. If I shaped my opinion of all men based on the awful behaviors I experienced from many, not only would I lose my faith in men but I would have treated some really wonderful people poorly based on a generalization.

A game of video poker begins when a player inserts money or ticket into a video poker machine as a bet of one or more credits. After this, a "deal" button found in the machine should be pressed. This action draws the cards in the video poker machine. At this point, the player has an option to keep or exchange one or more cards for a new one from the deck of cards. After this, the video poker machine evaluates the hand. A pay schedule of winning hands is usually posted. If the hand matches one of those, then the video poker will offer a payout.

We stonden pas om 8u op, en het was dan ook al na 10u toen we het Rode Plein opwandelden. Op het programma stond het Lenin Mausoleum: het hoekige rode gebouwtje op het Rode Plein waar de voormalige Sovjet leider al sinds 1924 gebalsemd ligt. Het is niet zo heel veel open, vandaar dat het nu op het programma stond. Verdacht dat er bijna geen rij stond, maar toen we niet door mochten van de politie viel roebel dat we vanaf het Man plein moesten aanschuiven.

This stands for "Radio Frequency Identification". There are machines that can place a tag that is common to this technology onto poker chips for the sake of securing and ensuring that they are authentic.

So, what makes gambling on the internet so attractive? Yes, you'll be able to play any game of your selection without having having to leave your favourite chair. Still, you can not be served free drinks; you will not be able to watch the game you have got wagered on from huge Tv screens; you could neither see the facial expressions of the poker opponents nor to hear the sounds on the coins fall from the slot machine once you hit the major jackpot..

I knew I had another job lined up that starts next week and that I was taking a huge financial hit, but i had enough of old people yelling at me.

This was at a time when retail prices were officially unchanged, leading to huge increases in consumption.Compounded onto this was the large scale extensive growth in the land scheme, where huge amounts of soviet investment were put into fertilizing and preparing the Kazakhstan region for cultivation. These types of projects were common throughout the soviet era, as for planned economies an extensive growth in the inputs of production is much easier to accomplish then the intensive growth with existing inputs as we see in modern economies.The early surge in farm production encouraged him to talk in 1957 of overtaking American per capita meat production by 1975, something to which the Soviet Union never came close. Reliance on the unstable grain harvest from the Virgin Lands produced acute difficulties when the harvest failed both there and in traditional grain growing regions in 1963.Talk of overtaking the US both in terms of meat production and in terms of the general economy now looks silly.

Another factor to consider is something called "implied odds." Implied odds take into account not only the money in the pot and the amount of the bet but also the possibility of collecting extra bets when you hit your hand. For instance, in the previous example, if all four players act before you call on the turn, more than likely one or more of them will call a bet or raise by you on the river if you hit your hand..

Well, there two factors at play. Your internet connection is fast, period. But slowness can be caused by a slow connection or a distant server. As a visitor, you likely accessing services that are hosted on foreign servers. In that case, the limiting factor is not your connection speed, but rather the time and other losses that are involved in communicating halfway around the globe. You see the reverse effect if you go home and try to open up some Korean hosted site like Kakao Map.

If you want to learn to program, IMO Python is a better starting point, you are just less likely to burn out and you can make real tangible things much more quickly. Python isn super useful for making games, but it will probably make it a lot easier for you to pick up and use C or C++. I try to approach things in terms of what will be more fun, not what is more marketable. I have tried learning programming four or five times over the years and got bored before making anything I could use, then I tried Python and it was actually fun to learn. YMMV.

My current full time job is at a Japanese market as a cashier and, honestly, though i love to meet with people, i don really want to keep cashiering for even another year. While it daunting to think about, I turned 24 this last December and I feel i called to do greater things with my life, both internally (relating to ethics and meditation) and in the world as not just a job but as a service. I want to go to massage therapy school, get my license, and further develop my skills in Tui Na, Shiatsu, and other "Eastern" modalities of body work. My teacher would sometimes mention to me that, in acupuncture school (i think in Taiwan) she learned more about just that: acupuncture, acupressure, and probably Chinese herbs as well.

It inspiring to me to learn that i could do this as well someday, and really develop a skill. I can see myself learning from, perhaps, a Shaitsu or Anma master in Japan or perhaps a Tui Na master in Taiwan to really hone my skills and that particular field and, therefore, be able to skillfully offer that service to others.

Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently.

That is exactly what 64 year old grandfather John Hesp managed to do last July in the World Series of Poker main event in Las Vegas.

Plant based diets might be a healthy option for stool bulk and intestinal health, but again the problem with cancer is that you have cells growing uncontrollably that your body is no longer killing. The disease isn't so much a disease in the typical sense, rather it's your body doing what it's not supposed to  parts growing way too quickly without stopping like it's normally supposed to. Even if you were to follow a plant based diet or every possible best practice, you'll always have exposure to outside sources of damage that can cause cells to grow out of control. Whether that is UV light, exposure to carcinogens, smoking, or even being born with cancer prone genetics (Eg hereditary risks like breast cancer is a good example), there will always be a risk. There is a bit of a luck component as much as there is a lifestyle component.

Barton's bill would open up that market by establishing a regulatory framework and consumer protections. Each state could decide whether to let its residents play online. He's hoping the effort gains more traction this year, now that online poker is under review by lawmakers in Pennsylvania, California, New York and other states.

That opened the door for states to decide whether to allow online poker, a move that has irked lawmakers in both parties ever since.

Play to your position, in a early position if you have a strong hand make sure you put a reasonable bet in, at the very least three times the big blind, enough to make people put down there terrible hands, otherwise they may continue to play and get to see the flop cheap. Never make it cheap for other players to hit. In a late position if the game has been called all the way round perhaps you will just call too and hope to get lucky, but the odd bet even with rubbish can narrow out you opponents and hopefully help you win that hand.

Honestly, something like this is so trivial that you really don't even need to let it become a "thing". Your kids watch what you deem appropriate for them while they're in your care.
