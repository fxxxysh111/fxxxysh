We were out with them until 5 in the morning and then we slept for a few hours and then left town   onto the next adventure!

That comes out to about 7 micrograms of mass lost. Since 0.1 lb is 45.4 grams, it means the air is too light by a factor of 15 million or so. If you remember earlier when I said you can fuck up your estimation a lot of times and still see if you're on the right track, that's what I mean. All of our numbers were wrong, but not a factor of 15 million wrong.

A good poker strategy also requires a player to vary his poker approach. This means that there should be times that you know how to tactically bluff a game. This, in turn, will make other players have a hard time reading your cards or predict your next moves.

What's not talked about in this thread is ride quality and investment encouragement. People prefer to ride the train or light rail over busses and would prefer to live near a train station over a bus stop. Trackless tram routes are much cheaper to provide than light rail routes but have nearly all of the benfits of a tram. (Cheaper to build compared to rail) Bus routes change, bus routes dont have fixed stops, buses are hard to read/work/laptop on, buses have accessibility issues. A tram does all of the above better and has far more scalability (volume of people moved) than any bus system/dedicated lane. It also encourages higher development density and higher quality of development. (Think about the types of developments near train stations compared to large bus stops).

That partly feeds into the "layered" thing. Bangkok isn a superficial city, but instead a city with hundreds of years of history and development, with much of it still there, layered on top of the previous, going back as far as the 18th century, if you look deep enough. But Bangkok is also layered at the street level, in that in one street you will see a big modern mall, but if you look closer and around you see a mixture of all sorts of other kinds of street life of all levels of society and history..

Keep on with the mental gymnastics, but heres a cold hard fact.
It would then move to the next player who would either "see" this amount (and thus add in her own fiver), "raise" it (which would be tossing in that $5 and another $5 for the raise), or "fold" (which is where you lay your cards down and look at everyone else expectantly because you're done for that round and you don't think you're going to win. Or you just think that $5 is a bit too much to risk, being a conservative high roller who's willing to give up the ante you put in the pot). You keep going around the table until everyone has a chance to see, raise or fold, and if there are raises then each person who wants to stay in must match the bets made..

Prepare your food. The day before you get your braces, indulge in things you'll have a difficult time eating when you get braces. This includes meat and things that can get caught in the wires of your braces. Stock your refrigerator and freezer with soft and easy to eat food so you can still eat after you get your braces. Ice cream and fruit shakes are soothing to eat if you recently got braces. It may be hard to chew immediately after, so have some soft food like bananas, mashed potato and pasta on hand.

Kudos to the Giants for making this move. Cutting Jose Castillo and sending John Bowker down to Fresno so he can figure out the strike zone was long overdue.

Si j'prouvais un tel choc, c'est que la lecture de "Par del bien et mal",  laquelle succda "La Gnalogie de la morale", me dlivrait d'un fardeau pnible ; non pas celui du christianisme, comme on pourrait s'y attendre   je faisais plus ou moins profession d'athisme   mais celui du communisme. Car  l'poque je me croyais encore communiste. J'avais adhr au Mouvement des Jeunesses Communistes  quinze ans et je croyais au sens de l'histoire. Or la lecture de Nietzsche pulvrisait ces certitudes. Nietzsche dsacralise compltement l'histoire, notamment celle de la Rvolution franaise. Pour lui, un des principaux moteurs de la Rvolution franaise ne fut pas le dsir de justice mais le ressentiment qui habitera son credo galitaire. J'tais boulevers par ce que je lisais  ce sujet car j'avais prouv cette puissance de ressentiment chez les jeunes communistes que j'avais ctoy  Aix en Provence. Je n'avais pas connu, parmi eux, le sentiment de partage et de fraternit que j'avais ressenti, par moment, avec les catholiques que je frquentais depuis mon enfance. Un jour, un responsable communiste venu  ma rencontre aprs avoir lu une lettre que j'avais envoye  la direction du PCF concernant sa stratgie   j'tais trs prtentieux, comme on l'est souvent  cet ge   m'avait dit avec un srieux que je juge aujourd'hui comique, en regardant la rsidence bourgeoise o j'habitais : "Profites en bien parce que cela ne durera pas longtemps", comme si la rvolution tait imminente et que la maison o nous vivions allait nous tre confisque.

Also it seems you lack some of the basic economic logic and common sense.

Just 40 years ago cultural revolution basically declassed the general population and everyone was equally poor.

Everything you post is spot on! We love our drive home and are glad to share our road with bikers and others but the groups, as of recent, are too much. It has been discussed in our household, and agreed, that we will not pass riders unless safe, and we will not go into the oncoming lane unless clear. It is a good and safe practice. However with the large numbers in a group riding several riders across the lane, then moving into two columns when the riders think it is safe for a car to pass, it is still dangerous and I will not put myself or my car in danger. I am one of the drivers that will get tailed and honked at because I will not pass the bikers if not clearly safe. Other drivers do as well. I completely agree that someone will get hurt. So, whether you are biker or driver, please please use our drive, HRD, safely but with consideration of others. And don be an ass about it. It is the right thing to do.

The basic formula for the player's expected loss combines the amount of time played, the number of hands per hour, the average bet, and the house percentage. So if a blackjack player bets $5 a hand for an hour at a busy table speed of 60 hands per hour, and the house figures it has a 2 percent edge, then the player is betting $300 per hour, and the house, on the average expects to win $6, or 2 percent of $300. 
The first job I ever had was working as a delivery driver for Mr. M's, the shadiest sandwich shop in the history of creation. "Mr. M's sure is a strange name for a sandwich shop!" you might be saying to yourself, and I couldn't agree more. The only reason the place was named Mr. M's is because the business that was there before us was a sub shop called Mr. Jim's, and my manager cunningly realized that it is far cheaper to simply remove two letters from the sign than buy a whole new one. The front of the building literally read "Mr. __m's", with the eerily naked spacing of those two missing letters staring out at you like a photo in a child's obituary, demanding to know how the world could've allowed this to happen. That sentence also describes what it was like to work there for a summer.
SnK is pretty clearly a story about nationalism, and by extension fascism, and he obviously using the ww2 parallels to emphasize this.

When McManus writes about the social dynamics of teenage boys he is hilarious and dazzling. This poignancy continues throughout the book's second half as Vince becomes more emotionally complex.

Their racing days are over by age 4. It's what happens then that has created a widespread backlash against greyhound racing: Up until the late 1980s, the dogs were routinely euthanized once they were no longer useful. There are horror stories of dogs being left behind by their owners at Florida track kennels to sicken or starve to death. (In 2003, the Paragould Animal Welfare Society in Greene County found six starving greyhounds, one of them pregnant, a dead greyhound in a racing cage, two dead greyhounds in a shed and 15 greyhound bodies in a non working freezer at an abandoned breeding farm.) Though the Greyhound Racing Association frowns on it, some farms train puppies on live lures, like rabbits, guinea pigs or chickens. Arkansas laws on greyhound farms do not prohibit live lures, though the state's animal cruelty laws should.

I explicitly said I wanted to be at my parent house by 6pm (hour drive) for thanksgiving cause that is when my brother would be arriving and I was really looking forward to seeing him, and he fucked it up. An hour before we had to leave I was packed and ready, and he was still doing nothing. When it was actually time to leave, I was standing at the door with bags in hand and the big manchild said out loud that he needed some milk and cookies. He completely ignoring me saying we needed to go now cause this was important to me. As he sat down with his milk and fucking cookies, I told him I had it and was driving myself there and he could follow. When ex did arrive, he was grumpy because he had to drive and he hates driving and was basically an asshole the rest of the night. Instead of spending the rare time with my whole fam, I spent nearly an hour trying to soothe/get him set up in the den with tv so he wouldn be such a cunt to be around.

Assume responsibility for your employees' mistakes. When one of your underlings makes a mistake, don't lord it over them; assume the mistake as your own, even if it isn't technically yours.

It is NOT a bone slipping back into place or any such nonsense.constant adjusting or stretching of the joint tissues leads to looser joints (duh) and increases the chance of these joints becoming lax or unstable. if due to injury of some kind the joint capsules, ligaments, muscles etc are excessively tight, well then some loosening and mobilizing can feel good, causing muscles to relax, and be a good thing.however most people suffer from weak core muscles and overly lax ligaments/joint capsules of the spine from slouching forward too much, say while using a computer or driving, and loosening or excessive mobility is the last thing people need.keep in mind that as people age they shed muscle if they are not regular exercisers, so the muscles that support those loose joints in your 30s are not there in your 40s.

Plastic Poker Chips have also been called the honest tokens and first came on the scene in the 1930s as an inexpensive alternative to the traditionally clay or clay composite chips that are found in professional casinos. The Depression gave rise to the need for an inexpensive chip that could be easily used throughout all the illegal speakeasies that dotted the landscape during Prohibition. It was simple to dispose of plastic chip sets to avoid detection and their loss so that no one suffered financially..

Looking back over my geological career, I realise how lucky I was to be a working scientist during the later part of the twentieth century when ideas on the nature of the Earth underwent a revolution. When I was a student in the early 1960s, the idea of continental drift was regarded by many people as laughable. Twenty years later the concept of plate tectonics was widely accepted, and it started to be appreciated that the older rocks in New Zealand were a fragment of the ancient Gondwana continent. This book is an excellent account of how New Zealand is part of the largely submerged continent of Zealandia, now the world's seventh continent, extending from New Caledonia in the north to Campbell Island in the south. Indeed, as both of them have played a leading role in developing ideas on the nature of continental New Zealand, it would be difficult to find a reviewer who did not know them, and many of the other scientists who feature in this volume.

Another variation is to have five suspects, and each has a progress bar that ends in either ruling out that suspect or discovering they're the one. Finishing any track ends in immediate success or incremental progress. So you can always get there but there's a fast track for the clever. This can be further complicated in various ways. Tracks could contain hints that this is or isn't the right one: players are almost at the end of track 1 where evidence so far rules out that suspect except for one anomaly: do they check on it (which might be hard or risky) or try another track? Or, maybe no single track proves that suspect is the one: two tracks end in end "probably guilty", but the final bit of proof is in one of three starred items on the other tracks.

I work for insurance companies, and generally, it is different. Most carriers adopt a scoring model from a third party in the insurance industry that generates a "credit based insurance score." My understanding is it is based on the information you'd see in a credit report, but weighted differently to more heavily reflect the indicators for risk when it comes to insurance. Generally, I'd say it can't hurt to reach out and try to run a new score; my previous company would apply the new one if it improved and keep the old one if it had gone down. You'll probably want to confirm how this would be handled with your company, and how often you can request a new score (generally once a year is what I've seen). I don't think all companies get updated reports at the same frequencies as your policies renew either; while new reports should theoretically most accurately reflect the current risk, these reports do cost $ for the companies so some may only do it every few renewals, or only at your request to try and save some $.

I spoke with our Housekeeping Manager and she believes you may have been the guest that she worked directly with on a few occasions. She stated that you refused service on your first day, and that she serviced your room personally on your second day and that she spoke to your husband about this herself. She said that we also changed your sheets out on the 3rd day of your stay, and that we did drop off some supplies at your door as part of our "do not disturb" housekeeping policy. 
The idea of urban bombing was still pretty new in 1927, as was the idea of attacking cities that weren necessarily military targets.

What amazing about these? What people mistake for "amazing" is that the demographics are homogenous and make them comfortable. The likelihood of some amazing teaching working there is only slightly higher than other places. It not as if they have some super magical screening process that makes it so they only hire geniuses.

Alas, this economy is notoriously uncompetitive because tax rates are too high, regulation is too heavy, and executives are too complacent. It thrives only in good times, as it lacks the mojo to push through heavy weather. President Donald Trump upended trade policy; and Canada heavily indebted households decided to finally retreat after years of unsustainable spending.

As someone who loves thin girls, I really chose well. I noticed immediately that she had long, slender legs and was already getting turned on. When she opened her blouse, she had a gorgeous, flat, taut belly and I just couldn wait to get to her! Perhaps inevitably, she had very small breasts, but for me at least breast size is not high on my list. When a woman is beautiful, has a flat belly, thin legs, a cute butt and a great pussy, then what if she has small breasts. Also, her skin was glossy and gorgeous to the touch. Her pussy hair was probably in its natural state but not too long, and was very snug inside.9/10

Learn how to space your back air and learn how to convert stray hits into combos/strings. Luigi has an extremely bad air speed and relies on his out of shield options and grab to get hits, so if you practice spacing your moves outside his range and how to mix up your shield pressure, Luigi will have an extremely hard time landing hit. Watch how the top Inkling players play neutral and start their combos and apply that to your own gameplay.

Among baseball's worst teams from their expansion season in 1962, the Mets lost more than 100 games in five of their first six seasons and had never won more than 73 games in their first seven years. With cherished Brooklyn Dodgers star Gil Hodges as their manager, a young corps of pitchers led by Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Gary Gentry and a still wild Nolan Ryan, and an offence that included Cleon Jones and Tommie Agee, the Mets overtook the Chicago Cubs to win the NL East with a 100 62 record.

I haven't really seen how the term is used to shut down discussions. Likewise, I don't see it as agenda driven. I see it used as a tool to discuss the remnants of a hopefully dying, misogynistic culture, that used to be very real at least when I was growing up. 
Star outfielder Gordon agrees to contract extension with Royals
Agree with the other poster. The most obvious thing to correct is maintaining tightness at the bottom. An easy way to practice maintaining tightness is to do some spoto press. It basically stopping the bar about 1 2" above the chest and pausing there so you can relax. Then when you do your competition bench, apply the same thing but with the bar stopping right on your chest.

State Amendment No. 33 allowing video gambling machines at racetracks and casinos: YES. I think that gambling should be legal everywhere.

3. Hands and Arms: As one astute police officer said   feet never killed anyone. The reference was to the fact that overwhelmingly, hands hovering around the waistband represent a threat. At any moment, the person could produce a weapon, and so it's important to watch the hands closely at all times. While things like balled fists are an obvious sign of aggression, keep in mind that many attacks come from the position of crossed arms, or hands in pockets.

While I am not 100% convinced I'd be happy to chime in. The fact that he stated that, "I was the last person to see Jody alive," When it was only a missing persons case seems a bit damning. I believe it was also reported that he had a romantic interest in her that was not reciprocated. I don't recall the timeline but I believe she was at his house until 10 or 11 PM the night prior which is odd for a work night after she had spent all day at a golf tournament. In short, I stand to reason that he made an advance on her that evening which she shut down which triggered deadly consequences the following morning.

If I see a function from (forall a. a  > a) in Haskell I can know in my bones it either throws an exception all the time or it passes the argument through unmolested.

7. Slow down your movements. A woman who moves slowly and decisively has become a rarity. We are so used to the Mary Tyler Moore, Calista Flockhart, and Jennifer Aniston behavior that we forget that deliberate, controlled behavior is admirable and desirable. Your walk should be solid and direct. Do not float or flick, but rather glide and press. There should be some weight to your walk. The heavier you appear in your movements, the more powerful you appear. If you like to be light on your feet, you will be treated like a "light weight."
