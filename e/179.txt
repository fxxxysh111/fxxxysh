I appreciate the optimism, which I believe is important, if not a guarded optimism. However I'm not sure I'd say the majority of fossil fuels are in the ground. And even still, we are not in a position to stop this train anytime soon, even with all the political will coming together all at once. Are we intending to unplug all the coal fire power plants by the end of the year and replace those with renewables? Do we all plan to scrap our cars for EVs? It will, at best, be a long process with many fits and starts along the way as we've seen, coupled with huge opposition by the majority of the population when it comes time to actually change our behavior.

You think I kidding? Barking up the wrong tree? The 90 million dogs we know about are increasing exponentially. Visit any dog park and see for yourself what happens when any male dog gets together with any female dog. They aren exactly discriminating in their romantic encounters. We already see signs of a dog centric culture. When did the dog stroller become ubiquitous? Why do we see water bowls for dogs outside restaurants when homeless people have to scrounge to get a drink? And airlines? The rules state that support dogs take priority over humans with allergies or aversions to the smells and potty problems that sometimes come with a canine passenger. Dogs are born with all the clothes they need on their backs, yet the dog clothing industry is a multi billion dollar business.

When people hear "skinny fat", people probably think of someone who looks kinda thin with clothes on, but without clothes has a bit loose belly and no definition whatsoever. The advice to lean bulk and then cut (maybe do a bit of recomping at maintenante at the very beginning) is for those people. However I noticed here that a lot of people are really bad at evaluating their own bodies and thus I seen people ranging from extremely underweighted all the way to obese call themselves skinny fat. Obviously the instructions for those extremes should differ from each other.

I also have swollen penis story, not as bad as that. First off had sex with the now ex wife. Must of been going at harder than normal cause after cleaning ourselves up, my dick is starting to look larger than normal (was still hard). I start feeling impressed with myself. The ex wife even notices saying why is it getting so big? Like bigger than a big bratwurst. But as I getting soft it starts staying bigger in only the shaft part near the tip. It starts getting scary, we go to the hospital. While waiting I go to the bathroom to check it out again, it worse looking but doesn hurt. After getting examined by the Dr, he says it nothing serious even though it looks like it is. Happens alot apparently. So I very relieved and start cracking jokes and get the Dr rolling. Made a comment about my dick basically having a lions main going on. The Dr is in tears laughing. The swelling goes away and I back to normal sizes.

Tl;dr, I thought it was weird that everyone is complaining about frozen food still being frozen after being in a microwave for a short period of time. I assumed that these people must be winging whatever they cooking (ie, leftovers), because why would they complain if there were instructions to read that they didn follow. It turns out you guys have higher wattage microwaves, and that direct frozen >microwave meals are a normal thing over there, and everyone complaining is for some reason not following instructions.

Social theorist Pierre Bourdieu would have described calling anti choice activists pro life as a form of "symbolic violence." For Bourdieu, the symbolic order of things is a way of keeping the status quo in place. Economy and culture rely on symbolic violence as a way of getting us to either ignore social inequality or to accept it as natural. The term "pro life" in supposedly objective journalism is a form of violence that marks those opposed to abortion rights as "ethical" and those in support of abortion rights as unethical sorts, selfish and self interested people who just want "choice" as if it the same as deciding between flavors of ice cream.. 
Each character is completely relatable to someone, and watching them overcome their flaws, or learn to how to deal with them when they become an issue, is likely to compel the audience to be introspective. Robin needs to learn to be vulnerable and depend on people in a healthy way, Lily and Marshall showcase the struggles of finding "the one" so young that you haven't found yourself yet, and Barney is everything wrong with hook up culture. I wish Ted had let go of Robin, and Robin and Barney had stayed together. Lily and Marshall are fine, but I'm so glad they'd added the chaos of choosing between each other's passions.

I was homeschooled by my religious parents until I was 14, and the "science" textbooks I was given were EXACTLY like this. It was even more pathetic though, because obviously high school science requires more detail/explanation than grade school. The desperate wrangling that had to go on to "prove" the earth was 6000 years old would be hilarious if not for the disturbing fact that so many people believe it with VICIOUS certainty. To this day I can go to museums with my parents, because every mention of "5 million years ago" etc sends them on a rant about "how could anyone not see this is intelligent design??" They both (otherwise) educated people, and it drives me nuts. Religion can turn anyone into a fool.

As a person who has been living in china for the more than 10 years, compared the previous 4 5 years, this year has really been decent, at least in Beijing. During winter, the AQI index used to reach 300 quite frequently, almost once a week, but now, we do not ever get 300, and the highest we get is a low 200, which happens once in two weeks. Yes, the AQI index from the chinese government may be misguided, but after living in Beijing for quite some time, you kind of know just by looking out the window the approximate air quality, and it really is better. We now see blue sky quite frequently. I really don know on what grounds are you saying worse than ever because it totally unfounded.

A lot of countries have a pandemic preparedness plan which tells them what to do, but that probably not enough. The health care sector is already at its limits.

The Celtic influence on English is responsible for the latter grammatical simplification which typifies the English language in comparison to other more synthetic Indo European languages to this day. For instance, the loss of grammatical cases is likely the result of Celtic influence; Old English had four inflectional cases but by the Middle English period, lost them all except for a vestigal genitive   all British Celtic languages also lacked inflectional cases. English also developed an auxiliary verb for emphatic purposes (I do love Askhistorians), a verbal construction that is also made use of by the British Celtic languages to emphasize another verb. Finally, English also developed a progressive present tense combining the verb be with a verbal noun (I am writing) which also appears to have been a linguistic construction borrowed from British Celtic.

When we hired two new people who were on her level, she had a long talk with me about how I needed to start concentrating on doing work for them. Her reasoning was that it was important to impress them, it was important to get exposed to different facets of our job, and as the junior person I needed to be available to help everyone, and I should focus more on them. So naturally they piled on assignments and I was splitting my time three ways. Shortly after our "Work with everyone" talk my manager slammed my door closed and started berating me for not focusing enough on her and the assignments that she was giving me. When I apologized and said some of her assignments didn have due dates or external deadlines so I was making them a lower priority, she scoffed and said "I your manager. You should be focusing on me." Any time she complimented my hair, blazer, or dress she was really effusive about it and I began to figure out that when she did that, at some point during the day we were going to have a talk about what I had done to displease her. (The "That is the ugliest effing skirt I have ever seen" Mean Girls scene comes to mind.) I walked on eggshells around her because one day I would be doing everything "great" and the next day she would be displeased with the way I did anything at all.

My friends in the LGBT+ community weren sure if they could stay here anymore; some left to more liberal areas, especially since open hatred and racism became almost acceptable.

The issue is that if you are not a citizen, or even if you are a citizen but are living with a non citizen, this question potentially gives you an incentive to lie to protect either yourself or the people you living with.

Much like the IRS doesn care if your income was made legally or not, the census doesn care if you here legally or not. It meant to be an accurate count of who is where, regardless of their legal status.

There is an increasing number of places that explicitly and shamelessly practice "believe the accuser" method of dealing with sexual assault cases. People have been denied representation, denied the right to face their accuser, denied cross examination, evidence viewed with absurd bias, etc. Often done to comically absurd degree. Such as many reported University cases. So the fear is very real and it not because of how likely it is to happen statistically but that you can end up in one of these spaces where you have no chance of justice. In fact the rarity shouldn be used as an excuse to play down this fear, it is more often than not the unlikely event that is the most horrifying. Not to mention the people that do make false allegations, even when it absolutely proven that it what they did, face no consequences.

I personally still hate the idea that you write one workout for your entire gym population, and then scale it down for a couple people, even if the workout ends up looking almost nothing like the original. There are some people who should have their workouts written specifically FOR THEM, individualized because of their needs. I mean, there's a reason there is an entire field of physical therapy dedicated to the elderly: their problems are unique and while their needs are TECHNICALLY the same as an elite athlete, the degree is so much different you can hardly call it the same thing.

That why it actually not very surprising that British Celtic imparted only about ten loanwords into English, but also why it very surprising that there is an absolute lack of Celtic influence on Old English syntax and sound system. This is likely because the British Celtic languages were regarded as very low prestige dialects spoken by marginal people with the lowest social status between the onset of Anglo Saxon colonisation and the Norman Conquest. The Norman Conquest is significant because the introduction of a new, Norman, ruling elite upset the previous binary between British Celtic and Anglo Saxon languages; there is indeed evidence of Celtic influence on the Middle English language which was made possible by English reduction in prestige, being replaced by Norman French.

And the first thing we could do was giving them vaccines for the diseases that are super easily transmitted like measles and chickenpox (the things that have previously killed uncontacted people).

EDIT: forgot to say but this kind of calculation os obviously too much ingame. Thats why i highly recommend knowing at least how to calculate basic pot odds or just remembering the basic milestones: 1/4 pot bet requires 17%, 1/3 20%, 1/2 25%, 2/3 29% , 3/4 30% and pot sized 33% Equity. A bet into an empty pot 50%. In this case if you remember the milestones you can remember that a 226BB shove into a 41BB pot is somewhat close to a bet into an empty pot, then take away a few percentages since 41BB is still something and give or take guess around 45% equity. Remember though this ONLY works in end of action spots. Dont use this reasoning vs a standard flop CBet or something.

When adult germ free mice were colonized with normal bacteria, they continued to show reduced anxiety like behaviors, suggesting that the absence of gut bacteria early in development has a permanent effect on the brain wiring related to anxiety and exploratory behavior.14, 16In contrast, when germ free mice were colonized early in life as pups or during adolescence and then tested in adulthood, normal anxiety like behavior was observed,13, 15 suggesting that microbiota influence the way the brain is wired early in development.17In addition to studying mice, researchers have used antibiotic treatment to manipulate gut bacteria. Exposure to antibiotics in drinking water has been shown to lead to reduced numbers of gut bacteria in mice and to a reduction in the diversity of the bacterial population.18 Consistent with work in germ free mice, mice exposed to antibiotics for a single week showed increased exploratory behavior and reduced anxiety like behavior, an observation that was linked to changes in the bacterial profile.19 Two weeks following the end of the antibiotic treatment, both the bacterial profile and the behavior returned to normal, suggesting that transient changes in gut microbiota can influence behavior.19Having established connections among gut bacteria, the brain, and behavior, it is intriguing to consider the ways that microbiota may communicate with the brain.

This elaborate mansion holds 38 bedrooms, 30 fireplaces, 42 bathrooms and 14 sitting rooms across 68,500 square feet and visitors are able to view portions of the home through one or more of the available tours. Shortly after Hearst death in 1951, the property was donated by the then Hearst Corporation and is now managed by the California State Parks as part of the San Simeon State Historical Monument. Located off of Highway 1 about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles near the city of San Simeon, the majority of visitors must take Highway 1 (Pacific Coast Highway), then Highway 46 towards Cambria to Hearst Castle Road, as a significant portion of Highway 1 from the north is currently inaccessible. While no lodging is available at Hearst Castle, a number of hotels can be found in San Simeon and Cambria, such as Blue Dolphin Inn, Cavalier Oceanfront Resort and the Morgan.

So one of the great veneers of civilization that everyone knows about the Romans was their baths   they some of the most famous architectural projects of the Romans, barring things like the Colosseum.

This design is carried through most of their models whether tube, hybrid, or solid state, so you can find similar functionality in most of their amps, with varying voicings and different sounds with different cabs, etc. I a bit more partial to the tube amps in general but the others aren bad either.

The turn is pretty safe, and he checks. I thought that was weird, thinking maybe he was hoping for a free river on a draw, since he could tell I was a little uncomfortable and might check back. I bet about 2/3 pot. Do I ever checkback here and try to pot control? I think I probably should, since it became apparent that I didn have a plan if he 3 bet me all in. After he instantly 3 bet me, I pretty much tanked for like 3 minutes. Idk where my head was, I was pretty all over the place, thinking about our dynamic. I was thinking, if he actually had a strong made hand and could sense I was uncomfortable, would he really be bombing it both on the flop and turn? I also kept thinking, could he really have it again? He had shown the nuts or 2nd nuts in like 3 hands within the last 30 minutes. Either you betting for value or you are bluffing and we have no reason to turn our hand into a bluff. I like checking back the turn and calling pretty much any river that doesn complete a draw or an ace.
She also made of my brother's speech impediment when she'd force him to read out loud. He started getting migraines so bad that he had to be medicated. My mom showed some real restraint by not scalping that cunt when she called for a PT conference with the Principal, IMO. We'd been out casually a couple of times.

Nothing too revealing, really just a super soft, slinky tank dress (easy access to all lady goods). Cuddled up to him on the couch. And nothing happened. No kiss, no nothing. Lol.

Divisible by 4 The number is divisible by 4 is the last two digits is also divisible by 4. Last two digits of 144 are 44 which are divisible by 4, thus 144 is divisible by 4 An alternative test: If the last digit plus twice the preceding digit is divisible by 4 then the whole number is divisible by 4. For 144, last digit + twice preceding digit is 4+2x4 = 12 which is divisible by 4, so 144 is divisible by 4 .

The enormous cast of characters is sometimes rather confusing, but film is unfussy and straightforward, relentlessly entertaining as it piles on wry comedy and dark feeling. Green walks off with the movie as the staggeringly ruthless Ava, vamping through each scene without bothering to put on any clothing while revealing her own weaknesses along the way. Her scenes with Brolin are surprisingly involving emotionally, as is the desperation that pushes Alba's and Gordon Levitt's characters, two tenacious young people trying to right the wrongs of their past, probably without any hope of success.

A related argument is that domestic political processes can hamstring a government in the great game of poker or chess that international politics is supposed to be. In high stakes negotiations, the last thing the players need is public debate about the cards that each of them holds.

Used to work for Apple   No, they won ship parts in from outside the country to service a non AU phone. If it couldn be serviced here it was a "Sorry, but you need to facilitate getting the phone back to the country of origin to have it serviced". Kogan bought phones were always hell to deal with, because a lot of the time they were frakenstein from multiple different phones or even outright marked as stolen from US Apple Stores or Internal serial  not matching external or SIM tray which was a flat "no, this can never be serviced by Apple.". It a lot easier now to replace iPhones with the international models being the same, but I would never ever recommend buying an iPhone from Kogan just on the risk that it not a 100% original device from a country that shares the same model.
Not a good indicator either way.

Inventive and unique crepe fillings, along with enticing baguette sandwiches and Parisian inspired starters, pepper the new and improved menu at A Cafe, formerly Arlene's Creperie Bistro and, before that, Crepes a la Carte on Broadway in Boulder.Along with the menu revamp, you'll find sweeping changes inside A Cafe.An ambitious makeover has transformed the once nondescript crepe joint into a quaint, cozy, Parisian style cafe complete with chandeliers, exposed brick, hobnail framed mirrors and woven rattan bistro armchairs.

If you want your best chance of winning money, play poker. In casino style poker, you aren playing against the casino, so the game isn rigged against you (meaning all the players theoretically have the same chance of winning). The casino makes it revenue from poker by taking a rake (a small percentage of every pot) so no one at the table has an inherent advantage over another.

Hey doc, we read your book Mindsight for a UCLA extension course I took recently and it was great. And we discussed a related Tedx talk of yours, which was also cool. It always pleases me to hear accomplished people talk about the oneness of existence. It's become clear to me that whether it's science, spirituality, art, love, or you name it, the story being told is always the same. From ancient prophets to modern physicists and everything in between, it's all just one story with countless expressions. When the Universe is seen from a holographic standpoint, it makes sense why any one aspect can be used to understand the whole of it. But just as the naked eye can see everything except itself, our meaningful and invaluable quest for full understanding will always fall short. It's a beautiful paradox. Anyway, can't wait to read Aware and now onto my sorta question.

If you have a cover you can remove and look down into the septic, it will look "full" all the time. The water level will be high and that is normal. If you just see water, with some waste particles/scum; that is normal too. If it looks like a heavy coating of scum; it is probably time to pump it out. My granparents never had theirs pumped out. They had it replaced after the tank itself (a metal tank) was finally at failing point (it was around 30 years old i think at that point and the state required cement). So it is possible, but not likely that it will never get pumped. Also never use anything like ridex or septic treatment. That stuff just causes the soilds to stay in suspension and get pushed out into the drain field and it will clog the holes in the pipes over time.

Any article written about self help must have a disclaimer, so here it is. You cannot treat, diagnose or prescribe for yourself or family. You must see your physician who is licensed to do those three things. You have the right to educate yourself and family and to maintain your general health. Be wise, pay attention, only do what feels right to you and do not treat any natural remedy as though it is the same as, or replacement for, necessary medicines. Never feel that you have to choose to either use natural remedies or medicines. you should use everything and anything that helps you and your family maintain its health and wellness. You should also express thankfulness that multiple systems of wellness exist. Be responsible.

If you could give a guarentee that using IDs would prevent people from being wrongly disenfranchised, then I would have to take a deeper look at the issue. Or maybe if it could help institute a system that let you vote anywhere in the state (say a barcode on your id with your county that would automatically pull up your ballet at the voting booth). Or even if it was just thrown into an overall voting bill that had good provisions for increasing access (making voting a national holiday in all states, automatic registration, increased voting hours/days, etc) as a compromise.

Vast majority of humans don experience any long lasting consequences from transient infections. But there may be subset of patients who are genetically predisposed to this effect by mechanisms we don yet understand yet. Our hope is that this work will open another avenue for exploring, understanding and treating these very complex syndromes. particular, electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment resistant depression; this research may help researchers better understand and optimize this new approach.
In set theory zero is the least cardinal number, in propositional logic it denotes falsity, in abstract algebra it is a neutral element. It has a funny place in describing temperature: in Kelvin it is really the end of cold, while in Celsius it sort of means the end though there are negative numbers below it in Fahrenheit it is just another plain number, not really marking anything particular at all in the scheme of temperatures.

Hand 5: I honestly thought about checking this back on the river; on the turn I was hoping he had A5 or A4 so I didn't think the river was too great for us. But I try to keep myself from thinking shit like "well this is the worst full house I can have so I have to check", especially considering the stack size.
