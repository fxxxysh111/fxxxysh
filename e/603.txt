Honestly, America would be that kid who's parents are constantly fighting and, as a result, does wildly inconsistent in school   either academically or in sports   depending on how things are going at home that week. Sometimes America comes to school happy, smiling, joking around, maybe ace a few quizzes or help win the football game. Then sometimes America comes to school with dirty clothes, bullies other students, lashes out at teachers, and half asses everything. Some of the faculty and some of America's closer friends are concerned because they know America is generally good at heart but can't really help with the root causes. Other students and faculty that have only had brief interactions with America will either think America is the stereotypical dumb jock bully because it punched them in the face or put tacks on their chair once, while others don't know what the fuss is about.

We're part of a biologically classified group known as continuous breeders, which means that we mate or breed year round. Seasonal breeders, like bears or chipmunks, have changes in fertility and sexual activity depending on the time of year. The females of these species experience an estrous cycle only during certain times, which introduces physiological and behavioral changes that lead to increased sexual activity. If conception doesn't take place the endometrial lining in the uterus is reabsorbed.

Our gendered identities can and should be inclusive. There no need for these weird divisions between the genders.

Causing further severance and divide doesn help, because you still share a country with the people on the opposite side. Common ground has to be found or it will just become more and more conflict.

This has potentially interesting consequences in repeated play of the game. We also show that in a simplified version of the game with P>5, there is one equilibrium solution if 5P . This may be the simplest non trivial multiplayer poker game with more than one distinct equilibrium solution and provides us with a test case for theories of dynamic strategy adjustment over multiple realisations of the game.We then study a third order system of ordinary differential equations that models the dynamics of three players who try to maximise their expectation by continuously varying their betting frequencies.

Make a bluff when cards are dealt that will possibly have weakened your opponents hand. If your opponent has called on a J 7 2 flop and the turn brings a 7, then this is not a good time to bluff as any pair your opponent may hold will still be as strong as before but he probably doesn't have trip 7s. If instead of 7 the turn comes down a K, then it is not looking so good now because some one (maybe you) may have paired Ks on the flop; so they are more likely to fold Js or 7s, if you betted/bluffed as if you may now have a pair of Kings.

In the late 1940s he accepted an invitation from his casino owner friend, Benny Binion, to move to the newly burgeoning Las Vegas and play a high stakes game against Nick 'The Greek' Dandalos. The match was said to have lasted for five months. When Nick the Greek finally stood up from the table for the last time and infamously announced "Mr. Moss, I have to let you go", the Texan had won in excess of $2'000'000   a momentous fortune in 1949. Over the following sixty years, the Moss Dandalos encounter become enshrouded in mystery but remains one of the enduring gambling tales from Vegas' early days.

Persistent or intractable hiccups are more common in men than in women and tend to occur during adulthood. Charles Osborne, who hiccuped for 68 years (1922 1990), earned the Guinness Book of World Records title for Longest Hiccup Attack. A Florida teenager named Jennifer Mee hiccuped for five long weeks in 2007 only to have them return a few weeks later (she is hiccup free as of this posting). Another Florida resident, Jaime Molisee, hiccuped for more than eight months. David Willis of Northern Ireland has undergone two unsuccessful surgeries in an effort to end his five year hiccup ordeal.

Manage the end game: You need to know how much money you have remaining, how much money other teams have remaining, and especially how much money your key rivals have remaining. And for the record "key rival" is not the person with whom you talk trash; rather, he or she is the fantasy owner who needs what you need. If there is one good shortstop left and you and your adversary both need a shortstop, it makes sense to call out that shortstop if and only if you have more money than your adversary. If not, wait to see if your adversary spends his/her money on another need and this gives you the financial advantage

Going off my mother who has hoarding tendencies, she has depression stemming from watching her parents slowly die over a decade. To cope with said depression, she buys stuff, like furniture and books, to make herself feel better. It rarely expensive stuff but there so much of it and she refuses to get rid of anything because she got too good of a deal on it or she has a sometimes imagined emotional connection to the object. She never does anything to help herself other than buy more crap, so she gets more depressed and buys more crap, so it stacks higher and higher each year.

This is akin to using the vacuum cleaner to push dirt under the rug rather than suck it up and throw it out. This clearly contradictory stance will be expressed after the Obama administration released memos detailing the sort of torture that occurred in the (not so) secret prisons of the Bush regime.

I don support Trump, but I can totally see how he can use these issues to invalidate anything Cohen says that can be independently verified. It can clearly be used to galvanize his base against all of the testimony. I have always said from the beginning that the Democrats need to make sure that their case is iron clad. By allowing the testimony of suspect actors who could still be puppets of the President, they risk their entire case. Stick to the facts that can be discovered by known good people and information.
One kid came in every Monday and his weekend food backpack was filthy. Every Monday it was the same way (covered in dirt or mud). Noticing the trend, a volunteer asked why his backpack was always so dirty. He said when he got off the bus on Fridays he would stash the backpack and it contents under his porch. When he was hungry, he would sneak out and crawl under the porch to eat some food. This poor child had to hide his food and eat under a porch in the dirt so his parents wouldn eat his food.

Just to be clear, because this is a topic I could stand to have a better grasp of, the reason Walmart can use point of sale data in the same way is that they don have access to, say, Costco practices on the same level, because they don themselves sell Costco goods for them; those two supermarkets are directly competing sale points, not a hub for multiple sellers one tier above to congregate.

Agree with badRLplayer. His examples are incredibly superficial. I would argue PGH has done an incredible amount of damage to the diversity of roles women are seen as capable of succeeding in. My wife (korean) fumes at how her incompetence or failure is at times portrayed as being related to her gender, often as an excuse put forth by her own ultraconservative supporters. I would argue that she was chosen almost entirely based on her connection to her father, rather than due to her quite meager legislative accomplishments prior to becoming president. So I believe her legacy is damaging to women who want to achieve in Korea through their hard work and ability.

Although certainly not the intention, the Crusades of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries acquainted the European population with Arabian ideas and fostered an appreciation of Eastern aromatics, despite repeated warnings by the Christian priesthood that fragrance was associated with Satan.

My partner and I started dating at 16 and we both thought kids would just happen one day, but as I gotten older I become more and more convinced that I never want to have kids. We talked about it many times over the years and while he still be open to having kids, he told me he rather be with me, kids or not. He also enjoys our carefree lifestyle and all the travel we do. I always asked him to tell me if that ever changes because I don want to keep him in a marriage that will leave him unhappy without kids. I still not 100% certain it never happen, but about 95% sure. I be 30 this year and my IUD will bring me to age 32. At that point I will look into whether I want to be sterilized or do one more iud. I won ask my partner to get sterilized because it not what he wants for his body, and if something happened to me and he moved on with someone else, he should have the option to have kids with them if he wants.

There are a few options when it comes to joining Planet Fitness. One level of membership is the "Black Card," which costs $19.99 a month and requires a 12 month commitment; this membership includes a t shirt, unlimited tanning where available, 50% off cooler drinks, unlimited use of massage chairs where available, and unlimited guest privileges.

Answer  South Carolina must take several specific steps to deal with the budget shortfalls. First, the state took an important step toward responsible budgeting by raising the cigarette tax several weeks ago. Second, the state must enact comprehensive tax reform. Third, we must require our state Department of Revenue to crack down on tax cheats. It's not right for some people to avoid paying taxes while the rest of us carry the load. Finally, and most importantly, our state must do a better job prioritizing where our tax dollars are spent.

A professor responsible for grading 300 term papers no longer needs to sniff out suspect sentences or paragraphs that seem vaguely out of place. Most colleges and universities, and many high schools, use programs such as Turnitin, which detect plagiarized content like magnetic wands detect metal. Students submit assignments using an online portal, the program scans the text, and when the teacher signs on to look at the batch of work, they can see what percentage of each paper contains recycled material and where every flagged line has been taken from.

Octopath Traveler announced as a new mobile game, not a portSome might argue that Octopath Traveler being a Nintendo Switch exclusive meant it was already a mobile game. Square Enix will make the difference clear. For whatever reason, some game developers create completely unique gameplay experiences based on their existing properties and not bother naming it something else entirely. For example, Resident Evil 2 is one of the best games of the year despite it also being the same title as the 1998 game of which it originated. Octopath Traveler looks to follow that same logic. The Switch exclusive was a beautiful title that definitely wasn't afraid to try new things (even if they didn't always work), and apparently, it was successful enough to warrant a follow up or two. Square Enix has officially announced the next game in what is now the Octopath Traveler series, and this one is headed to mobile devices.

No merit in shoving because we fold out everything We beat(AK, A5s, A2s, A8s(unlikely)) and keep everything in that we lose to(JJ, AA, 88).

In terms of proper poker strategy the sizing is donk as fuck. It way too big. Leaves behind a 1/4 or smaller bet OTT. Impossible to balance. Missing value when you have it, risking way too much when you don The best way to get money in the pot is bet the same amount relative to the size of the pot on each street. If he bets 75 into 180 and gets a caller he has 130 behind and there 330 in the pot, around 40pct each street. Betting 100 into 180 and picking up a caller = there 380 in the pot and he has 105 behind. Anyone who has a clue is gonna recognize that he have a tiny fraction of the pot behind when called and thus can never bluff turns, since he can be bluffing turns he can be bluffing flop either, as a flop bet would be sized such that if it doesn work there would be sufficient room to maneuver on the next street and decide whether or not to fire an additional barrel.
