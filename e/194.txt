A step to ensuring positive liberty at the end of slavery would have been to return the land that the slaves worked to them, allowing them to provide for themselves and secure a life through their work. (That some libertarian socialist thinking.)At the end of your post there, I not talking about like physical security, I talking about job security, financial security, the security of knowing you will be provided with health care. It a big part of why anxiety is on the rise in america, there is not even a basic expectation that you could keep your job, that your rent won change randomly, that you won be entirely ruined by an unexpected bill.Rights don guarantee positive liberty, and specifically American rights don ensure material security (the thing you need to create positive liberty) for the average person.There an old saying that "What good is the right to free speech if you dead." And that the difference.

This is actually true. Original intelligence assessments were created when quite a few people were immigrating to the United States. People who weren thrilled about this (essentially eugenicists) used American IQ tests to "prove" that white people were superior to other races. The problem was twofold. First, the test was in English, which puts anyone whose first language isn English at a systematic disadvantage. Second, many items, particularly free response style items, included questions about United States history and popular culture. This has gotten better over time to a degree, but when IQ tests created and normed in the US are administered to individuals not from the US, or who haven lived in the US for a substantial amount of time, multiple new sources of variance are introduced into the equation, and it quite possible that their score on the test is a reflection of language or cultural barriers rather than actual intellectual functioning. (Let me know if you have any questions! I a Clinical Psychology PhD student interested in psychological assessment.)

My mother in law got me an Ancestry DNA test for Christmas 2017. A month ago, I got a Close Family match from someone with just initials, then saw the managing name which matched my cousin's wife's name. (This is all on my father's side; I haven't spoken to most of that family, including my father, in 20 years.) When I messaged my cousin's wife and asked if the initials were my aunt, she said yes, and then dropped the bomb: my aunt and 2 of her siblings, not including my father (there are 12 of them), took the DNA test to see if they were full siblings.

It's not tribal to point out how people are acting, and it's not equal on both sides. Yes Democrats occasionally do dumb shit too, especially by being too pc. I understand the goal of pc and I'm not against it, but how it's implemented can sometimes drive moderate voters away and hurt what Democrats are hoping to achieve, and doing that is dumb. (For example, a recent women's support march that was cancelled because they felt they didn't have enough women of color.). But that small portion of dumbness is like a teaspoon compared to the tsunami of stupidity that Republicans and their supporters exhibit over and over again.

It was once the case that in most of our community life, wealth was equated with work, the symmetry between the two inviolate. This endowed employment with a sense of meaning and status within the community that reflected its importance. But, with increasing amounts of wealth now being generated without labour at all, work itself is seen as more incidental than essential. A generation ago, we believed wealth would increase in dramatic terms and that jobs would be available for everyone. It now clear we miscalculated and that wealth and work are no longer indivisible.

If they don already, the airport needs to post a large sign indicating that all taxis are fixed fares from the airport including the fare map so that no one sets foot in a cab without knowing whats up. There is no reason to allow any confusion given that the system has already implemented fixed fares and we all know what can happen if its left up to the honesty of the taxi drivers. When I have visited countries in Asia I have always been weary of getting ripped off by cabs, so if there were mandated prices and fare maps indicated inside the airport or curbside, I could verify before I stepped in the taxi and I would be stoked.

Strip poker is just like any other poker game. The difference in playing strip poker is that players strip items of clothing when they lose a bet. Strip poker has been with us for ages, and contrary to popular belief, strip poker is originally not a sensual, erotic game. Poker developed hundreds of years ago, and strip poker originated from the basic game of poker. Because poker enables one to win while others are losing, the losers then can bet their clothing. This is to take back their cash from the winning opponent. Before, items of clothing are considered of special value.

Again this entirely depends on the contract. Contractors may have as many as three companies taking money out of salary before it gets to them. On some projects, yes, the contractor will make more that a civilian but this doesn always hold true. Government jobs are extremely well paid. Contractors do not get a pension. Those pensions in some cases are worth more money then I probably ever see. It tricky without knowing the actual work OP has been doing previously, but I think with 5 years experience, OP should be looking at a level 2 software or systems engineer position at around $75k on the safe side, or at a level 3 (engineer III, "staff engineer," or even "senior engineer," depending on the company) at $80k $100k on the more ambitious side. This is pretty inline with the statistics for Raytheon, LockMart, Boeing. The specifics will depend on the nature of OP experience and the role he/she applies for. It is certainly possible to earn over $100k with a CS degree and 5 years experience, even in Huntsville, but that speaks more to the tails of the distribution and is probably not a good expectation to set for every mid level Software Engineering job in the area.

Why wait until he dies to ask his wife for his things? I don think OP here is in a position to forgive or mend the relationship or go against here husbands wishes. If anything, I believe this should be labeled as NAH, just overall a very sad situation.

The answer can be provided in one   or rather, three   words: The Tea Party! , partisan polarisation, and the rightward thrust in contemporary American politics derive from the Tea Party's takeover of the Republican Party, which in turn has enabled the Tea Party to paralyse Congress and the entire American government.

Seated Overhead Press: Sit on the ball with correct posture (stomach tight, shoulders back, head up, back straight, and hips directly beneath you) and push a weight from shoulder level to above your head. Your back should stay flat during the movement and if you have to significantly increase the curve in your low back, you are using too much weight.

All of these muscle activations will strengthen your core muscles.

From there, the long postganglionic neurons extend across most of the body.[3]The two exceptions mentioned above are postganglionic neurons innervating sweat glands release acetylcholine for the activation of muscarinic receptors   and the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system, and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion: synapses occur between pre  and post  ganglionic neurons within it, but the post ganglionic neurons do not leave the medulla; instead they directly release norepinephrine and epinephrine into the blood.[5]The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for up  and down regulating many homeostatic mechanisms in living organisms.

That article you referenced, Republicans were wildly successful at suppressing voters in 2016 is sensationalist, inflamatory, and so obviously a "poor loser" attempt by the losing party, it made me laugh.

Another article claims the losses in Wisconsin were due to the ballot machines being tampered with. A little overkill, don you think?

If atomic decay were happening at 1000x the speed it happens today, it also going to be producing 1000x the heat.And that amount of heat would cook the Earth.Cepitore  4 points  submitted 9 days agoHow much extra heat would be produced if the decay rate was going at an increased rate for roughly 6 months? Also consider that the objective of the flood was to destroy the planet, so there would be a certain level of catastrophic heat that would still fit the narrative.This is all hypothetical, so if we are assuming there is something wrong with radiometric dating data, we couldn't even be sure that pressure was the sole cause of inflated dating calculations so we can't just chalk it all up as 100% due to increased decay rate.My point is, under these hypothetical assumptions, we don't know how much of the misinterpreted data is due to inconsistent decay, and therefore it's tough to guess how much heat the process produced.The main question is still, can pressure possibly alter decay rate? If yes, how much does it take, and if no, why?We just had a treatment on /r/debateevolution that attempted to put a number on this: they took the current heat gradient due to isotopic decay heat, and rolled it backwards to produce the numbers for a 6000 year old Earth assuming we got the decay rates wrong.This isn quite the scenario you asked about, but it fairly similar: instead of a one off event, it a constant rate change, so your scenario would produce a far higher peak temperature; it would still release the same amount of energy over time, so your 6 month scenario would be several thousand times hotter than this.Anyway, 1km underground would be 10x as hot as the sun, which I suggest is probably wrong.

Oh, they crumble up on the floor after work just like you would. That why CPS departments across this country have such a tremendous turnover rate for employees. It an incredibly hard job to do emotionally/mentally and many people can make it past 3 5 years doing the work. CPS in my state has such a bad attrition rate that those left working are chronically overworked and under supported due to understaffing and of course that just perpetuates the cycle of people leaving soon. So if you work in CPS here for more than two years you considered a freaking veteran employee.

The solution turned out to be about 5ish lines, with an out of the box email parser I found on github. But getting to that github repository and understanding how to use it required so much Googling around and reading documentation about email formatting standards etc etc that I still felt challenged the entire way through.

Many classic Twilight Zone tails have been retold without reference or allusion and many more have been parodied as cliche, but what made these stories so resonant (as I see it) was that, in the post WW2 world, conventionally existential anxieties were made tangible.In the 1950 America reconstruction from the Second World War was psychological compared to the rest of the worlds very physical reconstruction. The land was unscathed, but the people had seen firsthand what war meant, and this says nothing of The Bomb. For many Americans the question of when the horrors of war would come to American soil was not a question of if, but when, and would they be able to confront it when it did.

13th. (Courtesy Netflix)">DuVernay's latest documentary feature is The 13th, a sobering look at the prison industrial complex that will open the New York Film Festival on September 30   the first time the NYFF has ever selected a work of nonfiction as its opening film. (Netflix and limited theatrical releases will follow on October 7.) If its title sounds like that of a horror film, that's appropriate: The 13th sheds light on a real terror, visited upon real human beings. Constitution, which officially abolished slavery. Yet it also retained an unfortunate loophole, doing away with involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." The clause has made it possible to arrest American citizens (primarily black American citizens) on flimsy charges, fine them at rates they can't pay, jail them, abuse them, and steal their labor. DuVernay's film tracks these practices from their origins to the present day. Zipping from clip to clip like a racism supercut, The 13th jumps between archival footage of George Wallace pledging allegiance to segregation and choice modern day pundit quotes, then splices in TV and viral video of, say, the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting or protests following the killing of Trayvon Martin. Each three  or four second clip adds support to the argument like a brushstroke on a painting, mixing past and present to prove that history did not come from nowhere, nor is the present moment separate from history. Brought together in one place, the footage makes hauntingly visible the ways in which the justice system has criminalized African Americans, destroying families, promoting negative stereotypes, and ruining individual lives, at least since the ratification of that suspicious amendment in 1865.
He attended Cooper Union but dropped out in 1971 and by 1973 was teaching calculus and physics at Dalton, where he tutored the son of a Bear Stearns exec. 
On the other side, even if we put aside Israeli control of land, borders, economy, food, education, and virtually every facet of life in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, Israel directly maintains power over the lives of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, some convicted in military courts (illegal under the Geneva Conventions), and others, including elected members of the Palestinian parliament, imprisoned under administrative detention orders (similarly illegal).

So your own argument that parents' inequality creates advantages and disadvantages for their children demonstrates that are wrong that inequality does not exist.

HOWEVER, there are far more men in higher positions compared to women. Women tend to flood entry level positions and not move up due to various reasons. THIS is where the wage gap occurs. What you see in the media is a statistical misinterpretation of this phenomenon. Additionally, it shows us that there is still a huge issue. Why are men more likely to be an executive? Why aren't women moving up? Signs point to it being a combination of sexism AND cultural norms. Additionally, child rearing is sure to play a role as many women drop out of the workforce, which also affects results.

As I am all for a bit of help when it comes to giving parents information on useful sites to block and with younger kids I would definitely monitor them a whole lot more. When they hit their teens though and can just access this stuff anyway they still need to know the reasons why we as adults (mainly) don view gore/snuff/ISIS videos or else they will just look it up on whatever fringe website will host it. Unless you think that you can convince teens to just accept an internet banning as well, which would never fly.. 
Why not go to a nursing home and visit the people living there? Here are men and women, who many times have no family close by. Just coming by and saying hi, sharing a smile, and bringing some flowers to brighten the room can do wonders. Remember that these are people's mothers, fathers, grandparents. Share your heart with them. You wouldn't believe how full your heart will feel. Or you can go by a hospital (Call first, for each hospital has different policies). You may volunteer in the children's ward, hell maybe the cardiology ward for that matter. If this idea makes you queasy, than simply donate a pint of blood. And then you can go home and watch "My Bloody Valentine"! OK, that part's definitely optional.

February came, and with it, layoffs. I was one of the first to go, and while I was told it wasn because of these things, many others who were pushing back were let go with me. This lead to 6 months of unemployment, the emptying of my savings to stay afloat, and a total career shift.
That my issue I would like different. Hypothetical Example: I go on Camping Trip A, have my gear list. Another few weeks I want to go on Camping Trip B and I duplicate my list from Trip A. However I made some small tweaks and I like to change my list accordingly. My "food" is only 18oz on Trip B instead of 30oz on Trip A. Also I found some tags made of lead I overlooked on 3 pieces of gear and trimmed an ounce off each so I need to update those. Finally I cut 2oz off of my pack due to straps. I want to make those changes and not have Trip A be impacted. In an ideal world, Trip A can be locked and nothing can ever be altered on it by anything I do unless I manually unlock it.

Stout's investment in Resorts International pays off handsomely   and his personal investment account, on which BAM's compliance staff and his boss Carter keep an eye, becomes massive for a man still in his 20s. Such victories encourage Stout to take on bigger risks. He researches the potential impact on oil prices if the Shah were to be overthrown in Iran and dips his toe into the dangerous world of commodities trading. He considers short selling bonds   based on the view that inflation could trigger an increase in interest rates and make the bond market collapse. As Stout wades into these potentially treacherous waters, his business associates issue a warning. Carter tells Stout that he imagines he is "an oil market maven and a Fed policy seer wrapped in a packet labeled HUBRIS in capital letters." Everything seems a little too rosy.

Malgr la progression constante du christianisme, les rites paens surent rester vivaces. Au dogme ecclsiastique s l de pratiques multi millnaires.

Au lieu de vindicte et d'anathme, elle devint peu  peu relativement tolrante face  ces rites forcment idoltres. En amadouant et en les absorbant, comme une amibe gloutonne le ferait d microbe, la chrtient dtourna ces rites de leurs destinations originelles.

This is possible if we accept Peter Schrijver thesis that Old Irish is actually Proto Irish that only arrived in Ireland sometime around the Roman Conquest of Britain: this would explain the complete lack of dialectical variation in Old Irish and a series of dramatic sound changes between 400 600 which could be explained by the rapid adoption of Old Irish by an indigenous population who previously spoke another, possibly non Indo European, language..

The Common Personality of People Born in Horse Year People born in the year of the horse are extremely animated, active and energetic. Horses love to be in a crowd and like entertainment, they have a deft sense of humor, they love to take center stage and delight audiences everywhere. They are trustworthy, friendly and like to be surrounded by their relatives and friends. They usually have a large circle of acquaintances, but they never rely on their friends too much. Sometimes, the horse is a little self centered, but it doesn't mean that he will not be interested in any problems except his own. However, a horse person is really more cunning than intelligent, that is probably due to the fact that most horse people lack confidence. Sometimes, they are very independent and rarely listen to advice

Cache memory (which can come in various "levels", describing how far away from the main CPU each memory bank is) is used to keep copies of data from the main memory in a location that is "closer" to the CPU, and thus faster to access and use. Registers are memory located directly inside the CPU's execution units   think of them as scratch space where the CPU can temporarily store small amounts of data while it does a calculation.

It is true that not a single feature of British Celtic has been convincingly identified in the morphology and syntax of Old English; the two aspects of language where a historical linguist would expect to find influence from a substrate language, as adults who acquire a second language (especially in the context of the arrival of a new political/social elite over an indigenous population) as a rule find it more difficult to master pronunciation and sentence structure than learning new vocabulary. Indeed, think of a monolingual English speaker learning French; they have little effort learning French words but may struggle with pronouncing unfamiliar sounds like a uvular trill and will often substitute the closest approximate from English. Over time these substitutions solidify into concrete linguistic changes..

From the way OP worded his question, I can see why you brought it up, but I think he was just duplicating the wording of the original quote from the website (which you right, isn good). But the root of the question was what the percentage should be, not how odds work.
Since these are independent, though sequentially related events, to compute the probability that both events occur, you simply multiply the two probabilities together. 2 in 52 times 1 in 51 is 2 in 2652, or about 0.0007541. (Full Answer).

A healthy balance of assimilation and accommodation is important.
