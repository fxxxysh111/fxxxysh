Oh, looks like they using the old school method of just shoving everyone into 1 session with a bunch of flights and taking all day. A lot of meet directors these days split the day up into 2 sessions with a 1 hour break in between. 
Oh that's nothing. I evicted my last tenants when I found they were keeping two dogs in cages in the basement (in their own piss and shit) and extra people were living with them in places that weren't even legal rooms. They were hoarders. They decided to throw half their shit into the state protected wetlands behind the house (still my property, and I would have been fined for it during the yearly state inspection). It took weeks of bleach treatments to get the dog smell out of the cement floor in the basement. We lugged truckloads of stuff out of the wetlands and had to pay to dump it all. All of the carpets were replaced and they also left the propane tank (which they were responsible for filling at the end of the lease) bone dry. The security deposit didn't come close to covering the damage. I ended up selling to my next tenant and he even still found some stuff buried in the wetlands when he went to do work on the place. Thankfully he was very chill about it.
Those three have fairly powerful situational ults (wiped a whole team with gib ult once which was fun) but overall the speed at which I get downed when playing as them ruins the fun for me.CherryCokeFTW559  63 points  submitted 27 days agoThe only thing I would like to reiterate on is please don be influenced by what streamers say the game needs to be or by the small 1 percent of professional players. 
Features of Lawn TennisIt is particularly easy to identify the main features of tennis, because it is so well known across the world. The court is 23.8m (78ft) long and 11m (36ft) wide. The service boxes are 6.4m (21ft) from the net, and a single service box is 4.1m (13ft 6in) wide. The tramlines are 1.4m (4ft 6in) wide, and are only used for doubles' matches. These surfaces affect the way that play goes, and the way that the tennis ball travels on court.

That not to say there isn progress being made, just that it incremental and at a small scale. I see with my own eyes, in a trend that reflected in society at large, that every generation of scientists is more progressive and more thoughtful about social issues. Grad students now discuss which labs offer the best lifestyle and most accommodating bosses, while I don think those issues came up at all when I was a student a decade ago. PIs too are starting to realize the role they play in perpetuating a system that no one thinks is sustainable. Not too long ago a departmental head was bemoaning that none of the female investigators ever took much maternity leave. Another faculty member pointed out that when the chair had his first kid, he was back in lab the next day, and how could he expect his subordinates to take time off with the example he was setting? Last year Mr. Chair had kid number two, and he deliberately took a month and a half off. While I don doubt that he spent most of that time writing grants and reviewing papers, it was absolutely a step in the right direction. These changes will take time, but they will slowly change the culture in academia.but unfortunately too slowly for me. I getting out soon. Academia just isn compatible with the lifestyle I want.

RE your point that the laws targeted East Asians, the anti Asian immigration laws in the US also included South Asians which is why there was barely any Indian immigration to the US pre 1965.

Judging from your comments in this thread, you have a bad attitude about dating, you seem to have an inflated self worth ("I have so much more going for me in my life than most guys",) and you complain that the only women you can get to hook up with you are "so so." You probably just a normal person who thinks he more attractive and charismatic than he is; you are only pursuing women out of your league and then thinking "IT THEIR FAULT THEY NOT INTO ME!" In my opinion, you don need a dating coach, you need to turn the mirror on yourself. If you haven had success while actively pursuing a relationship in ten years, that indicates that the problem in this equation is most likely not women but, rather, you..

We had no sooner come to an Anchor in Royal Bay, as before mentioned, than a great number of the Natives in their Canoes came off to the Ship and brought with them Cocoa Nuts, etc.; these they seem'd to set a great value upon. Amongst those that came off to the Ship was an elderly man whose Name was Owhaa, him the Gentlemen that had been here before in the Dolphin ( Lieutenant Gore and Mr. Molineux, the Master.) knew and had often spoke of as one that had been of Service to them. This man (together with some others) I took on board and made much of, thinking that he might on some occasions be of use to us. As our stay at this place was not likely to be very short, I thought it very necessary that some order should be observed in Traficking with the Natives, that such Merchandize as we had on board for that purpose might continue to bear a proper value, and not leave it to everyone's own particular fancy, which could not fail to bring on Confusion and Quarrels between us and the Natives, and would infallibly lessen the value of such Articles as we had to trafick with.

But rather than a mother fearing passengers reactions, I rather we created a society where a mother might have reason to expect kindness and empathy instead. If she hadn had given these out, would passengers reactions have been harsher? The gifts are a nice gesture, but we collectively ought not need to be bribed to put that into consideration. We should see a crying baby and automatically excuse her and her mother. Minding a four month old baby in a confined unfamiliar space for 10 hours should be something we presume to pity, not secretly despise or directly confront. We oughtn need it in writing that we should look on her with forgiveness. A kinder, gentler world wouldn see a need for this kind of gesture. Let look softly on all babies in airplanes or any public transit for that matter. Let treat every mother and child as if they have just given us a "sorry, here a sweet" package.

Are you serious? Republicans shit the bed when a Democrat says a bad word in private, but they can yell "go back to Puerto Rico" to their colleagues while in session. Did you forget that the Republican president tried to deny disaster relief funding and purposefully acted slowly resulting in the current shit show. The democrats visit and suddenly that is a bad thing. They are our countrymen and deserve to be acknowledged. Your inability to see how this is offensive demonstrates your lack of maturity, and I think you should question your own grasp of logic.

There are also sites that offer online sports betting, which is another form of gambling. These sites allow users to place bets on athletic competitions of every kind, as well as other events like political races or the outcomes of reality TV shows. The sites offer their own odds, which in some cases are better than the odds offered by the traditional Las Vegas bookmakers (due, in part, to the lower overhead required to run an online betting site). Many online casinos offer "instant play" versions of their games, which usually run within a Web browser using Java. Players can also download the casino's software and play the games in a separate application. Some sites only offer a download to play option. Players can try out the games for free using a play account filled with a few thousand dollars. The constant, in home accessibility is the biggest problem.

What others say: Bob Dalton, 49, of Niwot has been doing Meridian stretching with Busch for about a year. He's an avid skier and says he's noticed an increase in strength in the end ranges of movement and that's kept him on his feet more successfully on the slopes. "I was a bit skeptical at first. I thought it would be more like a massage   it's not like that at all. Now, if I had to choose to do this or just lift weights, I would do this. It gives you real world, practical fitness," he says.

Sirius was also emotionally and psychologically ruined by spending 12 years in Azkaban for a crime he didn commit. And during those 12 years he wasn able to form any kind of bond with Harry. And afterwards he was always on the run. 
If an offer was put in (and presumably accepted), backing out of a deal shouldn be an option. You can try to talk to the seller but he/she would be under no obligation to accept the offer being rescinded. Worse yet, if the seller puts the property back on the market and receives less, she could be on the hook for the difference.. 
The solution is to embrace uncertainty by calibrating our confidence: Rather than expressing 100 percent certainty, we can be 75 percent confident. This redefines right and wrong, since degrees of difference are not the same as absolutes.

Many of the Tai Chi exercises can be practised without reference to their martial applications. This aspect of Tai Chi is by far the most popular. 
We can probably make a good guess of the molar mass of exhaled gas, and N is the number of moles of gas involved, so substitute N=mass/molar mass. This leaves gives you PV=mRT/M, which you can rearrange to solve for mass: m=PVM/RT..

Of course! They take pride in restoring old Trabis to their former glory. There is an annual Trabi festival in Zwickau even. In the West or big citys you don see a lot of Trabis because of the air quality rules. They wouldn even get a red sticker!

Because you need to believe in computers nowadays, or they probably go haywire and you need to act out some cheesy sci fi story where you tell them to accomplish a mission by failing the mission for 7 months or something, and that just a funny way to waste a lot of time.I read John K blog, in which he shared really intense opinions about breaking reality and summoning a cartoon character that can defend cartoons, themed around time and colors, and the hulk, that he seemed to have seen in myself, and well. 
Aside from those things, it is a must for every player who engages in gambling poker to know the basic rules in playing the game. Without knowing them may mean gambling more than what you can allow.

Edit: adding to that, think of the psychological effect of being one that gets sexual attention Vs someone that absolutely doesn A girl that gets hit on at least a few times can have some kind of (probably unrealistic) measuring stick as to their own self worth, this usually builds confidence which by itself is typically an increase to your sexual worth guy that gets 0 sexual attention (most guys) will have an inverse effect of lowering his confidence and thus actually plummeting his sexual worth even further.

Gamma ray bursts were way more common (they immediately destroy all developing life on a planet), asteroids meteors flying around, crashing into things, stars going supernova more often as the first stars were larger hotter, and shorter lived, etc. A hypothesis that has been gaining a bit of traction lately is that it only recently that the universe has "calmed down" enough to allow intelligent life to develop and flourish.. 
Spirit Island Solo: I hadn played this game in a while, but have been seeing an influx of posts and comments here over the last few weeks or so, and got an urge to play it again. My wife won play this one with me, as she gets way too discouraged by the unrelenting invaders multiplying over the board each turn. She says even if we it still looks like losing and she doesn want to continue. That is exactly what I love about the game: get hammered by the ravage/build/explore deck, but keep plugging away and eventually you can pull out a win.

This movie is a fairy tale romance of finding coming to terms of your own identity and standing your ground on what you are and what you love. The movie is shot and directed like a classic Hollywood movie filled with a sweeping eye of showing the excessive wealth and the fantasy of living and finding yourself in the high life compared to my mediocre apartment. Sure there are subplots and side characters that don work (setting up a sequel I guess), but it doesn detract much from the main narrative thrust of Rachel finding herself in a different world and ending up with her prince charming, which I understood why Rachel loves him due to Nick charming charisma and his willingness to forgo his "royal" status and family for her. This is a romance that succeeds, because both are willing to sacrifice and change for the sake of the other to protect or be with them, which I find many if not most rom coms lack greatly. I haven seen a rom com with such a loving couple since "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". Hey another movie about cultural differences about couples overcoming to be with one another.
The natural history of a lumbar hernia of the nucleus pulposus (HNP) is not fully known and clear indications for operative intervention cannot be established from the literature. Several studies have shown that the largest discs appear to have the greatest tendency to resolve.

I'm not defending her but, I've heard from several sources that It was "suggested" that Larissa go in like that. I can see TLC doing that. She had just arrived and was new to the fraud that the prices do. She probably thought that's the way the show was done. As for the food, she just flew for over 15 hours and then was literally drained in that hot car. I can't imagine anyone wanting a bowl of hot canned stew. That was probably frauded by tlc, too.

The hubris of Empire is that we truly and really believe that the way we do things is the most evolved way and thus all the world wishes to be like us. Missed the part that while we were living out a John Wayne fantasy of liberating the Russkis from the Commies, the Russian government and people were writing something far more like Dostoevsky "The Brothers Karamazov." the scene where the Grand Inquisitor is speaking with Jesus Christ who has returned to save the people? they talk the Inquisitor   who is Russia   explains to Jesus   who is the US   that it is truly the Inquisitor who cares about the people since what the people really want is an easy set of rules to follow in this life, not some impossible set of standards to ascend into Heaven in the hereafter. Some point, Jesus/the US understands that his righteousness is not really what the masses need and he kisses the Grand Inquisitor to show that he understands the error of his ways..

Tightness in the plantar fascia is good up to a point, since it basically holds your foot together and provides a spring when you walk, jump, or run. But if the fascia is too tight, it may result in arch or heel pain (especially after being off of your feet a while, until walking helps it loosen up again), and may even cause bone spurs over time. 
Some of the issues are even more fundamental, he said, citing the fact that the law does not currently define "accessibility" and leaves people across the province to come up with their own interpretations.

Have you ever watched a televised Poker game? Have you ever sat down and played one? It quite a different experience, isn it? Sometimes, we fold 50 hands before getting a great one. Yet, on TV, it seems that every hand contains an epic battle between a guy with Pocket Queens, Ace King suited, and trip 10s. You see the exciting hands, yet there are countless hands that result in everyone folding and losing money to blinds that are simply edited out.
Sure, they might squeeze, but they also might just flat the 3bet or just fold.

Interesting idea, but we already seen 25 students as seen in that one post organizing students by house: 8 Black Eagles, 9 Blue Lions, and 8 Golden Deer IIRC.

METHODS: An open label randomized prospective controlled 52 week trial matched patients with MS for demographic and disease characteristics, with randomization to treatment or control groups. Treatment patients received escalating vitamin D doses up to 40,000 IU/day over 28 weeks to raise serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] rapidly and assess tolerability, followed by 10,000 IU/day (12 weeks), and further downtitrated to 0 IU/day. Calcium (1,200 mg/day) was given throughout the trial. Primary endpoints were mean change in serum calcium at each vitamin D dose and a comparison of serum calcium between groups. Secondary endpoints included 25(OH)D and other biochemical measures, immunologic biomarkers, relapse events, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score.
"I believe the amount of bugs in this game are directly linked to two causes. The first was the unwillingness of many reviewers, both on Youtube and big sites, to criticize Fallout 4 state at launch.

Seriously just pick one. For bars hit up suttree for high gravity beers, another good microbrewery that is always stellar is downtown grille and brewery. Try to go to the bar upstairs.

The only truly excess money is what left over after you die.

Strip poker is just like any other poker game. The difference in playing strip poker is that players strip items of clothing when they lose a bet. Strip poker has been with us for ages, and contrary to popular belief, strip poker is originally not a sensual, erotic game. Poker developed hundreds of years ago, and strip poker originated from the basic game of poker. Because poker enables one to win while others are losing, the losers then can bet their clothing. This is to take back their cash from the winning opponent. Before, items of clothing are considered of special value.

While all the girls cost 3,000 baht, there were two options. The first option got you 1.5 hours with a in the first fishbowl, full service but no massage. The second option got you two hours, full service plus massage, with a girl from the second fishbowl. The papasan seemed eager to tout the girls in the first fishbowl, but I didn think they were especially better than the girls in the second. He said they were younger, but I didn think they were noticeably so. It came down to a toss up between one from each, so I plumped for the latter option, not only because it more time but also because I do like the massage aspect too.

Its amazing what positive impact daycare has on a child. I use to believe that being a stay at home parent was more benifical but what are they learning? Unless you know the fundamental basic of motor skills and cognitive curriculum learning, a child who is home all the time doesnt generally learn and develop as quickly as those who do. Besides if it helps a child learn and the parent gets independance to work and support themself there should be more of this, more support. I just said in a post above that if a single parent can not afford to send their child to daycare that there should be reduced fee Im pro life for sure, but if you are making positive decisions to better your child(and your) future, then why shouldn we as a society help to support that!

Earlier this month, medical students across the US rallied in support of transgender, intersex, and gender expansive people in response to the Department of Health and Human Services' plans to create a restrictive definition of gender. By conceptualising gender in terms of male and female biological sexes assigned at birth, the administration is threatening the personhood and rights of individuals within these communities. Moreover, it has made daily life increasingly dangerous for a population that is already subject to incredibly high rates of violence.

Sindhi landlord Bijarani is a PPP stalwart accused of presiding over a jirga in 2007 that offered five minor girls as compensation in a murder dispute. The Supreme Court ordered his arrest after a case was brought against him by a women's rights activist. He remained free, Musharraf undertook a little bit of judicial spring cleaning shortly afterwards and according to a story in the international press Bijarani has since claimed to have been acquitted of all charges by a lower court in his own province. This questionable but undoubtedly convenient approach to luxuries like legality might be a great way for the apex court to clear its backlog.

You should find a spot for No.64 ronin raccoon in there somewhere as well, considering you running 3x donpa and 3x recon, which I would exchange one of each for a third seal and helmer personally. Donpa and recon are searchable and you really only need one on the field, are incredibly weak, and don help to cover the deck main weakness  the fact that it hardly generates any advantage but has a boss monster that goes  1 for its effect. Seal and helmer help this, seal actually getting you cards and helmer helping to filter them. Seal should be an auto 3 of imo.

That funny to me because when I was actively learning Chinese (still interested but I lazy) I had a hard time telling exactly where one word ended and the next began, both written and spoken. And it was difficult for me to distinguish between similar sounds; I usually had to see it written in pinyin at lease once or twice before I could be sure of what I was hearing. Especially ch/sh/q/zh/j. J and zh sound basically the same for me but I do try to pronounce them slightly different, same with q and ch. And tones are obviously very difficult for me since I didn grow up speaking a language that uses tones that way. Does it feel weird to you that English doesn use tones the same way?

More and more popularity in online casinos is gained by "sticky" or "phantom" bonuses   the equivalent of lucky chips in real casinos. The amount of bonus is impossible to withdraw, it must remain on the account (as if it "has stuck" to it), until it is completely lost, or annulled on the first withdrawal of cash means (disappears like a phantom). At first sight it may seem that there is little sense in such a casino bonus   you won't get money anyway, but it's not completely true.

My parents divorced when I was 4. So I was old enough to remember them together but too young to know what was going on. TBH it was a good thing that my parents got divorced. They needed to. But my parents hated each other despite that though they always worked out things like vacations even if they were on eachothers weeks. We swapped weeks all the time. It doesnt matter how ugly your divorce was. I promise theirs was worse and even they found a way to make it about their children and not themselves. Grow up.

One thing I took from that book is he said frustration is a wasted emotion, Gallagher added. me, the way that I play, emotion is a big part of my game and you kind of have to channel that the right way. If you get frustrated, it does nobody any good. That kind of been the biggest challenge for me as a player and something I had to learn. I always think back to one of the quotes in that book. It something that he talked about. favourite thing in his home is a painting his parents gave him about three years ago by Canadian artist and family friend Ally McIntyre, who is based in London, England. In the painting, Gallagher is on the ice skating in on Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask. Sitting in the first row behind the net are Gallagher four grandparents. In the row behind them are Canadiens greats Jean B Yvan Cournoyer and Henri Richard, and behind them are Guy Lafleur and Bruins great Bobby Orr, who is wearing a red scarf.

Add to that the fact that Google tracking is so pervasive that even government websites are sending data to Google (often via googleapis) and now it basically impossible for your average person to avoid sending their data to Google. Google also has youtube which has no real competition (Many many youtubers are desperate for a viable alternative) and Andriod whose only meaningful competition is Apple who they share a highly profitable duopoly with. I agree that telecoms need to be broken up but there nothing wrong with going after google..

Anakin doesn hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi Wan could kill Maul in Rebels. This also plays into why the Tusken Raiders fled from Obi Wan in A New Hope; years of conflict with old Ben Kenobi taught them not to attack the Jedi Master, as he held both the low (inverse high) ground and his full mastery of sand [in all its coarseness, roughness, irritability and omnipresence]..

They were entertained at the New York, New York Hotel and Casino where they saw "Zumanity: Another Side of Cirque Du Soleil," which is described as a provocative cabaret style production with a Cirque Du Soleil twist. It is an adult themed 90 minute production with playful innuendo in the intimate "velvet lined" Zumanity Theatre with cabaret stools, love seats or duo sofas that could have been ideal for the sumos. Incidentally, I particularly enjoyed the 90 minutes of sophisticated comedy by Rita Rudner at New York, New York's Cabaret Theatre and could have sat through another hour of her delightful comic litany of laughter as a wife, as a "dog mom" and life in general.

I think you're overestimating how hard it is to avoid using the language of antisemitic tropes, especially since she's repeatedly done it with multiple tropes, and she's actually talked to people knowledgeable about what is a slur (Just reading the anti Semitic canard page on Wikipedia was all she needs to do). I do find it inconsistent how forgiving progressives are about anti Semitic tropes by public figures but are all over sexist or racist tropes.

Pay close attention to small details and use all your senses so you don't miss a sign of a cheating husband. Make sure you keep a log book of descriptions, dates and times of all the clues you discover. If you find a clue, make a copy of it if possible. NEVER accuse him of an affair unless you have concrete proof he was cheating because you may have to use this proof in a court of law should you pursue divorce. If you don't have solid proof, many cheating men lie and make up stories or will call you crazy. Plan your confrontation out in your mind so you will be prepared and armed with facts and evidence. If you have children, make sure they are in a safe, protected place. In addition, don't become a cheating wife to get revenge. It only causes more problems and will be used against you.

Blinds and Antes: Given that the blinds increase as the game proceeds, one must keep in mind that it changes the fraction between what is each round and the average stack size. Therefore, this means that for one to be successful, he or she must be ahead of the blinds. This way it is easier to avoid stack falling away without causing opponents any damage or reaching that final table..

Bonus OffersThe online poker business is highly competitive. As mentioned above, poker rooms make money from players in the form of rakes (the amount of money a card room takes from each pot) and entry fees. The more players a site has, the more revenue it will generate. For this reason, it seems as though every site has bonus offers to attract new players. Practically every site offers a bonus on a player's first deposit ranging from 20 percent (deposit $100 and receive a $20 bonus) up to 100 percent (deposit $100 and get a $100 bonus). These deposit bonuses are usually tied to a requirement to play a predetermined amount of raked hands. Before depositing in any online site, make sure you have read the terms and conditions so you know exactly what you must do to receive the bonus.

I've always found the ways in which the army recruits very amusing yet disturbing. Like, these things are a bit laughable because we're conscious we're being advertised to, but, statistically, some nonzero number of people are being convinced to, like, join the marines because piloting drones is "just like a video game." And that's not even taking into consideration the fact that virtually all depictions of the military in American cinema are glorified paid for army ads, which is perhaps the more insidious problem..

But if it has to, the ruling class will defend its own personal interest with violence. If the majority of people want to overthrow a government, then the police will be expected to stop such a movement, even if it has a huge popular mandate.
For this, just sending an email expressing your interest and asking for a quick meeting should be fine.
