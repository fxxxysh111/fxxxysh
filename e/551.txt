Caribbean Stud Poker is often a simplified sort of Five Card Stud, in which the player competes only up against the dealer. Each player is dealt five cards. All the player's cards are dealt facedown and only one of the dealer's cards is dealt face up. After examining their cards, you can select to increase or fold. If the player raises, they must double their wager ahead of the dealer reveals their hand. Determined by traditional poker rankings, the ball player together with the better hand wins.

Its amazing what positive impact daycare has on a child. I use to believe that being a stay at home parent was more benifical but what are they learning? Unless you know the fundamental basic of motor skills and cognitive curriculum learning, a child who is home all the time doesnt generally learn and develop as quickly as those who do. Besides if it helps a child learn and the parent gets independance to work and support themself there should be more of this, more support. I just said in a post above that if a single parent can not afford to send their child to daycare that there should be reduced fee Im pro life for sure, but if you are making positive decisions to better your child(and your) future, then why shouldn we as a society help to support that!

Wheeling and dealing is not a new art, but it was fully employed in the ancient fragrance trade. The great Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut, for one, knew a business opportunity when she saw one. As one of her greatest accomplishments, she sent an expedition to Punt on the African coast to establish what would be a very profitable trade. She also brought back 31 myrrh trees to Egypt, and they were planted in a botanical garden that lined the walkway leading to her massive temple of Deir al Bahari near Thebes. On the temple walls, the images of the myrrh trees carved in bas relief can still be seen today.
Games like league and Starcraft used to show MMR but moved to ranked divisions because showing a shiny graphic upgrading is more compelling then watching a number rise to your average player.

Any conversion is always on a as needed basis.

If your audience isn familiar with full frame, why convert it?

I honestly belive that while we can win a lot when the opponent is stabbing turn 88 just isnt the spot to do it as draws still have a ton of equity and none of the draws have actually gotten there. 89s KQs KJs are all better bluffing combos that can be in our 3b calling range and have a ton more equity. Now what are our value combos that could play a hand like this? ATs TT 77 maybe 44? And that right there is giving us a good bluff to value ratio for a X/R line on the turn.

I mean, I have no doubt that people will believe the DA and judge would throw away their careers for a former county commissioner son who works at Dari Mart, but that on them. I mean, c what is the deal? Why did it happen quite like this? It looks like somebody was very upset and pulled the trigger on a process which can be stopped, once started, but afterward had something like a change of heart on the matter. Amazingly, the DA and judge (because the judge has to sign off on a plea deal) looked at the case in it totality and still decided that any jail time was too much.
If you check back the flop, that turn bet is always going to be bigger than your flop bet, giving you tough odds to continue since you know jamming offers very little fold equity. Plus you still have V2 to act after you (he would have folded to that flop bet, no?) and no way of narrowing either villain range beyond what you could conclude heading into the flop.

Animal proteins provide a greater array of amino acids than vegetable proteins, and eating them allows you to achieve the threshold dose of protein that is necessary for optimal muscle development. For example, a review of studies that tested various protein doses in conjunction with resistance training on muscle development found that a minimal dose of 2.38 g/kg/day of protein is the amount that reliably produced the most muscle development. That's 178 grams of protein for a 75 kg person an amount that is reasonably achieved if you eat meat and take a whey protein supplement or BCAA capsules post workout..

Got called up to Electronics to talk to a customer while we were starting to close up for the night. I go up there to a very irate customer complaining about earbud headphones. See we had a model of generic $20 30 earbud headphones that were nothing special, but they came in 3 colors: black, grey, and pink. Each color was considered its own item as far as the system was concerned (pretty common for electronics). Now with those color choices, the pink ones weren selling much (or at all), but the black and grey ones were selling fine, so the pink ones were put on clearance for like $5 off to try and get them sold so something else could be put on the shelf.
For example, if there are 300 chips in the pot, and your opponent bets 100 chips, and he is aggressive, your pot odds are 1 in 5, but your implied odds are more like 1 in 9, so you can profitably call with a lot of hands that you would have folded because you have a more accurate representation of the reward of calling.

Urine marking can bring anger to a pet guardian faster than almost any other cat behavior. While you are trying to stop this behavior, keep in mind your cat is doing something that comes very natural to him or her. Your cat is not marking out of spite, anger, or to cause you stress. They spray either to attract the opposite sex (in unneutered/unfixed cats) or to ease their stress when they are feeling anxious or insecure. If you choose to not spay your cat, then there is not much you can do to stop them from marking; it is too much a part of their nature. If your cat is spayed, then you need to keep in mind they are attempting to calm themselves. The smell of their scent makes them feel in control and safe.

Repetitive strain injuries can make it painful to move muscles and joints, which could cost a massage therapist his livelihood if a problem were to become persistent or chronic. The fact that massage therapists work at such close quarters to their clients also means they could be at an increased risk of contracting contagious infections.

That just because a check call flop, check raise turn line seems so nutted that your oppenent could get away from it even with a strong top pair type hand.

In low ranks game 2 my opponent will take all their removal spells out because they know I have no minions in my deck but this is when I side in four copies of thief of sanity.

Once you get to the higher ranks your opponents begin to realize you siding in minions in g2 and begin to answer your threats so you need to come up with a new post sideboard strategy and the cycle begins new. This is just one example but I think it highlights why BO3 is the true way to play the game.

I watched her aunt try to explain that Dad wouldn ever wake up again and I bawled.

There is a chance for us to possibly choose a portion time teaching plan or complete time training system. The subjects like ethics, anatomy, physiology, kinesiology etc might be undertaken in massage therapy instruction applications. In a few programs enterprise management may also be added along with other massage strategies. In normal study course state board will approve these massage therapy programs but in some cases separate acknowledged businesses could approve. By becoming a massage therapist we might be self employed also as generate large amount of money when compared to other employed therapists. On the other hand it really is essential to take a look at for certain needs regarding that specific state prior to undertaking the instruction system.

I think you are aware when you say here but here and SF bay tend to be people who want to min/max their career. I call it elitecode for a reason. Neither the degree or leetcode will hurt your chances of a job but my point was that both accomplish different things. Leetcode will help with the interview process and should be used as interview prep. The degree will increase your fundamental knowledge while leetcode is more about learning to identify patterns. Sure LSAT prep helps you do better but if you don know the fundamentals then trying to memorize problems is not effective. A lot of stuff isn tested during an interview but the OMSCS will look a lot better on your resume and help you get your foot in the door and negotiate higher salaries.

If you asking whether you can cut your second weekly run and only run once a week while training for a marathon, the answer is almost definitely not.

I think this article does a good job of pointing out issues with the metric that is being used to make the claim that poverty is decreasing.

If being pulled out of means anything, it has to be in relation to improving the quality of life of the people with less resources globally.

More likely he acquired his reverse noblesse oblige by training from his father who, according to Trump biographer Harry Hurt III, raised young Donald to become "a killer" and told him "you are king."

Physical Therapist to Massage Therapist Physical therapists who wish to earn secondary licensing as massage therapists must complete at least a certificate program in massage therapy, providing the 500 to 1,000 hours of instruction needed for state licensing. Physical therapists who wish to earn a more advanced credential as board certified massage therapists must have a minimum of 750 hours of education in massage therapy, and 250 hours of hands on clinical experience. They should apply through the certification board's "portfolio review" process, which evaluates the physical therapist's education and verifies that it's comparable to the education required for a board certified massage therapist.

I find this is the problem with the feminist movement more than other social movements.

The first beauty spa may have been the perfume factory owned by Cleopatra at En Gedi, by the Dead Sea.

We know of it only through its mention in Roman texts.

I been sexually assaulted, and what I learned from reading the most reliable research on this issue is that most sexual violence is committed by a small group of repeat offenders. For this group, sexual predation isn about jumping out of the bushes at a stranger; it about exploiting opportunities exactly like the scenario you described. This may be hard to hear or accept, but given that you know he lying about his own level of drinking, I think there a very good chance that he deliberately stayed sober so that he could plan and execute an easily deniable assault on you.

The grammar should also be a concern. Of course Dutch grammar and German grammar have a lot of similarities so that likely would not change very much, but looking at that map you would think it is easier for a Dane than an Icelander to learn German and I am quite certain that isn't the case. Mostly because knowing Icelandic grammar helped me a lot in learning German and dealing with the cases. Of course I can't say for sure what my experience would have been, had my only foreign language been German, since I had already started learning both English and Danish when I started learning German. 5 points  submitted 1 month ago

As the stock market was pressing higher and higher in the summer of 1987, Martin Zweig had a feeling enough was enough.

In October, the market collapsed, and while the big averages lost a quarter of their value in one day, Zweig's portfolio rose 8.7 percent and 50 percent for all of 1987.

It may be rare, to survive through multiple squads with bad loot after a respawn, but that makes it so much better when you pull off a miraculous come from behind victory. Maybe your teammates are having the best round of their life, and all it would take is one more teammate to take a few bullets to the chest to help get the win.

If someone looking for help improving themselves by procrastinating less, by being a better person, etc, I think that falls under the general vision that /u/AgentConundrum had when he created the place five years ago.You giving me way too much credit.

I didn give much (any) thought to "acceptable forms of learning goals".I don have a gut reaction to this submission.

Cette fin d'anne, nous sommes partis (encore !) au Japon. Je crois que dans ce pays fort attentif au rythme des saisons, celles ci sont toutes sources de plaisirs varis. C'est le cas de l'hiver aussi. Certes, les journes sont courtes mais la lumire y est particulirement belle et le temps majoritairement sec. On a fait des balades vivifiantes sous le ciel bleu clatant de Tokyo. On s'est baigns avec merveillement dans des onsen (sources chaudes) entours de magnifiques paysages de neige. C'est en hiver que le contraste est le plus plaisant entre la forte chaleur de ces bains et l'air froid. On a eu de la neige aussi.

The reason this is such an advantage is that the button gets to see what everyone else does before he/she has to act.

The last day I played was the second best live profit I have ever had. I actually stayed longer than I would have normally trying to break that record, but just couldn get enough hands and ran out of steam.

Don worry, I realized the mistake before I ordered my Uber and left and walked back and returned the money.

No question, the ability to move cast iron from the stove top to the oven, as with a braise or frittata, is a huge advantage. Many nonstick skillets today are oven safe as well, though not all of them, especially if they include elements such as a silicone handle that further limit how hot the oven can be. Corn bread, pies and skillet cookies will all sport a deeply colored, crisp crust after baking in cast iron.

Basically if I'd rather go to the WS, I just had to find a way to sell my football ticket and turn it into a plane ticket home and my family would get me the WS ticket.

In blackjack, the usual method for tipping is to place an additional bet at the front of your betting box. Don't tip so much or so frequently that you significantly shift the odds of the game. If you're betting $5 for yourself, a $1 bet for the dealer once or twice an hour, or when you're on a winning streak, will do. If you win the hand, the dealer will get a $2 tip. If you lose, the house gets the money.
