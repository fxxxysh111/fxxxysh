And so we as engineers continually go on replacing pistons. New pistons born every minute. Never you mind the ever failing pistons. Never you mind that the carrying capacity of the engine must perpetually increase, to carry the weight of all the needlessly underperforming, failed and failing pistons that are sabotaged in deference to the greediest of pistons. Never you mind that the ratio of fuel/oil/compression is becoming ever and ever more unequal   there are more and more pistons, but fewer and fewer are getting their needs met. Sure those pistons that are firing best are firing better than ever, but the ratio of pistons failing to pistons successfully generating pressure inside the engine is collapsing   and the building up of dangerous exhaust particulates, of unradiatable excess heat, of flaming wreckage, of flying shrapnel surrounding the engine is becoming so catastrophic that it is threatening the entire ecosystem surrounding it.

Plumber here, I started my apprenticeship at 29, there is a growing and severe lack of skilled labor in this country and once you have the skills and can show that you a good employee companies will fall over each other trying to hire you, all that to say 26 is not too old at all and as a matter of fact my company doesn like taking on apprentices that are just out of high school/ don have much general work experience because they pour a LOT of money and resources into training you and want to see that you a good employee (through work history) before they make that investment. BTW I LOVE what I do and would recommend plumbing to anyone who interested. Plumbing is a much more cerebral trade than people think (I a service plumber vs. new construction) because when you diagnosing a problem you get to play detective "what is the customer saying, what am I seeing, how was this plumbed (often what you trying to diagnose you can directly see)" on the tough diagnosis jobs customers think you have magic powers when you crack it and explain what happened and why and what the fix is.

Another acquaintance of mine, let's call him Abraham, doesn't have two fingers that point in the same direction because they've each been broken by some of his more perceptive and violent marks. I last spoke with him in 2011, just after Christmas. He was in the hospital with broken ribs and a shattered collarbone after one of his cons went wrong.

To end my 4am missive here, we are currently training some amazing new mods. They are going to make mistakes. It's part of the learning process. I remember many mistakes I made back then. I still accidentally stick my foot in it sometimes! When your comments are removed they are not deleted. They are still visible to just yourself and the mods of the sub they came from. If, like I mentioned above you have a carefully thought out comment that has been removed, chances are that there's something in there that if you try modmailing us first, and if that's not going through for you (trust me, I feel your frustration there) if you politely reply to the removal comment asking if there's something you could edit, we'd generally be happy to work with you. Just like you, we'd like the OP's to benefit from as much input as is a available. To the best of our capabilities given what we have to work with, we do try to often follow the spirit of the rule, not the letter in every case.

Mir haben jedoch Ferse und Spitze im Perlmuster nicht gefallen. Glatt gestrickt sah dann die Spitze wie angeklebt aus und auerdem hatte man dann gerade im unteren Zehenbereich, in dem ich leicht Blasen bekomme, eine Naht durch das Aufnehmen der Maschen. Also habe ich mich hingesetzt und berlegt, wie man die Spitze gleich mit anstricken und die Ferse glatt gestrickt gestalten knnte. But I didn like the moss stitch at the heel and the toe. When I knitted it in stockinette stitch, the too looked like stuck on and even worse there was a seam at the beginning of the toe. I very sensitive and get blebs there easily. So I tried to find a way to knit the sock sideways in one piece.

Regular salt (table salt) is iodized, which gives it a different taste. Things like sea salt or kosher salt do not have that same taste and I think actually are much stronger and have a better flavor. My favorite salt is actually Maldon Sea Salt Flakes, but typically when I am baking I just use finely ground sea salt because it is more accessible (flake salt would have to be manually crushed and I am a bit lazy for that).Here a great writeup on the difference between Kosher and Iodized Table Salt.RE: Coffee, coffee is a complimentary flavor to chocolate. 
Homophobia isn't on the rise. That's a ridiculous statement. At least not in the USA. As far as other countries go, then sure, I'll somewhat give you points for that.

Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941)DirectorVictor Fleming StudioMetro Goldwyn Mayer PlotDr Jekyll believes everyone has good and evil sides. He is in love with his fiance Beatrix 'Bea' Emery. When her father Sir Charles takes her away after refusing to allow their early marriage, he plunges himself into his work. He creates a formula aiming to excise his immoral side. This instead transforms him into his evil counterpart who keeps a barmaid named Ivy as an imprisoned mistress, physically and (it is implied) sexually abusing her, until he learns that Beatrix is returning to London. Once again as Jekyll, and filled with remorse, he destroys his work and sends money to Ivy, hoping to make amends for Hyde's behaviour. When MGM made this Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde adaptation they purchased the earlier film's screenplay and destroyed all available copies of this version from the then bankrupt Paramount to prevent unfavourable comparisons. They made some minor tweaks to character names and also toned down the earlier film to make it more in line with the Hays Code, making Ivy a more respectable barmaid, although the theme of Hyde personifying Jekyll's lust and sex drive was retained.

Some types of pain deserve immediate attention from your dentist, however. If you feel a sharp pain when you bite down, for instance, you may have a cavity, a loose filling, a cracked tooth, or damaged pulp (that's the inner core of the tooth that contains the blood vessels and nerves). Pain that sticks around for more than 30 minutes after eating hot or cold foods can also indicate pulp damage, either from a deep cavity or a blow to the tooth.

Point 3. I dont think the warming from Co2 is anywhere near what is being claimed. and natural variation will swamp whatever contribution Co2 does have.

In this case, you'll need to "return" the 2 c4 tiles back to the hand (and keep the hand sorted), and search for next tile that meets the criteria (value == 4). To do that you'll need to make the code "remember" that it had tried c4 so in next iteration it should skip c4 and looks for other tiles with value == 4. The code will be a bit messy, but doable.

One thing I never understood about the VA is that they don universally cover dental care for us.

The adult mammalian brain produces new neurons in the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus throughout life. Many extrinsic and intrinsic (epi)genetic factors can regulate the production of new neurons [48]. Increasing evidence indicates that this process has a role in learning and memory. Ablation of the new cells results in spatial memory deficits [49]. In addition, using markers for immediate early gene expression it has been shown that the new cells are preferentially activated during learning tasks [50]. Furthermore, an increase in neurogenesis is associated with improved cognition. The strongest neurogenic stimulus is exercise. Wheel running in rodents results in a 3 4 fold or even greater increase in the production and survival of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus [30]. The onset of the effect of running on cell genesis is rapid. Cell genesis peaks at three days. After 32 days of running the pro proliferative effect has returned to baseline. Interestingly, the number of immature neurons continues to increase at this time point
