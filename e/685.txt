This news photo service image stamped "Hearst Pathe News Agency" on the back is frm the winter of 1917/1918 and shows a patriotic snow parade somewhere in the United States. The snow looks prodigious, judging from the piles in the foreground and also the accumulated snow on the windowsills, and I imagine that all of the snow floats were sculpted mainly out of exiting snow in the street.

Let me make up another example: I play an esper control deck so in game 1 I have literally no minions. In low ranks game 2 my opponent will take all their removal spells out because they know I have no minions in my deck but this is when I side in four copies of thief of sanity. They took almost all their removal out so the odds of them drawing into an answer t3 is very slim. These are the sorts of mindgames that wins you games and lets you climb in low ranks. Once you get to the higher ranks your opponents begin to realize you siding in minions in g2 and begin to answer your threats so you need to come up with a new post sideboard strategy and the cycle begins new. This is just one example but I think it highlights why BO3 is the true way to play the game.

Then I had a terribly introspective lsd trip and I was struggling to form sentences or find the motivation to get off the couch with the dog and dance with everyone. I realised I kept puffing through my mouth like a twitch as though I was trying to start a tiny fire. Afterwards I thought about it and I could see my "soul energy" or "life force" had dwindled into a tiny flicker and was ready to puff out. I had to fan it with hope and appreciation of nature/beauty/cocoa/life and also build channels for it to keep growing brighter. To build channels keep practicing and get better at life bit by bit and work on something you passionate about or even just value the life experience you collect. These small things build your momentum without being too overwhelming until you feel better than ever. Feed that flame some kindling like you nurture any other creature.

Would minimum wage increases actually help though? I still think they would but it's really wealth inequality that's the issue. If we drive up minimum wage more small businesses begin to fail. The hope is that those people can put more back into the economy but what happens when minimum wages catches up to the wages many college graduates are receiving? Do their wages go up as well or do people stop going to college? Do people re invest or is it now just enough to get by? The increase in the cost of goods should be marginal overall but there are many other possible negative effects.

The Alisal Guest Ranch Resort is located in the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley and renowned Santa Barbara County wine country. Privately owned and operated since 1946, the Alisal is a working cattle ranch and full service resort.

India has also decided it has to open up. I wasn convinced at the beginning. When Manmohan Singh as finance minister and Chidambaram as commerce minister came in the early 1990s just after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pressured them to open up, they asked us if we would back them, lend our credibility to their free market enterprise. We said But when I visited them, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders told me India was selling its heirlooms. I said, would be a U turn But (when the BJP assumed power) and the prime minister visited China, when he came back, the next time I saw him, it was full steam ahead. So they realised that if they didn go this way, they be left behind.

I hate that I can't trust people. I want to trust people and believe in the good in others, but I just feel like I can't nowadays.

For example, in the above example when the opponent made a $20 dollar bet into a pot of $100 optimal theory say fold 6 out of the one time, but if you have been noticing the guy has been bluffing a lot more times than is optimal game theory, then the only way to make money is to call him more than is optimal according to game theory and try to out play your opponent or improve your hand. If you notice a tight player folding more than is optimal, than bluffing more than optimal is going to be the best strategy to make a profit. (Full Answer).

Desmond made history by refusing to give up her seat in the section of the Roseland Theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, on Nov. 8, 1946. On a business trip to Halifax to sell her line of black hair care products, her car broke down. Repairs would take until the next day, so Viola decided to see a movie. She bought a 30 cent ticket. After taking a seat an usher ordered her to the balcony. Returning to the box office, she attempted to pay the 10 cent difference for a main floor seat; she was refused. Suddenly Viola realized the theatre was segregated; black people could only sit in the balcony. Desmond grasped she was being targeted because of her skin tone. Defiantly, she retook her main floor seat. Arrested, the police dragged her from the theatre. Desmond spent 12 terrifying hours sitting up, white gloves on, the image of dignity.

As a bronze plan member, one step up from catastrophic, I'm happy to have monthly premiums under $300, pay our trusted acupuncturist out of pocket, and be part of a co op network with $3 discounts for Film on the Rocks but a 22 percent increase seems a large year over year miscalculation by the CO HealthOP board.

Flop and turn bets are good   could go a little bigger on the turn given that lots of your opponents hands will be pair+gutshot or pair+flush draw and you can size up with your more polarized range (flush draw OR TPTK+) and abuse that. River bet can be on the smaller side but definitely bigger than $50, more like 1/3 1/2 pot. Can be exportability sized bigger as well but I like betting smaller so you can continue to bet your TPTK+.

When players make mistakes because something upsets them emotionally, it is called a "tilt" or "being on a tilt." An example is a player who is a huge favorite in a hand but loses to an opponent who hits a miracle card (often called a "bad beat"). That player becomes so emotionally upset that he/she begins to make bad decisions. Another instance that sometimes puts players on a tilt is when an opponent is loud, obnoxious, rude, or otherwise annoying. Players who are on a tilt react in many different ways with the most common being betting with weaker hands than usual. While it's important to realize when one of your opponents is on a tilt, it is more important to realize when you may be going on a tilt and figuring out how not to let your emotions get the best of you.

At her time, Victoria was the longest reigning sovereign of England. The Impact of Her death was monumental, no pun intended. King Edward , her eldest son, was not coronated King until some time in l902, that will give an idea of the massive impact and (transition time) needed to cope, even in a most conservative Empire.

In the Garden of the Ogre is about sex addiction the way that The Perfect Nanny is about a murderous nursemaid. As with her second novel, she drew from the news for inspiration, but again, what appealed to her about the story is not what you might think. The book is certainly salacious   it concerns a woman whose fixation on sex is obsessive, fanatical   but like The Perfect Nanny, it brazenly resists convention, preferring to be obstinate and aggressive in lieu of likeable. "She was the one who asked for it," Slimani writes of the hero, Adle, the morning after an all night tryst. "She thought she could take it. She is married, a mother, with ambitions, vague but restless, to do more, anything more. Slimani writes of her contempt for work and family, her rock depth apathy, with a candour that must make her real life husband wince. More painful to read of than Adle's masochistic escapades with lovers unknown are the endless mundane days she endures in the company of the unremarkable people who love her, surgeon partner Richard and infant son Lucien.

Sounds like you had a good foundation though man. Not sure how to help beyond that. The second layer to PIO use is really trying to find the spots where the pool is playing vastly different from the sim and using that to simplify your strategy. For instance if you knew BU vs BB that the BB overfolded flop turn and river in the BBB line you can start to change any mixed strategy hand from PIO into a pure strategy bluff knowing youre taking advantage of a spot humans play poorly. I sure I gotten at least $500 in value from my PIO licence but its so hard to learn from I dont touch it nearly as much as I should.

As I learned, in 1956, four men Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel, and James McDermott had published a paper in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, called Optimum Strategy in Blackjack, which was followed in the fall of 1957 by their 92 page monograph, Blackjack to Win: A New Strategy for the Game of 21. But Baldwin et al. had found the Rosetta stone. They had done their original calculations on primitive electro mechanical hand calculators. But Los Alamos had what was probably at that time the most powerful electronic computer in the world the so called MANIAC used primarily to design weapons. It was elementary to program this computer to run blackjack hands by the tens of thousands to verify that the scheme actually worked. I have read some accounts of blackjack history with nary a mention of Los Alamos. I suspect that this activity at the laboratory was not widely known.

While it's understandable that the networks don't want anyone outside TV's transaction triangle to have access to the C3/C7 data, the bloated live 3/live 7 program ratings distributed to the press are wholly irrelevant to advertisers. For example, while network PR touted the 62 percent demo lift the Oct. 3 episode of NBC's "Chicago Fire" earned in playback (the Dick Wolf drama grew from a 1.3 in live same to a 2.1 in live 7), those delayed views didn't have near as much impact on the episode's commercial ratings. Per Nielsen, that particular installment of "Chicago Fire" only inched up to a 1.4 in C7, which amounts to an 8 percent gain. In other words, of the 1 million people in the demo who caught up with the show within seven days of its original airdate, only 129,000 actually watched the ads in playback.

The Boulder District Attorney's Office has also filed two crime of violence sentencing enhancements in the case.Prosecutors allege that Collins struck 71 year old Katie Kulpa in the head with a fire poker at her Lefthand Canyon residence in September, fracturing her skull and nearly killing her.Prosecutors also allege that Collins who had open charges from an unrelated incident at the time of the alleged attack cut off his ankle monitor when he fled and altered his appearance to avoid capture.However, testimony revealed that Collins suffered a chaotic childhood, which resulted in stunted emotional development and left him less mature than the average 16 year old.Collins also reportedly suffers from multiple mental health and substance abuse issues that have been left largely untreated.

In all likelihood, fixed and variable O costs also go up significantly as capacity factor decreases, albeit not linearly. That is because decreasing the load of the nuclear plant or even turning it down to zero does not allow proportional recovery of these costs. There would also be additional actual and opportunity costs associated with ramping and power cycling. In the end I think you would be looking at levelized costs of over $250/MWh under this scenario.

I also tended to forget that I could switch at all; only at the end of the workday would I remember that my desk was moveable.

2) Whether you should have sex with this particular woman. In general, I'd say if you're not excited to do it, don't.

Identification of all the wires extending from the motor should be identified, by either use of an ohm meter, and in some cases, the only way to know is to remove the end housings and physically identify where the external leads are connected on the windings. Because a capacitor is involved it is likely two of the five wires are dedicated wires for the capacitor, leaving two for power, and one as a chassis ground.

It because women body shapes vary more, our clothing varies more, and our clothes are generally worn tighter, so it more complex fitting things properly. Like, I have an average inseam for a woman and a 24 inch waist, but if I grab a pair of 24 jeans to try on, there like a 95% chance they won fit properly. Women have such differences in curviness and weight distribution that there are extra dimensions you have to take into consideration with sizing, so labeling based on one or two measurements would tell you practically nothing about how it would fit..

They come in a variety of styles and colors which small children like and these large cards seem much easier for small hands to grasp while playing cards.

Stretch marks can occur as a result of the skin's physical stretching, but they can also be caused in part by hormones. These long lines can appear on the stomach, chest, arms and thighs. They often begin as red or purple in color and then become glossy, streaked skin [source: WebMD]. There are numerous creams and lotions that can be used during pregnancy to prevent them or after pregnancy to treat them, but while stretch marks usually fade, they rarely disappear completely.

Baby boomers had access to an unimaginable amount of wealth on a scale unseen before, like anywhere. Period. They were a massive generation that had the world at their fingertips.

Bayview Sheppard RMT Marks A Decade For Devoted Massage Therapy
Pain reduction   When an athlete becomes injured they will usually experience a lot of pain. When this pain occurs, messages are sent to the brain through 'afferent nerves'   'sensory nerves that have receptors at the skin and joints'. By massaging the painful area, 'cutaneous mechanoreceptors'   'sensory nerve endings in the skin' are stimulated. This blocks the signals before they reach the spinal cord. Because the brain never receives the pain signals, your perception of pain is reduced.

There are, however, people who through some fault of their own (teenage pregnancy, high school truancy, orphanhood) work two jobs at minimum wage and cannot afford both food and Tylenol.

This is an exploitable character flaw, as a bluff that might require a $100 bet for non degenerates can be reduced to $50, because to the social riff raff known to meddling academics as "the working poor" the difference between $50 and $100 is simply fifty fewer scratch and wins at a predominantly Mexican convenience store..

Imagine playing poker with a group of friends, you may trust your friends outside of the game, but during the game every player assumes that the other players are going to bluff, essentially implying that in a game of poker there is no trust among the players. Poker, like any other game, has defined a set of rules, an objective, and rounds. Furthermore, every player has an equal chance of winning the hand. A keen observer may also note that even though the rules are defined in poker, some players may utilize tricks to gain an advantage over other players.

The year 2015 ended with more illusions. Modi's two minute 'whispering' tete a tete with Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the Climate Change Summit in Paris, his foreign minister Sushma Swaraj coming to Islamabad for the Heart of Asia conference and the decision to resume the long stalled India Pakistan dialogue, his out of the blue telephone call from Kabul to Nawaz Sharif and visit to Lahore on December 25, and then within a week a bizarre terrorist 'hold out' at India's Pathankot airbase, all came together in a curious influx of dreamy illusions in India Pakistan logjam.

Anyways, long story short, this was only the 3rd year of the poker tourney's existence. The 200 11.5g Poker Chip High Roller Set with Clear Cover Aluminum Case was a huge hit and everyone was talking about the new chips.

Rabbit, salmon, ostrich, even alligator. When it comes to what your dog eats, exotic proteins are all the rage. Often, manufacturers market these ingredients as "natural" or less likely to cause an allergic reaction in your furry friend. But, Heinze and her colleagues at Tufts have concluded that protein is protein regardless of where it comes from. "For healthy dogs and cats, there is no benefit of including exotic proteins in pet food. They are not healthier than more traditional meats." they write.

If you are interested in poker table rentals but you have no idea about the type of table that you should select, you should opt for a Texas Hold poker table; this is a safe choice for small, private events, as well as for large tournaments. As far as the style is concerned, you will have to choose between cherry legs or wrought iron poker tables; this is a matter of personal taste and it is entirely up to you to decide what type of poker tables to rent. In order to make a smart choice, you should focus on poker tables that can seat 9 or 10 players, delivered together with poker room quality dealers and high quality A plus poker cards.

In a span of 2 years I went from making $10 an hour working in the field, to making a substantial salary with my own office for the same company. I make more than twice what I made before. Worked hard for it, even risked my life in some scenarios working on steep slope roofs and piecing together Pre Engineered metal buildings in the rain. So don't tell me about laziness and "moving up".

Greater magnesium intake was also linked with a lower plasma glucose and weight circumference and higher high density lipoprotein (HDL). Researchers followed 85,000 women and 42,000 men for 18 and 12 years respectively, during which time 5,400 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Even in those at increased risk for diabetes based on risk factors such as excess weight, increasing age, little physical activity, and smoking, those with the highest levels of dietary magnesium intake reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 34%.3.

To make light for single mothers, If my tax money goes to support you and your baby thats great! We should be standing up for each other when no one else will. If you want to work to support your child then reduced child care should be in your favour. Being a single parent is hard enough with out economical stress.

QJs is an extremely good hand. However, our view on how good QJs is alters based on given scenarios. When a player puts in 20% of their stack in most situations and especially at 1/2, it usually means they have a decent holding. This situation is no different. Therefore the "relative" strength of even our extremely good hands goes way down. QJs fits this description. Even KQo or AJo fits into this description. Same with 77 or JTs. While all of the hands I just listed are good hands, based on the situation, our relative strength just shrinks immensely.

Usually businesses grow because someone can do something better than the competition (or creates something new, that newer existed before, but soon they have competition anyway, so they need to keep their first mover advantage). And usually big companies have efficiency problems, because when you small, you can squeeze some time for a quick call with your main investor, a question regarding some tax problem with your accountant, a meeting with your designer about the new company logo and typeface into your week, but eventually you need to find people that you can trust and delegate to.

Craigslist is probably the most dangerous option for anyone looking to hook up with strangers. These are the sites that we really just want to throw off of a cliff. 
900 Globals Boosts are really good. I have the black/green solid and the bubblegum pearl. Both are have better reaction and roll than the supposed stronger lineup I used last year from Dv8.

Nasty poker game
I worked in the ones that were humans + system all of Fall 2017 spring 2018. 
As a quick review, though, all players are dealt two cards down, and there is a round of betting. Betting actually begins with the blinds, where the two players to the left of the dealer put in bets before the flop before seeing their cards. 
Slot games even fit into a busy working day, taking the boredom out of long commutes..
