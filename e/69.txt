And it also funny, legitimately funny, because people who share her experiences and those who don can both laugh at the interesting way she views and conceptualises the world through humour, whether or not we lived through and thought about what she talking about or not.So to say that experience has no affect on whether a joke is good or not is plainly, obviously false.

This ranch was to welcome 420 people with room for 80 cars which means, I guess, that people were traveling together really together five to a car, which implies that there were a good number of people contributing in an organized way to "aimless" activity.

Why would Dennis not simply initiate the break and accept that Button will retire? Partly because of what Button brings to the team as a driver, but also because of his very high marketing value. The commercial value of his name and image is vastly higher than either of the junior drivers he'd be replaced by. Normally, a talented junior driver can be made marketable very quickly   by success. 
Speedy strip poker games can start like a regular poker game, but everyone (except the winner of course) removes an item of clothing. This is a very fast way and very good excuse for stripping naked, not to mention this will give you great motivation in playing poker. Medium mode stripping in a strip poker game means that the winner is the only person who is not stripping, but the losers have the option to buy back clothes in the coming rounds.

J'avais dj eu le bonheur de goter son pain, on a eu des changes par mail ou tlphone, je l'avais interview mais c'tait la premier fois que je le rencontrais dans la "vie relle". O combien heureuse du voyage ! Quelle belle faon de raconter ses diffrents mtiers. Il est paysan et travaille avec diffrentes varits anciennes de bl qui n'ont pas grand chose  voir avec nos varits actuelles (et permettent beaucoup plus de tolrance au gluten, dit il), sans aucun apport extrieur et dans un environnement absolument non pollu (donc un peu isol). Il est meunier et travaille  la meule de pierre mais d'une faon particulire visiblement douce pour le grain. Il est boulanger et fait un pain qui utilise ses ferments internes. La faon dont il se met au service et accompagne la nature, en intervenant le moins possible, sans ajout extrieur, est impressionnante. Une conception pure et exigente, quasi mystique, du pain  l'oppos total d'une vision industrielle et productiviste visant  simplifier et acclrer la fabrication au maximum. Il veut redonner au pain son rle d'aliment cl, nourrissant, "base de notre pyramide alimentaire". Mais un pain de la qualit du sien, trs riche en nutriments. Nous avons got son pain "de base" et un autre issu d'une varit trs particulire de bl, le "Barbu du Roussillon".

But none of this could stir the good old Sartaj to make an effort to educate parliament on how he wants to play his hand in diplomatic poker. Not that he runs the Foreign Office in an ideal way.

In the early 1980s, Si Redd and his new International Gaming Technology entered into a licensing agreement with Bally's Manufacturing that gave IGT exclusive rights to manufacture video poker machines.

Each of these movements can be done in various positions (supine, tall kneeling, half kneeling, seated, standing, scissor stance) depending on the underlying stability of the individual client.Starting position is dictated by the health professional evaluation of static, dynamic and fundamental stability. The degree of dysfunctional stability (motor control) dictates how challenging the exercise should be in regards to positioning and resistance.Chop and lift patterns for fundamental stability dysfunctions typically begin in an unloaded supine position to lessen demand on the nervous system, thus increasing quality of movement.Static and dynamic stability dysfunctions warrant tall or half kneeling patterns to engage core musculature of the hip.

Good news. Good news. It doesn't happen as often as you would think. While pots do get big, I for one lost an 8k pot in 500 max 2/5 game, they arnt really that out of control. Bad news. The playing style to beat 1/2 is not very similar to 2/5. You're going to need to be able to bluff spots you normally wouldn't and fold hands you normally wouldn't. and while you're learning play a much tighter range than I'm sure you're used to. As you get comfortable starting adding more hands to that range and so on. So to answer your question, gather your thoughts and don't rush to a decision and no one will really notice. Don't make fast reactions like reaching for your chips. Cool calm collected and you'll be fine.

I wonder what kind of world it would be, if we all knew that life was difficult, and that we all shared the same hardship. Instead of looking at each other imagining that other people are happier than we are, and that we "should" be happy ourselves.

Let say you raise and make it 7.00 to go. Everybody else folds except the BB, who calls. There 15.00 in the pot, 3.00 is raked from it, so the rake is 20%. The flop comes, the other player checks to you, and you going to bet. How much should you bet? The standard play here is to bet somewhere around half the pot; perhaps slightly more. If you bet 8.00, and get called, the pot would be 31.00, and the rake would be 16.12%. If you bet 7.00, however, and the villain calls, there is 29.00 in the pot, and the rake is 13.79%. In both cases, let say the Turn card comes out, you bet, and your opponent folds. Over the long run, that roughly 2 1/2% difference in rake between dragging a 29.00 pot, and dragging a 31.00 pot adds up, and most players never even consider it.

I was in high school when that movie came out and I saw it. I hadn't been exposed to mental illness too much by that point in my life and my perception of what the movie was going to be about was more about a genius who ended up dealing with some spy stuff and got in over his head. I believe I also knew that the movie was "based on a true story". As I watched I was fascinated with how smart this man was and the incredible experiences he was having. I really was on his side and thought that there people after him. It didn't click in my head until nearly the end of the movie that he was really suffering was schizophrenic delusions and was not being conspired against by the Soviets. It definitely blew my mind. It read a bit about the guy it was based on afterward and I really felt bad for the guy.

TSM best strategy, as I explained, will 100% gurantee a loss. The best case scenerio for TSM is auto losing in mid/late game. Trying different compositions to raise the chance of winning by 1% from 0% is signficantly better than just giving up and drafting an auto lose team.Another thing that you seem to have trouble understanding is that pick compositions are "not trying to out smart the other team." Pick compositions are precisely for teams with poor macros.

Aging is not a disease, it is a progressive biological change and there may be vast differences in the health of people who are aged 65 and over. One older patient may not be able to tolerate a medical treatment because of accumulated comorbidities, but another of the same age without comorbidities may easily do so. Despite this, I've often come across investigators in medical research who've arbitrarily lumped everyone aged 65 and above in one group, instead of using the same sequential period as younger age groups.

Does anyone have any good resources on overbetting strategy or just a bet sizing in general? I ran a bunch of different pio sims and I still can't figure out exactly when it likes overbetting and when it doesn't. In general there seems to be a correlation between our equity range vs range and likelihood of overbetting but there are a lot of exceptions and I'm just not seeing the pattern fully. With the ranges I assigned in one hand, Pio bet flop overbet turn IP on Th6h2d  offsuit 2 or 3 on the turn but did not overbet on an offsuit A turn when the A is even better for our equity than the 2 or 3. Does it have to do with not having enough high equity bluffs if V turned an A? I'm kind of lost.

Regardless of how you think it should be, the grim fact is that society is not set up to accomodate every variety of defect and enable a fulfilling life.

"I discovered a real personal freedom through it.".It wasn't long before Germanotta's talent for writing hook laden melodies came to the attention of major record labels.

This is the same as the number of permutations of N (52) things taken P (3) at a time, which is stated as N!   P! (52  51  50) If you did not care what order the cards were dealt in, but still wanted to know the probability of getting the Ace, King, and Queen of Spades, then you would be talking about the combinations of N (52) things taken P (3) at a time, which is stated as (N!   P!) / (N   P)! (52  51  50 / 3 / 2 / 1). The probability in this case is 1 in 22,100. (Full Answer).

He didn't want to use realtors. About 6 months earlier, I sat down with a lawyer to form an LLC, pay for a sales contract and a lease agreement. So I had a contract I never used before and I typed up the deal and emailed it to him. A few days later, he signed it and got it back to me. All the while I found a bank that would qualify me for the loan. The VA loan allows for what is called "bonus entitlement" where essentially you can have more than 1 VA loan at a time. There are limitations and BP has some amazing resources on how best to use a VA loan. So I knew I could get qualified and could pay (Kind of important) for the quadplex.

Not to mention all the lighters I find, I have no idea where they came from, as I quite certain I didn buy any of them. Such is the nature of lighters. Gotta put those suckers on a leash.

International lending is an integral part of global trade. Acting like this loan is somehow sketchy is disingenuous.

If you saying that if one has perfect technique, but is overweight and a couch potato, they couldn swim 1500m at a fast pace, I would generally agree, but it probably still depends on the person.

The location has already been described to you accurately, but I will chime in to make sure you are aware that the G spot is not actually universally pleasurable, and even if it is pleasurable most women cannot orgasm from that exclusively. It common for women to go looking for it and think there is something wrong with them or they aren doing it right, when in fact it just not something that works for them. The G spot does not provide any kind of special orgasm that can happen other ways.

By explaining heat in terms of the statistical behavior of atoms and molecules, statistical mechanics made sense of thermodynamics and also provided strong evidence for the reality of atoms. Besides that, statistical mechanics established the role of probabilistic math in the physical sciences. Modern extensions of statistical mechanics (sometimes now called statistical physics) have been applied to everything from materials science and magnets to traffic jams and voting behavior. And even game theory.

Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will say to you, you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to take booty, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder? Oh LORD how perfect is Your ways, who knows the hidden desire of a man heart. The desire of the sinners is always against the will of the LORD.

I think if she commented as part of your post, you could definitely respond, but if it was a passive aggressive separate post to her own page, I would let it alone. Because once you respond, she will go with the angle "It wasn meant for you! It not always about you! Why are you so sennnnnsitiiiiiiiiiivve?" just creating more drama to involve others in. The best thing for passive aggressive posts like that IMO is to ignore and don give them the drama supply they are looking for.

It gets a little confusing as there is Young Dr Lee, and old Dr Lee; there is Dr Wang (pronounced Wong) and there is Professor Huang (pronounced Wang). I guess it's like Smith and Jones back home! Young Dr Lee wouldn't make eye contact with us at first, but now he's becoming used to us and I think he likes us! He is so funny, he comes in and in his broken English, says, "Um, nothing, it's nothing" and then stands there, then says, "okay, is nothing, you okay?" And he keeps nodding and saying mmm mmm, mmm mmm, mmm mmm, and we keep finding ourselves doing the same. So it must look quite hilarious   us all standing there nodding, going mmm mmm, mmm mmm, mmm mmm! Dr Wang loves to smile, he tells Pete he has a massive tumor with a smile on his face. Then he says, "but don't worry, we fix it". Professor Huang, or Smokey Joe as I call him, always has a cigarette in his hand   yes, I'm telling you, they smoke in the hospitals here!! And this is a tumor hospital   unbelievable!!!!

When there is feedback from receiver, it makes the sender to make it understand to the receiver. This will lead to one of effective communication. Feedback is useful for both sender and receiver. The response to feedback is depends on the channel of communication which adopted by the sender. Some time we can have face to face communication. At this time the feedback will be given at same time when message is conveyed. So the receiver need not be waiting for a response to his feedback. But in some cases the response for feedback takes time. For example: in case written communication the response of receiver takes time. Where as in verbal communication will not take much time for feedback.
This issue will literally never be fixed. I haven seen a single game that has fixed it. Any time they start skewing more to an even matching, games take forever to find and the players tart complaining. As soon as they start prioritizing speed, they complain about width in skill gap. These guys are just so much better than anyone else that they only actually have about 300 400 people that they can even match with and get a decent game and those people would all have to be on at the same time for good decent times. If they want good matches, play an inhouse league. CS pros don do matchmaking for a reason.

Here in Canada dental care isn't covered either, although we do have politicians attempting to include it in coverage (which makes sense considering how important it is).

So, that was cool. Learned a thing about my swole eyebrow.

If you really wanna see any more of Stromboli, Koekoek, Perlini, Sikura, and Hayden every night then I wonder if you like watching bad hockey. All 5 of these guys have demonstrated they aren better than 4th line/3rd pairing players. Forsling and Dahlstrom could use some extra time, I can concede that, but neither of them have shown much potential either. The Cat and Strome are 3rd and 5th in minutes among forwards, so they can play much more at this point. I like Delia, but unless Crow is seriously injured, you can bench him; Ward obviously has to stay here.
Pakistan is key to America's salvation in Afghanistan.

When it comes to individualized learning paths, the evidence shows that both gifted students and highly motivated students do really well when they are able to learn at their own pace and have some autonomy over their learning, but unmotivated students (who comprise a significant portion of all high school students) do much worse, as it is essentially removing the extrinsic motivators (like social pressure, group work, clear expectations) which at least had them doing the bare minimum.The takeaway here is that education is really, really complicated, and every time you solve one problem you create another. It doesn help that there are multiple conflicting schools of thought in developmental psychology, behaviour management, educational philosophy, instruction methodology and even organisational design, so a strictly evidence based approach is also impossible.

Your statement mostly appeals to the social impact of age mixed classes, implying that maintaining same age classes helps social development however, social periods (breaks and lunches) are completely varied in ages, particularly in secondary school boasting a huge age leap from 12 to 16 year olds.

The other thing she could be doing is looking for any type of blame that she can accuse you of harboring against her. That is confusing, but my mom has tried that trick too. Apologizing for something, which lulls me into agreeing with her, thereby indirectly finding fault with her or blaming her for something. Which is not how it is at all, but it gives her what she wants: righteous anger at being victimized by her unforgiving daughter. Then she can also complain to others at how unfair I am to her  look at everything she done for me, and now I blame her for this! Etc.

ESH (mildly). You should have (or if your decision is final then should have had) a conversation with her about it. Tell her that you understand she has a lot on her plate just now and that if she can commit to being in a wedding party then you totally understand, but if she still wants to be a bridesmaid then she needs to communicate better about things and make an effort. Then act on her response. She might not realise the effect it had on you, and this is more reasonable than just kicking her out.

But the "angry nerd" stereotype is real and is getting more and more vocal these days, and there a lot of gatekeeping going on as well.
