WHAT would the result of such a stance look like? And WHEN will we learn?WHO: Although the nonbinding resolution in Congress has wide bi partisan support, the real push for an American response is coming from Conservatives. Eric Cantor (R   VA) said"The Administration's silence in the face of Iran's brutal suppression of democratic rights represents a step backwards for homegrown democracy in the Mideast."Joe Lieberman (I  but really an R  CT) scolded"We as Americans have a responsibility to stand in solidarity with people when they are denied their rights by repressive regimes. When elections are stolen, our government should protest. When peaceful demonstrators are beaten and silenced, we have a duty to raise our voices on their behalf. We must tell the Iranian people that we are on their side."Sen. John McCain (R   AZ)"That the United States should make clear that it backs anti Mahmoud Ahmadinejad demonstrators in their battle against 'an oppressive, repressive regime.'"WHY: Call me skeptical, but why would the very same Republicans who so thoroughly mishandled an election here in 2000, be so outraged by the mishandling of the election in Iran? To take a longer historical view, why would the very same conservative movement that overthrew "homegrown democracy" in the Middle East when the CIA and Britian M16 illegally and forcibly installing the Shah in in 1953, possibly give a fig about democracy in Iran?.

One day she brought in a lovely lab who at first I thought was an oldie, since the lady took in a lot of oldies. To my horror I learned that this "old girl" was only four years old, yet looked like she was 12+. It turned out that she was left for dead by the BYB because she had been bred so many times that she had permanent damage to her reproductive organs and had to undergo several surgeries to save her.

Yea, the cause and time of day of accidents aren statistically very much different from any other State either. I also imagine it because Texas has several ports of entry/exit to Mexico, and because it centrally located within the south of the country it makes it a good location to cross during long North South or East West journeys. The much lower average population density compared to California probably plays an important part, in that, it probably going to take longer for Highway Patrol and/or Lifeflight services to arrive on your scene..

This is just me speculating. Both Benny and Bjorn at various times seem to agree or acknowledge that ABBA music is corny and trite, they surprised at its longevity, and the ardor of their fans, new and old. Bjorn stated that they had no access to drugs, but I don really believe that they didn If they really wanted access to drugs, they could have gotten it. Hard drugs like cocaine and heroin might not have been everywhere in Stockholm, but it was probably possible get hands on it if was a priority. I doubt anyone in ABBA made it one. Same with mushrooms or LSD. Maybe he couched it in these terms to sound cooler, or less wholesome, as to many people wholesome sounds corny.

Susan Kaye, a therapist working in Philadelphia and Austin, Texas, works with surrogates "below the horizon" for a practical reason   she can't even find certified surrogates in her areas. "I have gotten around it by working with people who are 'body workers,' people I have trained on what I want them to do with clients." "Body work," as Kaye defines it, excludes intercourse, but can include genital touching and genital massage.

You are limited to such a speed by the cars in front of you such that cars behind you catch up. By your logic, a line of cars coming behind, and then having to slow down, will all instantly move over (because they are now holding up the traffic behind them) such that the back car passes everyone (he's the only one now not holding up traffic). 
Funk is a wrestling style. Prior to Askren's dominance, high level matches were very often low scoring affairs where wrestlers would often stall each other out after maybe a set up, a shot, and then a quick attempt to counter wrestle before stalemates and restarts.

That article you referenced, Republicans were wildly successful at suppressing voters in 2016 is sensationalist, inflamatory, and so obviously a "poor loser" attempt by the losing party, it made me laugh.

My father has always been a conservative who leans a bit more libertarian and is even slightly socially liberal, yet has always been active in local politics including being the county Republican Party chairman for a while. He was a firm believer in the whole "lesser than of two evils" and that a vote towards a third party candidate is a wasted vote even if he likes them and agrees with them more and has been something we clash on a lot. Last year he became a registered independent because "this Republican Party, is not the party I support or signed up to be a part of" he's very much a Reagan Republican (which is still a can of worms) and I truly have never respected my father more for taking a stand in what little way he can because of integrity. I wish the party had a spine. It's now clearly Trumps party.

The RRSP savings would generate tax savings.

You can actually use your corner analogy to understand what is going on. Let say that you have a corner whose angle you can adjust. What is the smallest angle that it can be at and the semicircle still fit in the corner? To do this, imagine that we are on the coordinate grid, and the left edge of the semi circle is snug up against the y axis. We can then use the line y=mx, of varying slope m, to investigate this. The question is then "Where does the line y=mx intersect this circle?" You can see the situation here.

It a relatively simple improvement to a necessary and laborious job adding the spreader made the application of manure far easier than have it slide through a jamable sluice in the bottom of a wagon, and certainly a lot easier and more thorough than spreading it by hand. regional (southern) manyo).

Preeclampsia   Preeclampsia, also called pregnancy induced hypertension or PIH, is persistent high blood pressure with protein in the urine that develops after 20 weeks of gestation and returns to normal levels after childbirth. The most common sign is widespread edema. If left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to damaged retinal and/or renal blood vessels, as well as compromised fetal blood flow, liver abnormalities, and bleeding disorders. Preeclampsia occurs in 5% to 8% of all pregnancies. This condition is more common in first pregnancies, many prior pregnancies, and young or advanced maternal age. It is also more common in women who are pregnant with multiple babies. Eclampsia is a severe form of preeclampsia that involves convulsions or seizures.

But, during those five hours, you may at some point have been down to $1,000 and at another point been up to $20,000.

According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently "humanized" and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. For example, attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.[165] In contrast to social democracy, democratic socialists advocate a post capitalist economic system based on either market socialism combined with workers self management or on some form of participatory economic planning.[166] 1 point  submitted 9 hours agoYeah just stay on the outside of the line.

A close enough approximation to figure out the odds of getting the hand you want is to multiply the number of cards left in the deck that can complete your hand  4 if there are still 2 cards to be drawn, and  2 if there is only one card to be drawn. So, for example, if between the flop and your hand, you have 4 hearts, there are still 9 more hearts in the deck that can give you your flush   which gives you (roughly) 36% chance. If the next card on the table is a spade, you have an 18% chance of getting your flush..
