Durability: Exercise balls can vary widely and most companies will put the weight limit of the ball on the package. Weight limits can range from 250 to over 1000 pounds. If you are using the ball just for bodyweight exercises and are under 250 pounds, just about any ball should suffice. Higher durability exercise balls are recommended for people lifting heavy weights on the ball. Lower durability balls are generally thinner and create more of a challenge in terms of balance.

EDIT: I would love to hear some counterpoints from the downvoters. To be clear, I am standing by my original claim that it is possible for a poker player to conceivably identify and take a GTO line in the majority of spots; and I concede the point that playing GTO 100% of the time is impossible because completely solving the game (and therefore truly playing GTO) is impossible. But through intense study of enough decision trees the approximations of GTO lines are close enough to enable a player to reach this level of play..

It makes sense that Verhoeven's audacious sensibility would appeal to Huppert, whose portrayal of the sadomasochistic Erika Kohut (partial to genital slicing and Mom humping) in Haneke's The Piano Teacher endures as one of her most indelible performances from the past fifteen years.

Ashely Peifer,Betsy Ruth ByersThis joint exhibition at Rosalux juxtaposes Ashely Peifer's playful textiles and works on paper with Betsy Ruth Byers' gorgeous abstract paintings of disappearing glaciers. Where Peifer's work has a flat, childlike sense of the primitive, Byers' abstractions are resonant with mood, alive with depth, and vivid with the intensity of the moment. Both artists capture a sense of the fleeting and render it concrete.

If Kim was actively an alcoholic, I could see the argument that she wasn't in the right frame of mind to make such a decision. But I also think she might have just regretted it and since she is incapable of admitting she made a mistake or did something wrong, can't just admit to herself that she shouldn't have sold her share, but did, and regretted it. Kim has a pretty loose relationship with the truth, especially when she's mad or caught in the act (like when she wasn't sober at Eileen's poker night and said her ex gave her one of his pain pills   and before he died, he went on record to say he didn't)..

He comes right back in the other side.

You know, over the years when this has popped to mind I thought about why I didn call the police. And I would like to believe that it because I didn know where the nearest police station was and I didn want him to feel threatened and get angry. The truth is a lot worse though: I didn want to look like a bitch/a stupid little girl over reacting. My parents were already worried about me doing this drive alone and I guess I wanted to prove that I wasn a little kid anymore who screams when someone says "boo". It was pure 19 year old stupidity. If this has happened now, when I less afraid of how people will judge me and when I finally realized my own safety is more important than seeming rude, I sure this would have played out differently. A lot of girls get hurt because they don want to appear rude. That been a major tactic of kidnapped and killers forever, luring women in by asking for help and making them feel bad for saying no. And I want to be kind, and I want to help people, but because of a tiny number of assholes I now have to say no for my own safety. Because even though 90% of the time they won attack me, that 10% still exists. And that sucks.

Assuming I feel fine (which I do) and I am getting necessary nutrition, is there a calorie deficit where my body stops doing what I want it to do (namely, burn fat)? I didn even think of it until I saw my Fitbit say I was "under" instead of "In the zone"..

I wish more people would see things in this way. Our current economic system prioritizes and rewards profiteering above all else. There is no incentive to conduct business ethically outside of what the "fringe millennial hipsters" say. Many times, ethical business practices are too expensive to entertain.

Remember, you competing with the real world, the real world that cuts costs in labor and cuts cost in ethical material resourcing and cuts cost in responsible environmental practices. Someone with a questionable conscience could do exactly what you do, but for a much lower price; so people vote with their wallets.

The brewery, restaurant, and cafe will open to the public on Wednesday, March 20, in the burgeoning West End neighborhood as Night Shift's most creative project to date.

"When we started, one of our phrases was 'culinary inspired beers,' which is part of our DNA. On the opening beer list, patrons will find the Fixed Wing, an ale with sweet cherries, butterfly pea flower, lemon, and lemongrass; and the Living Dead, which uses molasses, pineapple, pink guava, lime, and cinnamon. The 30 tap lines at Lovejoy will include a selection of Night Shift staples   Nite Lite, Whirlpool, Santilli, and The 87  and Lovejoy exclusives, including the Lovejoy house IPA, a recipe that emerged after the brewery presented four versions to the public last year and gave them the opportunity to vote for a favorite. (Lovejoy 4 emerged victorious.)

Little confused. You said it was the BB who 3 bet you pre and you were UTG. Didn he check before you on the flop? As far as leading on this flop as played. I don mind that sometimes at all.

So your range when you lead is exactly what you have or AQ, maybe AJ suited. Would not want to do this all the time but in this spot I think it is a good option. You can always bet/fold if someone shows more strength on that flop if you had the right read.

Surely 7 hours at school socialising with the same age vs 9 hours at home socialising with +/  ages would kind of make this statement redundant? Your statement mostly appeals to the social impact of age mixed classes, implying that maintaining same age classes helps social development however, social periods (breaks and lunches) are completely varied in ages, particularly in secondary school boasting a huge age leap from 12 to 16 year olds. 
My understanding is that another problem with hadiths are that Muslims have no agreed upon leader.

Predicting how a person will respond can be very useful, for instance when designing a strategy for negotiations.We investigate whether it is possible for machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize a person TMs intentions and predict their actions based on their visually expressive behaviour, where in this paper we focus on the face. We have chosen as our setting pairs of humans playing a simplified version of poker, where the players are behaving naturally and spontaneously, albeit mediated through a computer connection.In particular, we ask if we can automatically predict whether a player is going to fold or not. We also try to answer the question of at what time point the signal for predicting if a player will fold is strongest.

Apparently the notion that Egyptians used slaves was touted by the ancient Greeks. "The Greek historian Herodotus tells us that the Great Pyramid was built by 100,000 slaves who constantly and were relieved every three months by a fresh gang He is, however, wrong. King Khufu   4th Dynasty ruler of Egypt   the royal responsible for the commissioning of the Great Pyramid, did not have a vast body of slaves at his disposal, and even if he had, there was no way that 100,000 could work simultaneously on one pyramid."
Tightness in the plantar fascia is good up to a point, since it basically holds your foot together and provides a spring when you walk, jump, or run. But if the fascia is too tight, it may result in arch or heel pain (especially after being off of your feet a while, until walking helps it loosen up again), and may even cause bone spurs over time. There are a couple things you can do that may alleviate pain from tight plantar fascia..

The ad game for the new Disney series "Pair of Kings" appeared on Poptropica beginning on September 9, 2010. The game posits that Boomer and Brady have been taken into a cave maze by the Tarantula People, and they have to be found and rescued. Getting hit 4 times means that you must restart the game. The path is up and right, using the elevator rocks, then across to the left. When you encounter a tall rock, drop through the hole to the lower level and continue left. Climb the vines, jump right, and jump past the warriors and Mummy to reach Boomer and Brady at the upper right. You receive a Pair of Kings costume set, and a Volcano God effects card. The effect causes a harmless shaking of the ground and a few showers of aerial lava rocks. A poker hand consist out of 5 cards. The highest card(s) win of course the hand. In this case I'm going to give you an example. Since there is no 5'th card I'll use X for it. In this case the highest pair (or valid combination of more then 2 cards) is the Aces. The pair of Kings Queens looks like KKQQX. As you can see here, the highest pair (or valid combination of more then 2 cards) are the Kings. Because the Aces are of course higher then the Kings, the hand AA22X (or Aces and Deuces) win the hand. (Full Answer)

Criminal and civil charges filed in New York have forced online poker sites PokerStars (based in the Isle of Man) and Full Tilt Poker (based in Alderney, in the Channel Islands), as well as Canada based Absolute Poker, to stop doing business with Americans.It is the latest upheaval for the industry, which over the last decade has grown from nothing into one that rakes in an estimated $5bn (3.25bn) each year and is regulated in vastly different ways in countries around the world.America is the biggest market, with up to a million online players.
