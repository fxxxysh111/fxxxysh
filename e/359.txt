We have rules in place to limit spam, one of which is if a post receives two reports it removed and a message is sent to moderators. This has never been an issue before and has removed spam from the subreddit. I going to change the settings so you will also get a comment explaining that it was removed, and that it will be manually checked and either reinstated or a reason for its removal given. I going to review your post now.

Credit to Canadian businesses rose in the last 12 months through January by 6.1 per cent to $2.18 trillion, while lending to households expanded 3.1 per cent and reached $2.16 trillion, according to Bank of Canada data. Lenders are expanding credit to companies even as the country economic growth almost stalled in the last quarter of 2018 as consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing investment fell by the most in a decade, business spending dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.. 
I just want to know if they owe too much for me to be able to buy the house. I don't want to waste my time going to meet with them if there is no way I would be able to buy the house for what I would need to buy it for.

Living in a post gender world that is simultaneously patriarchal may seem impossible, an oxymoron written on the body and lives of academic sorts like me. But I think post gender might be the correct response to patriarchy  an absolute refusal to locate ourselves on either side of the gender binary so that humans with any sort of body parts and any gender expression can join together to say that bodies  of whatever gender  deserve protection from state interference in the form of forced pregnancy, hate speech in the form of blaming "women," and violence.

We have to remember that "popular" is all relative. In the age of the internet every opinion and viewpoint is "popular," because everyone who holds it can jump onto Twitter and mouth off about it. The online reaction to said opinion is appropriately outsized, which makes people think that the issue is even larger than it really is (reading Reddit, you might think that Flat Earthers are legion, when they are obviously not). But the truth is that SJW esque viewpoints are definitionally fringe. They espoused by radicals to bring attention to an issue. Acting as though they mainstream or a real threat to the status quo is tilting at windmills.

People are going to try and convince you that your "motivation" is important. This is bullshit. What most people consider "motivation" is controlled by context and your emotional state. None of those things can be relied on in the long term. Your desire to improve your Russian is all the motivation that you need. Construct your habits so that you accomplish things that improve your skills. Don focus on the ultimate goal of "being fluent". If you focus your effort on doing the right kind of work and protecting your study time, you will make progress. Are you a Russian speaker or a FaceBook/Reddit addict? Your actions determine your answer to that question. What are the things a Russian speaker would do? Do those things. In just a few months your identity will become bound up in your systems/habits. And it will be harder for you to skip your learning sessions and easier to do the things that will are going to help you progress. You can worry about motivation and emotional factors once you have established study habits that work for you. 5 points  submitted 12 days ago
1: The fence is part of a university research project, a joint study to do studies of soil quality in the area (not uncommon in areas that are near geothermal places like Yellowstone), and a project to track some regional elk.

You can even correlate the number on its tracker with some of the information you can take out of the research site with you, if you keep it before the site burns..

The Italian game called "Primero" was the first card game that was directly related to today's modern game of poker. Primero dated back to the early 1500s and is sometimes called "pokers mother". This game provided each player with 3 to 4 cards, card values, and the ability to bet and bluff to complete each hand. The French game "Porque" and the German game "Pochen" where both created from Primero modifications. Primero was brought to Canada by French Canadian settlers and was brought down through the Mississippi River to what is now the United States of America. This is around the time in which Primero was given the name and classification as the "Cheating Game". Over time the games have been adjusted again and again which has developed the great game of poker.

So it's less like having eyes in the back of your head and more like having a pair of those novelty sunglasses with mirrors that let you see behind you.

Needless to say, this is wrong. Physics is sufficiently far developed to state that there will never be a way to make a proton or a neutron or any other nucleus simply disappear and convert its entire mass into energy. It is true that there are processes by which various smaller particles positive and negative electrons and mesons are annihilated, but all these phenomena involve at least one particle which does not normally occur in nature and therefore must first be created, and this creation process consumes as much energy as is afterwards liberated.

You can easily ride them out 700 miles, but there is something to be said for opening up that new box of shoes after a few weeks of hiking on worn out shoes.

People dont like to talk about the fact that amogst all trans people, pre and post transition, or pre and post op, the suicide rate stays at a clean 40%, which tells me that transitioning solves absolutely nothing.

The current 52 card deck is often credited to European countries. In the fifteenth century, France introduced the current suits of clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades in a game called Poque. It is quite possible that the word "poker" is derived from that word. Others, however, claim that the word "poker" comes from the German card game pochspiel or the German bluffing game pochen, which dates back to the sixteenth century. Also, the British are credited with the introduction of games called "Brag" and "Faro," which were played in many saloons in the Old West.

$16.99  89/100What does one say about the 2016 vintage in Germany? Balance, balance, balance perhaps best expressed by well known US commentator and importer Thierry Theise, who says the vintage is a fruit driven, nor floral driven, nor mineral driven, nor acid driven vintage it is all of these. In the case of this friendly Selbach blend of Mosel sites, there is touch less electricity or bright acidity in 2016 but there is more weight and flavour. It still juicy with ripe nectarine flavours and drizzle of lemon making it eminently enjoyable right now. Oh, and you can pair it with anything.
The interior design of the hotel, as shown in artist renderings, depicts a modern and trendy vibe in the restaurants and lobby areas, with a soft and somewhat romantic twist in other sections of the hotel. Located on the 102nd floor is an Italian Restaurant with an open kitchen design, the Lobby Lounge serving signature afternoon tea and a Chinese Restaurant with 7 private rooms. On the 103rd floor, a tea lounge for guests and on the 118th floor, a rooftop restaurant and bar, undoubtedly providing the world most magnificent views, and also testing the vertigo of its guests.

Part of what sets this movie a notch below the others is just how redundant the plot feels. There's not much of a new storyline here beyond the El Dorado quest which ends up being something of an afterthought anyway. The villain is one dimensional, and in terms of scale, it feels a bit like The Hidden World might have fit better as the middle chapter rather than the finale.

Written a few times in this blog about what I think isfound/unintentional antiquarian Dadaist art, as in Floating Eyes and Ears, 1650, (and also (here, here and here) and would like to continue that thread with this found bit of 1930 Costumery.]The Beaux Arts Ball, Halloween 1931, featured a dozen or so of some of the principal architects in NYC dressed as their most esteemed structures. The end result in this uncomfortable assembly is delightfully absurd the outfits could have easily been found on stage in Berlin in 1923 than as this salute to privilege. (For example see my post from last week on Oskar Schlemmer.)For the record, we see:A. Stewart Walker, dressed (and almost completely engulfed) as his Fuller Building at 57th Street (and not the Fuller building which is today known as as the Flat Iron Building);Leonard Schultze as the Waldorf Astoria;Ely Jacques as the Squibb Building (so delightfully nestled in there with the Plaza and Savoy Plaza);William Van Alen as the Chrysler Building (which, three years now after its groundbreaking, was still the tallest building in the world, though it would be eclipsed within months by the completed Empire State Building. The New York Times Building is the exact height of the Chrysler Building, though this bleak structure in no other way can compare to Alen masterpiece.)
There are some huge silver maple trees with surface roots that are causing nightmares. I have to imagine not only is the pool partially to blame for those exposed roots, but the roots would have had to do some significant damage to whatever is left of the pool.

Nowhere is the angst over the future of SNC Lavalin more intense than in its home province of Quebec. In recent days, Quebec Premier Francois Legault has weighed in, warning that the company could be susceptible to a takeover or significant job attrition given its weakened state.

Whenever (or however) you lose weight or size, the number of fat cells you have will remain the same   it is the volume of the cells that changes. Liposlim activates lipolysis, making your fat cells appear smaller. It does this by breaking up the lipids inside the fat cells into thousands of tiny droplets which gradually dissolve and visibly shrink the volume of fat in each cell. With the help of microcirculation boosters included in the formula, the melted fat volume from inside the cells is then transported away and out of the body.

IIRC the averages on these were pretty high.There were also weekly homework assignments with mainly MC questions through Top Hat, and in class Top Hat activities.

Troy Keeping, Southland's president and general manager, says Southland is bucking a national trend, describing its track as a "very viable, profitable racing business." But some track owners like Caesars Entertainment, which operates the Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in Council Bluffs, Iowa want to get out of the dog business.

Ultimately, I agree with your goals: we need to abandon for profit healthcare, move away from private insurers to a single payer system, and address lobbyists and money in politics. However, I do not agree with your assessment that both sides are equally responsible and equally incapable of effecting the change we both support. Premiums rise for a variety of reasons, but the ACA was designed to curb premium costs through Medicaid expansion (to allow the government to cover the highest risk patients based on poverty, not age and disability), subsidies (both to patients and to insurers), and by offering a competing market option through the federal healthcare marketplace. The funding for the subsidies and Medicaid expansion would mostly come from additional taxes on the wealthy and a variety of surcharges and excise taxes on a variety of goods and services.

These drugs are usually prescribed to be taken every time a person feels intolerable pain.

I would consider his winning range K9+, 66, 77, 44, JJ and he losing with 88, 99, A4 that he thinks is value. Very few bluffs left. I guess, I fold.
Another guard turned a corner, walking straight toward him, completely unfazed. Well, for now.Dropping his shoulder, he slammed into the exit handled, labeled in red with "EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY", completely disregarding the blaring alarm. 
[It pretty obvious that Neelix is reverse bluffing here, and he might be overdoing it. Since he obviously does know the rules and strategy my guess is that he really was unfamiliar with the game but they been playing for a little while now, and he read the rules. Neelix knew some pretty tough weirdos and probably got into a few scrapes. Even if he not a gambler, it reasonable that he been around gambling and can pick up on strategy quickly, especially since so much of it is seemingly a "mind game."]

Look, I get it. It isn't for everyone, but itistelling that most negative reviews of the movie were written by men. Is it my favorite MCU movie? No, that still goes toCaptain America: Civil War, but the film does a great job of introducing us to Carol Danvers and setting up her storyline..

Late Position   The 7th, 8th and 9th seats at the table to the left of the dealer make up the late position. Here you are in an excellent seating area of the table. You can gather a great amount of information about the players and their hands. In these positions, one should be aggressive if not many have entered the pot. If there are a lot of players, scale back the aggressive play unless you have the type of superior hand as discussed in the early position. Another advantage of the late position is that you can easily play cards like 5 8, J 7, Q 8. For example, supposing you have 5 8 in the late position and the flop is 2 6 7 unsuited and everyone else checks. Raising at a non aggressive table would be the correct thing to do as it gives you a chance to gain control of the pot as well as keeping other raises in check from those who would try to steal the pot. But remember, it is not a license to play trash hands.
I half thought everyone was joking with me until the dealer dealt me aces the next hand and then told me I was required to fold the hand.

If you work for someone else and they aren paying you enough, tell them. If they don offer you the raise you NEED, then leave. If you still don quit, then you proved they were in fact paying you enough money. Employers don decide their employees wages based on feelings, they base it on the going market rate. If you unhappy with your market value, then do something to change that, don complain that the government should step in and spend money they don have in order to get you into a nicer apartment. 1 point  submitted 1 year ago

Consider picking one of the least harmless, topical, natural home treatment remedies (the kind you whip up at home), and try it on your scalp for at least 30 days and see what happens.

At the beginning of the manga I can honestly say that it was a bit confusing as it lacked a very small explanation to get it through my head, though it was only for the very first pages and not like those manga that tend to not explain nothing at all in certain cases until a few chapters later. I appreciated that and it made it feel a bit more lively as it explained after a few more pages. A reason to do this is because of the focus of the main protagonist. For that reason it being why it started like it did and without much of exploration on the explaining. What I also seemed to find pretty gratifying was the introductions and interactions of the characters. They seemed wholesome yet when the time came for seriousness it came down totally to it and it felt really spectacular. The conversations they would have with each other was enjoyable and entertaining when they were joking around, the smart talk they did blew my mind when they solved mysteries.

After thelred's death, and after nearly 36 years of raiding, England was severely weakened. However, there is evidence that suggests that England could have been a lot stronger. Edmund Ironsides, thelred's son, openly fought the Viking forces of Cnut effectively for the first time. The result at the battle of Ashingdon was a victory for Cnut against Edmund Ironsides, yet Edmund Ironsides maintained the freedom of the Kingdom of Wessex for the period of his reign, even though it proved to be only for just one year. Despite the defeat at Ashingdon, Edmund's actions showed that England was capable of raising an army against Viking invaders.

7 Card Stud is played both high only (meaning the highest hand wins) and high low/hi lo (meaning that the highest hand splits the winnings with the lowest hand). The discussion in this article will center on the high only version. 7 Card Stud is also played at both set limit and pot (the pot is the total amount that has been bet in a single game) limit. Set limit means that there's a preset limit to how much you can bet, and pot limit means that you can bet as much money as there is in the pot at any given time.

Now, many researchers believe that female ejaculate is produced by the Skene glands, which are located near a woman urethra and are made of tissue that similar in composition to a man prostate gland.

This would seem to indicate that a woman ejaculation is similar in composition to semen   without the sperm, of course.

I understand looking in the mirror and seeing someone different everytime. Even now, I feel like Alice in Wonderland, constantly changing size and shape, every sip of water showing to the world. But really, it not like that. No one sees the things I do because they aren actually real. There are treatments that will help and even though I still see things wrong or just feel like my body is wrong, through treatment I was able to find the tools to work through those feelings when they occur. So can you. And it so much easier to learn better coping mechanisms when you haven been ingrained in harmful thought patterns for years.
After thought edit: Like some of the other posters have said, try communicating with the male staff when you have to work with them. From the overall feelings to specific aspects of the treatment that could be made more comfortable (within reason).
