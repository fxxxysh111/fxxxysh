If the showrunner is hellbent on making the cast diverse for the sake of diversity (the aforementioned "political bias"), then the casting process adds unnecessary steps: Character described as white by source material  > Showrunner wants diversity  > Open a casting call for white actors and non white actors alike  > Cast best actor out of this "more diverse" bunch  > Try to explain away the importance of ethnicity  > Call fans racists or bigots. It obviously not about faithfulness to the source material. It isn even about "finding the best actor." Their values are applied selectively so long as it supports their biases.

To be cautious and conservative, 1) you must dose volumetrically and 2) you must start at a very low dosage and increment it upwards slowly in very small steps, stopping at a "sweet spot". For me the "sweet spot" is just a tiny bit above "I could easily forget it was a microdose day." A sense of euphoria, or the thought "Is my microdose showing?" means the dosage is too high. (For LSD, I think a good starting point is 2ug, increasing by units of 1ug until the sweet spot is reached. Everyone is different, but to me it seems that going above about 8ug is kind of an excuse for getting high.)

So now I make it a point to protect my friends as well who haven developed those instincts yet.

It a tension broken only when Wendy and her friends are together. There is a deep feeling of community and friendship from these girls; they are each other safety net. While they have disagreements and keep secrets from each other, they share a mutual understanding that makes them closer than family. And this is what the book is about more than anything else: a group of friends who find each other and become family when their own families are unsupportive to various degrees. This community is a huge part of the reason Wendy thinks things have gotten better for trans people, and it why she is at first surprised, then angry, that her friend would kill herself they had support that didn exist when she first transitioned. She speaks several times with Anna, a friend who knew her Opa secret. Anna describes Wendy grandfather as her, but may mean he was gay, as Anna lacks the terminology to discuss it. He lived in a culture so deeply against such things that speaking about it directly is barely an option. She shows that Wendy grandfather version of happiness was very different from Wendy own, and perhaps there is room for both to exist, no matter how foreign they are to each other.

They not going to spend years and years filling out multiple massive world spaces, they probably not going to use procedural generation (that kind of the antithesis of Beth modus operandi), and it unlikely that they make a bunch of exceedingly barren main areas. So, we can assume that we going to get multiple smaller areas or one big area as usual. It very possible that there won be multiple planets at all, despite what most people seem to be expecting (including myself).

In the early 1970s, researchers were studying how the brain is affected by opiates, such as heroin or morphine. They found that opiates interact with specialized receptors in cells that are primarily massed in the brain and spinal cord. When opiates enter these receptors, they hinder or block the cell's transmission of pain signals. But why, wondered the scientists studying this phenomenon, would these specialized receptors exist in the first place? The most plausible answer was that opioid receptors exist due to the presence of an opiatelike substance produced naturally in the body.

Trustworthiness of a real game flow somehow affects the gaming community as well. The feeling is different when you're able to see the croupier actually at the table doing all the things he/she needs to do compared to witnessing the actions made by a piece of software you can't communicate to in any way or even consider an entity.

Scoop Review of Books Bugs for Kids
Bodies of water seem to have held some spiritual significance, probably being seen as liminal spaces between the physical world and supernatural otherworld. We can assume this based on votive offerings left in lakes, ponds and rivers across Celtic speaking temperate Europe, where expensive objects like swords, jewelry, even purpose made silver model boats were just dumped into the water. This indicates that bodies of water were likely seen as places where the lines between natural and supernatural were blurred, where the gods and men (deuogdonoi in Gaulish) could come into contact, with the intent of currying favours with divine powers by leaving them a sacrifice. It probably safe to say that there was no "pan Celtic" religion with some strict pantheon of gods and heroes, but that divinities were probably associated with different aspects in different regions and maybe even called different names. Nor was there some codified religious scripture despite the fact that druids seem to have existed as some interregional religious political order between Gaul, Britain and Ireland (Caesar mentions the institution of druids was invented in Britain and spread to Gaul, and that some Gaulish druids would travel there to receive instruction). This is just a really long way of saying "we really don know anything but there a couple things we can infer from linguistic and archaeological evidence".

Became aware of multiple ways in which diet might influence smoking and quitting. researchers randomly surveyed 1000 cigarette smokers aged 25 years and older from around the United States, using random digit dialing telephone interviews. They then contacted the participants again 14 months later, asking whether they had abstained from smoking and other tobacco use for at least the previous month.They found that the cigarette smokers who ate fruits and vegetables an average of 4 or more times per day were 3 times more likely to be abstinent from all tobacco products, including cigarettes, 14 months later, compared with those who ate fruits and vegetables fewer than 2 times per day (PThis held true even after controlling for age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, household income, and behavioral indicators of general health orientation.Those who ate more fruits and vegetables also exhibited fewer measures of dependence.They were less likely to smoke 20 or more cigarettes per day (Pwho eat more fruits and vegetables may be more health conscious to begin with and therefore be more amenable to smoking cessation, Haibach said.surveys indicate that people who smoke cigarettes are more likely to binge drink, use illicit drugs, and exercise less, and we controlled for this using exercise, heavy drinking, and street drug use as markers of general health orientation, he added.However, residual confounding may still exist, and the researchers recommend further research, including studies that incorporate all dietary factors and experimental studies.For now, doctors should continue to ask all of their patients about tobacco use.their patients who use tobacco, they should ask about tobacco use at each visit, advise of consequences of tobacco use, assess willingness to quit, assist the patient with a cessation plan, and arrange follow up, including behavioral and pharmaceutical strategies they feel are appropriate for the patient, he said.Doctors can also suggest that patients who are experiencing a cigarette craving eat a piece of fruit, a vegetable, or drink a glass of water help them avoid giving in to the urge to smoke, he added.Scott McIntosh, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at the University of Rochester, in New York, said the study was for finding an important relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and a smoker current level of addiction, as well as their future success with being abstinent from smoking.tells us that future research might not only confirm these relationships but will lead to interventions with smokers to incorporate changes in their diet to increase their chances of being successful with their quit attempts, Dr.

I slept on it and honestly I like the way you played it more. At 100bb I think we could 3b flop and jam most turns, but this deep I don think its a good idea to 3b the third nuts, especially in a spot where the off suit combos of the other two nutted hands are possible. If we compare this to a spot like CO vs BB on a 456r board where we hold 23s on the button and V should not have any combos of 73, and only the suited combos of 78 we could much more reasonably 3b the flop. V would only have 4 combos ahead of us where in the spot were in V could have up to 32 combos ahead of us. I think in reality Q8o doesn always call and KQ sometimes 3bs so its probably closer to half of that but you can see it still a huge difference.

With a starting MSRP of $79,900, the AMG E43 is priced to compete with similar performance oriented luxury sedans which include the Jaguar XF S and BMW M550i. Though both are strong performers, especially the M550i with its twin turbo V8 engine, but neither one can quite match the richly appointed cabin nor polish of the Mercedes. An E63 is more of a thrill, and an E400 would make a better laid back cruiser, but for balancing sportiness with comfort, few others can beat the well roundedness of this package.

I Don Give A Fuck About My Job could potentially abuse his new found power. A manager is usually a manager because they have acquired the knowledge and ability to make tough business decisions and they are held to a higher standard than the employee at the register, so if they fuck up, you better believe that manager is going to get more than a firm talking to about it.

But if you listen to landlords on here or Facebook you get the impression that anyone unfortunate enough to have to rent is the devil incarnate.That says to me landlords are lazy and don properly vet tennants nor are they taking advantage of their rights to inspect the unit every 30 daysI just find it amusing landlords shit talk local tennants and go off trying to make more profit and instead get burned. I have no sympathy for those contributing to the rental crisis. They can have fun paying repairs on their personal hotels.. 
When you come to think about it, many household names Home Depot, Walmart, McDonalds, Amazon entered crowded markets without a clear advantage, yet somehow emerged on top. Likewise, many high flying startups did not begin with an obvious monopoly position or inimitable resources (think Warby Parker or WeWork). Perhaps they accurately predicted that potential competitors would not respond because they were not paying attention or unable to react quickly. Such accurate predictions about competitors' mindset are the mark of strategic intelligence.

That's an interesting spot, I'm thinking that the Aces still make the call. Maybe if they are a super nit and have shitty aces they fold them.

Even with the worst aces possible versus the best aces the equities are going to be so close that you are probably getting the right price to call. It will chop like 58% and the shitty aces will scoop somewhere around 12 15%. Good aces will scoop around 30%

Well wasn't the whole point of her in 358/2 to develop the same set of skills as sora? It'd make sense if they kept her memories all while she developed her skill with the keyblade. Thus, why she kept her memories of Roxas and Axel. Her "data" would have to be updated during her learning process..

Nobody Home is a ready choice here in a tricky opener. Eddie Cawley will have targeted this race, as it suits the horse rating, and given the ease of his hurdles win two outings ago off 113, he is surely well treated over fences off 115, even if he suffered defeat in this discipline last time. The trip may have been at fault then.. 
Been a nice ride   occasionally we had to deal with an ahole player refusing to pay for his losses. Issue is that you just need to have a non negative balance to not be suspended. So technically someone could start with zero funds to be eligible to play and drop $800 in one night and refuse to pay before a suspension is placed for having a negative balance.

It's an app that hosts communities for different things. Its was advertised a lot on fandom YouTube videos for a while.

I always aim to do a 5 or 10km tempo, intervals/fartleks, hills/stairs, and a long run every week. For the last two months, I run every day but I do try to alternate between a training run and an or run. Unfortunately I think I tend to do all my runs instead of hard days hard, easy days easy, and it is probably what is hurting my performance the most. I have a hard time sticking to any strength training or stretching and often neglect both (need to fix my mindset on these). Two years ago I was a couch potato who loathed running. Now I obsessed with it, so I just need to figure out how to feel that way about strength. The last few months I averaged 60km/week. I rested from Thursday (Which felt really weird after a two month streak). I did start carb loading a bit on Wednesday, and drank plenty of water.

I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.

The millions of dollars Blumstein earned probably won go toward buy ins at high roller poker tournaments, though.
