The degradation of democratic norms and the pillars that Western democracy is predicated upon are under constant assault from the Trump administration and online disinformation campaigns across the globe. We are living under precarious circumstances with an unclear and rocky future. I will admit that there are times where even I feel overwhelmed. But I reminded of all the wonderful people who I have had the privilege to meet, to live with, to work with, to teach, to inspire and all those wonderful souls I have not met but I know exist and would love to meet. I write summaries through my own moral conviction. I cannot stand aside and watch our world be torn down fear and hatred. I will never give up in the face of adversity, when what we know as good and moral is under assault.
I had a similar experience where i met a chick at a local highschool party and we had a night of drunken fun. i had to leave early so i wouldn wake her parents up. i left my number on her bedroom door with a post it along with my AIM.

What the fuck is wrong with you: A lot. But as I said, we work our asses off too fucking hard to be sitting watching a game with $20 on the line. What the fuck does that do for us?

You may feel pushed to borrow, sell, or even steal things for gambling money.Have family and friends worried about you. Denial keeps problem gambling going. If friends and family are worried, listen to them carefully. It not a sign of weakness to ask for help. Many older gamblers are reluctant to reach out to their adult children if they gambled away their inheritance, but it never too late to make changes for the better.Self help for gambling problemsThe biggest step to overcoming a gambling addiction is realizing that you have a problem. 
Go through your database and look at how these river check/jam spots play out, like 95% of players underbluff here and almost no one overbluffs even though it actually a very good spot to bluff due to range advantage.
I know this is a bit of a tangent, but is age 3 an ideal age for something as massive as Disney World? At that age they don't really comprehend what's special about it. 
Can you expand on that? I currently building a stitch and glue dinghy and have looked at a lot of plans. All of the clinker built boats I looked at definitely do have frames. Some are sawn to fit around the laps in the planking and others are steamed to shape and riveted through the planks. I can see how the shallow draft would make decks impractical on long ships, but I don see how they can get away without having frames to give the riveted planking shape.
Not pushing chips on all bets does not really matter. On an all in you only need to throw out one chip. It is easy to make your intention clear. It is easy for you to force them to make their intention clear. If you don't want to ask them then ask the dealer.
Tilting usually occurs when you get an outcome that you did not want or expect   for instance, losing an all in with AA, the best pre flop hand in No Limit Texas Hold Statistically you win that about 80% of the time, so the 20% of times that you do end up losing the hand can become emotionally frustrating.

Keep in mind that people in this group are no different than anyone else and want to avoid paying taxes if possible.

Not religious but, you can quote passages from Leviticus all day but that's not going to mean shit to them. Most Christians now adays follow new testament which essentially makes all the fire and brimstone shit null and void. After Jesus died for our sins, all the old rules went with him.

I explicitly said I wanted to be at my parent house by 6pm (hour drive) for thanksgiving cause that is when my brother would be arriving and I was really looking forward to seeing him, and he fucked it up. An hour before we had to leave I was packed and ready, and he was still doing nothing. When it was actually time to leave, I was standing at the door with bags in hand and the big manchild said out loud that he needed some milk and cookies. He completely ignoring me saying we needed to go now cause this was important to me. As he sat down with his milk and fucking cookies, I told him I had it and was driving myself there and he could follow. When ex did arrive, he was grumpy because he had to drive and he hates driving and was basically an asshole the rest of the night. Instead of spending the rare time with my whole fam, I spent nearly an hour trying to soothe/get him set up in the den with tv so he wouldn be such a cunt to be around. There had been a lot of similar selfish stuff, but this event was the straw.

But how exactly would children be harmed by peeping in a man window and seeing him set the coffee to "brew" while he scratched his underwear free private parts?

Making Dietary Changes: A handful of studies have shown that different changes in the infant's diet (or the mother's, if she's breastfeeding) can sometimes help colicky babies. Some studies showed that eliminating dairy products3 or using hypoallergenic diets4 worked. No one diet worked for all the babies, so it's likely that just a subset of colicky babies would respond to these diets.

If you have the money to waste, go for it. The point of layering it is this: the ramp will skate faster when you are riding with the grain and slower when you are riding across the grain. Diagonal layering may provide the best compromise, but it tends to be a big pain in the ass and a waste of plywood. I suggest putting the surface on so that the grain runs lengthwise on the ramp. You cover more ground going back and forth than you do along the coping, so this should make it nice and fast.
There are a couple of units that are better in every stat than another (F!Takumi vs Clarisse or Mia vs Athena), but its a really small amount that ends up being insignificant.Newer units tend to have a higher stat total, but the distribution of stats matter so old units might be better with some builds because of how their stats are distributed.Every update some old units get a new, unique weapon and/or a refine which gives them a new effect. This helps them have their niche.They recently added the dragonflowers which you can use to improve a unit stats (maximum of +1 to each stat, or +2 if they infantry units released before the mechanic was implemented).

Seems to me the implication is photos were possibly taken by BoD of TH (unknowingly) during previous visits. Seems like much more than a coincidence that deletions were made during exact time frames TH was at salvage yard.

THEREFORE, when Peter PARKER (Spider Man) goes missing in New York during Spider Man 2, he reappears on an undercover assignment in the Pacific Ocean disguised as a tiger, only the plan went haywire, and the ship was wrecked. So deep undercover, Spider Man couldn't afford to let the gig slip, so he maintained his cover as the tiger Richard (Dick) PARKER, who Pi Patel fucked on a regular basis because he was a lonely adolescent teenage boy, only problem is: they developed a deeper relationship, so when Pi Patel says his final goodbye, Peter Parker (Spider Man) says his catchphrase "you'll always know where to find me.", and so therefore the final scene where Mary Jane says "go get 'em tiger" at the end of Spider Man 2, she is willingly giving Peter Parker permission to don the identity of Dick (Richard) Parker the Tiger for one last booty call from Pi Patel
I totally did the same thing, but with the "Quidditch World Cup" and dice. Would group every country in the world, plus a few territories (South Ossetia and Macau did particularly well), into regional playoffs per continent, and slooooooowly build up to the final.

Instead, we laid on hard brown sand, hurt our feet walking over rocks into strong waves, and ate some sort of greasy chicken and potatoes for lunch.

But why not make it easier on yourselves, talk to your pastor about eloping and getting married, like tomorrow! You can have the wedding ceremony later!

The payout for blackjack depends on many small variations of the rule. Some of these rules that should be given concern are: how many decks of cards are being used?

The fact that busting out means you lose all of your equity in the prize pool, while doubling up does not double your equity, means that to play for a lot of chips early on, you need to have a big advantage. In Texas hold'em sit and go tournaments such opportunities come up fairly often, such as with having a big pair preflop, or hitting a set on the flop, making a flush, etc. But in Omaha SNG's most hands are only about a 6:5 favorite preflop and even after a favorable flop for your hand has hit your opponents will usually be drawing very live. The result is that you should play very tight early on, even tighter than in hold'em sng tournaments, waiting for only the most absolute premium hands like a pair of aces with a wheel card, or A23x. This can be quite boring and would be easy to take advantage of in a cash game, but is the correct Omaha sng strategy.

The setup for a couples massage is pretty standard: Massage tables are placed next to each other in a "couples suite" so you and your lady can get massages at the same time. At some spas, the masseuses will do a choreographed massage so both people get the same experience at the same time. Other spas will let each person pick what kind of massage to get   hard and fast, soft and gentle, whatever you want. Either way, both massages will start and end at the same time so nobody has to wait around.

When I would do home "inspections" (for greyhounds, so large breed) it was mostly to check that there wasn something that was an imminent danger to a dog.

Clay composite poker chips are the most popular in use outside of casinos today. They may be a little pricy but they will last just as long as do clay chips. They are called clay composite because the molds are made from a mixture of clay and other materials. A piece of metal is inserted in the middle of the composite chip inlay increasing its overall weight. Composite chips typically weigh from 11.5 to 13.5 grams.

Tourist visas are free if you leave after 30 days, or $30ish(?) if you want a visa that can be renewed for another 30 days. Then you need to cover airfare to someplace outside Indonesia (usually Singapore is cheapest, but Bangkok, Perth, Darwin, and Kuala Lumpur are options too), and often an overnight stay in one of these places. A social cultural visa costs differently depending on where you get it (outside the country), think $50 $150 (look on embassy/consulate websites for specifics), and lasts 60 days.

Sometimes, as the young women in these relationships get older, they start to see the truth, and want their partner to mature and change with them, but it doesn happen, so they break up.

The Kahnawake became the unlikely hosts for computer servers that handle not only Norton's companies but many of the world's biggest online poker businesses. In this edition of Reporter's Notebook, Gaul explains how this came to be:
Hand 1 you've got bottom set on a full spade board and are last to act. I would advocate betting here for the exact reason you stated. You want other players calling with a naked spade or even pair + spade draw because you're way ahead of every hand except a flopped flush. You want to deny their equity and you have position. Checking just let's garbage hands catch up especially when it's multi way.

You are also a famous Afreeca TV BJ which you record from your home in the United States. The overwhelming majority of your viewers are Korean. You are not gainfully employed by any entity in the US. As such, you cannot apply for an employment visa in the US and surely, Uncle Sam won care if you don pay a dime. In this scenario, it not even a question of whether Never3forget should apply for an employment visa, like a green card   he simply cannot. This logic also applies (I am assuming) to South Korea where I imagine labor and taxation statutes to be very similar.

Course, Fallout 76 is its own problem. It going to be tricky for them to support the game and talk about updates while also trying to create distance from it for Starfield.

Poker dice can be a fun game of chance, but it isn't poker. You could never win a game with a losing hand with poker dice. In that regard, one pair of dice is as good as any other. (Full Answer)

It was only in 2004 that two psychologists Russell Hill and Robert Barton at the University of Durham began to wonder whether humans might react in a similar way. Although we don tend to flush a vivid, inflamed red like a mandrill, we do sometimes burn up with anger. So the sight of red clothes could perhaps carry associations of aggression and dominance. Hill and Barton were stuck for ways to investigate the idea, however, until the 2004 Olympics gave them the perfect opportunity. In combat sports like boxing and tae kwon do, the athletes were randomly assigned either red or blue kits, allowing the scientists to compare the same athletes performances when they were wearing different colours.

During the Cold War, American and Soviet military leaders temporarily forgot why nuclear bombing yourself was a bad idea.

If you get a part and start rehearsing together then you can go deeper with the personal questions. You can just start asking for personal advice the first day you meet someone, or when the friendship is still very casual.

I personally still hate the idea that you write one workout for your entire gym population, and then scale it down for a couple people, even if the workout ends up looking almost nothing like the original. There are some people who should have their workouts written specifically FOR THEM, individualized because of their needs. I mean, there's a reason there is an entire field of physical therapy dedicated to the elderly: their problems are unique and while their needs are TECHNICALLY the same as an elite athlete, the degree is so much different you can hardly call it the same thing..

I specifically have problems with how Shield Hero presents these lame story beats with seemingly zero self awareness, or any consideration with how such reductive characterization could be read and absorbed by its audience in 2018. And for those of you clamoring about my trying to assert my "Western values" on a Japanese work, the blog entry here quotes articles that highlight how Japanese culture has a huge issue with supporting women who are victims of assault, and how badly those archaic perspectives need to change..

Rio de Janeiro City has benefited from low supply growth combined with steady demand improvements of 0.4 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, between 2009 and 2011 on an annual compound basis.

A free poker league like Nutz isn't protected by the state's exemption for penny ante games, either.

Was trying to take a bit of his confidence. He was walking me down fairly well behind the jab. He cut me in the fourth and I think that upped his confidence. I never could get control of the pace though. In spots I felt I was giving up less ground and I had him missing. He got back on his groove though and he had a strong advantage.
I hate discouraging someone from reading ever lol, but another con to reading the book now is it's kind of hard to talk about the show without referencing the book or without your discussion being informed by what you already know from the book.

Most people go through a growth between 16 25 where they have several sexual and/or emotional relationships  so understand that those 4 years spent with you meant she wasn out in the dating pool, going through a bunch of trash dudes.

This question could would be best answered if you have a basic understanding of combinatorics (the study of combinations and permutations and probability) however, for something with as few possibilities as this, it is often easier to just make a list.

Will Smith is a bit over the top, and it is narrated like the average viewer age is 12, but the content itself is designed for adult brains.

But the detective I talked to asked a lot of questions to corroborate the account, and said in these cases they really try to avoid going to trial, because witness intimidation is a real thing and you're pretty easy to find after testifying about something that happened in/near your home or business. Witnesses just don't want to even come to court, so if they can't get a plea, there's usually no trial. And I suppose no trial means technically unsolved..

I worked as a housekeeper for 7 years and knew most of the return guests by name and tried to memorize all their preferences in the rooms. On the 7th year, I was promoted to manager. This one family came 2x a year and rented out half the hotel. They were the nicest and friendliest guests. They would always tip when I cleaned their rooms, then brought me food every night when i was manager. (when they bbq or went out) I had a good relationship with the son and father of the family. When I finally decided to move on from the hotel, it was bittersweet. I let them know and they wished me luck. When the father checked out, he left a bag for me at the front desk. (not unusual, it was almost always cookies or leftovers) Inside was the wooden box. He was a hobby carpenter and had carved it by hand for me with my name on it. Its nothing amazing, but the sentiment and symbol of the almost ten year friendship made it very important to me.

I currently 28+2 and still cycling. I plan to go as long as possible. With my last, I didn have any of the issues other people have described, probably because I wasn moving around/up/off my saddle constantly. I was also able to sit up frequently if needed (hands free).

The next decade, active safety systems will become increasingly intelligent as greater efforts are made to reduce the number of road fatalities worldwide, said TRW chairman and CEO John Plant. automated functions will be introduced that will operate continuously in certain situations in addition to providing emergency support when needed. At IAA 2013, TRW is outlining its portfolio of semi automated driving functions. Moreover, we will see a greater market penetration of both active and passive safety technologies as new mandates, changes to NCAP schemes and insurance incentives come into force worldwide. Our technology roadmap has been specifically designed to support these trends and to ensure that our systems are affordable for all vehicle segments and in all markets. highlights include:

Getting used to the money is a bit of a challenge for me   being blonde and all. John and I ate at quite a very nice restaurant while Pete was having a scan and the food was beautiful, so I thought I'd give them a tip. When the waitress brought the change back to us in the little money folder, as they do, I left a note in the folder as a tip. John said   "Susie, how much did you leave for the tip?" and I proudly said 1rmb. The look of astonishment on John's face prompted me to ask (because I thought I'd left way too much)   'why is that too much, how much is that?' John said very straightlaced and straightfaced   "Twenty five cents". Well I nearly died   'how embarrassment!!!' We just could not stop laughing. I don't think we'll be going back there any time soon.

The problem with saving the kursi is that while doing so state institutions are the first ones to bear the brunt of all this wheeling and dealing. Our constitution today resembles a thirty year old model who has had every imaginable form of plastic surgery to stay young. The only difference is that unlike the model who has a certain plastic aesthetic to her, our constitution has started looking uglier than ever. The damage to institutions is for all of us to see. We need to get the Supreme Court to intervene to get just about anything done right whether it is fixing the traffic mess in a city or to ensure that greedy politicians and builders don't tear down our few remaining trees.

The Bike Hotel is really expensive and there is nothing to do around that side of the city to be honest. I would really recommend getting an AirBnB anywhere on the West Side of LA, maybe Venice so you are within scootering distance of the beach/Abbot Kinney? Taking one of those sidewalk scooters around the beach walk would be fun for anyone. Staying on the west side will also give you access to the free Getty Museum, Getty Villa, and Malibu beaches within driving distance as well. Parking might be challenging if you are renting a car is main thing to figure out. You could Uber to Hollywood Park from there for not much.

Free material is all well and good, but the noise:signal ratio is overwhelming even when you have a clue, for a newer player it would be impossible to sort out the quality material from the mediocre or harmful.
