Honestly, and this is a thing that would pissed me off five years ago: time. In our early twenties my husband and I were happy with us and our dogs and our home, our goals and our adventures, and were sure we never wanted a baby. Then in our later twenties that opinion softened and at 29 I woke up one day and said "I been thinking for a long time and I think I might want to have a baby" and he said "oh thank god me too and I didn know how to tell you." Now we have a toddler and we have lost absolutely nothing (well, a few hundred dollars in baby gear and a bit of sleep) and gained a family member.

3. Levels means thinking about what you have, what your opponent has, what your opponent thinks you have, what your opponent thinks you think he/she has, and so on. Thinking beyond the first two or three levels is rarely necessary in low limit Hold'em, but as you advance in limits and as your opponents become stronger players, it becomes necessary to think on many levels. Remember that poker is a game of information, and the better your opponents play, the more information you will need to be successful.

Greek mythology long ago recognized that hubris usually gives way to nemesis. Wodehouse once wrote in his inimitable style, it is just when "a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping." Will Stout's ability to take measured risks help him navigate these threats and achieve his dream of financial independence? Or will his gambler's instinct prevail and impel him to extend himself too far? If the latter were to happen, Stout might have no choice but to turn his eyes to heaven and plead   as the factory worker Everett had done years earlier   "Make me even and I'll never gamble again.".

But still, that girl lecturing you on not understanding her, that is the rude thing. I wouldn't say men are simple, more. direct. Women are raised with the idea that we can't be direct, it's not seen as feminine. (For example, girls encouraging each other to play hard to get. Thankfully this is much less common) it's also seen as not polite to be blunt, it's why some girls are afraid to say no to people, even if they're being harassed. There's this constant pressure to be seen as pleasant, kind, empathetic, gentle and motherly, just look at any commercial focused towards women.

Tax return reports last years income. Landlord need to know if applicant's current income is sufficient to cover rent and other expenses. Typically, Landlord wants tenant's monthlyincome before taxesto be approximately 3 times the monthly rent. For example, if rent is $1,000 than tenant's monthly income should be at least $3,000 to cover rent and other personal expenses. How do you verify self employed person's income? Request last 3 months of personal bank statements (not business bank statements because the tenant's business is not signing the lease, the business owner   the person is signing the lease so you want to verify his personal income). If the business owner does not have personal bank account in which he deposits personal income, than the business owner's income can not be verify and therefore do not rent to this person. Also you do not want his business bank account because thebusiness has their own expenses and as stated before the business is not signing the lease. Also keep in mind the the business should be established for at least 1 year because of the high risk of new business failing. There are more details that should also be considered.

There were also roving traders with whom we could trade items. All scouts were encouraged to bring little bits and baubles from home to trade for things like Gold or character upgrades. The cool thing was that the traders would give you a better deal the more imaginative you could be with the item you were trying to trade. So marbles weren just marbles, you had to come up with this really great story about what they are, what their purpose is, and how you came to acquire it. The better the story, the better the trade.

He was never a three point shooter, but he used to be money from mid range. That includes fadeaways off the glass when posting up. It used to be one of his main staples on offense. We've seen that in small glimpses this season. I'm confident that those aspects of his game will return. The thing I saying is, he was never really a reliable shooter, you would prefer a WB taking shots at the rim and going full speed in transition or PnR, so thats why I saying, now that we have PG13, please russell turn into rondo and let my man george get the perimeter buckets hahaha

My very first painting is still hanging up in my grandmothers house, everyone thinks (to this day) that it great. My second painting was hung up over my fathers death bed (he requested it). I didn find out about that until months later, as I was out of country at the time. I did both paintings as a follow along while the show was live on TV, I didn have a VCR or anything and the picture was grainy. My point here is anyone can paint his stuff and you love it for life.

(a sure loser is a fish, and a tuna is a big fish), just sits at the table looking massive. He hasn't much choice; but if he's winning (which he is, just now) and you're not, maybe your mind wanders, and you begin wondering just how much he can see through those bottle bottom glasses, or whether the toothpick he's chewing is the same one he started the day with.

When you're sailing the seas, surrounded by nothing more than serene ocean waves it's tough to get into a more relaxed state of mind. But if ultimate tranquility is what you seek, then head to the ship's spa. Most ship spas offer classic massages and facials, but some spas stand out from the rest and feature soothing treatments and striking venues that are truly unique. The Solarium indoor pool is among the prettiest pools at sea with waterfalls and dancing water fountains. Before and after treatments guests can lounge with sea views in the Relaxation Room that offers comfy and plush wicker ottomans or the spa's Persian Garden that offers warm marble lounges to laze on. The spa offers a wide array of treatments, but acupuncture therapy is the highlight and is very popular among returning guests.

Two straight guys saying they are going to "rape" each other in a computer game isn politically incorrect because there a very little chance of the literal act actually taking place; just like two white people saying they are going to lynch one another, it isn politically incorrect. But saying you are going to "rape" a girl in jest is indeed being a misogynist because the vast majority of rape cases over our history as a society have been enacted on woman. Just like saying in jest that you going to lynch your black friend might get you in trouble, because of the historical significance of said act upon said people :)

This is a good time to point out something that is often confusing to beginning players when computing pot odds. The beginning player often thinks he already has so much money in the pot and believes that this somehow goes into the computation of the pot odds. The fact of the matter is any money already in the pot is not yours. It was yours before you put it into the pot, and the only way you will get it back is to win the pot. This is the reason that money you have already placed into the pot is not used in computing pot odds.

Joysticks are somewhat more unintuitive for camera movement, though. They rate/velocity inputs, which are great for movement (push a little to walk, push more to run, etc). But for looking around, your natural progression is: I want to look at that  > point head at it. For a mouse this is very intuitive, as your mouse movement maps well to head movement. With a joystick, you not saying "point my head at this thing", you saying "turn my head in this direction at X degrees/sec, then stop". With practice you can get good at it, and maybe with long enough be equally good with both, but it a much more difficult time learning to do that with a joystick.

In general, the more pain you experience, the more sensitive to pain you become.There are, however, some intriguing hints that the long hours of training endured by Olympic athletes produce the opposite effect.

Also no company should have a security flaw which is still being actively exploited 30 days after they were made aware of the problem. Software patches take time and investigations need to happen but all starts with pulling the insecure systems off the internet and leaving them disconnected until the issue is resolved. The only justification for leaving those systems online are if they are critical such as the software you find in some medical equipment (which can still often be disconnected or cut off from the internet at large) or cases involving major internet infrastructure..

This kid window shows up broken tomorrow, or if he gets jumped on the street, he going to know it was you. Let this simmer for some time, make him think you forgot, and start planning. Can you anonymously report him to the honor court for cheating on a test? Could you leave some beer cans outside his dorm so his RA searches him for drugs/alc? Could you fake a summons by your school student conduct telling him he been accused of assault? Can you convince one of your sweethearts into sleeping with him, then rob him blind/shit in his laundry?

Its amazing what positive impact daycare has on a child. I use to believe that being a stay at home parent was more benifical but what are they learning? Unless you know the fundamental basic of motor skills and cognitive curriculum learning, a child who is home all the time doesnt generally learn and develop as quickly as those who do. Besides if it helps a child learn and the parent gets independance to work and support themself there should be more of this, more support.

Sizing on the flop was good, was poor on the turn as it leaves us with like $2 behind in a $5.5 pot. We can expect to ever get folds betting that sizing, so when we shove we only have value. And since any turn bluff would want to preserve a SPR capable of generating some folds with a river shove, we can be bluffing on the turn either. Your sizing is impossible to balance. Would go with $1 or so on the turn.

In the East, the mantra is "purify yourself" or "purify your qi". Very good advice. The Eastern cultures (I thinking largely of Japanese and Chinese) are excellent at self will. These are cultures in which self improvement and self cultivation are highly valued and taught to children from birth. In other words, it easy for someone like Master Kimura to simply say, "you just need to purify yourself". In the West, the way that Westerner (in part somewhat irregardless of one actual cultural background) approach self will and self cultivation is different.

And that what happened   using high AMP as well in an obvious exploit of conditions otherwise intended to make a comparison between human and machine strategic intelligence..

Say you've had a rough week at the office, and you're yearning to treat yourself to some much deserved rest and relaxation. You've been feeling tense, so you decide that the perfect way to unwind is to indulge yourself with a massage. Even though you might think that is just a good way to kick back, massage actually comes with a ton of medically proven health benefits, one of which is improved circulation in your cardiovascular and lymphatic systems. When you get a massage, your circulation is improved due to physical manipulation of soft tissue and chemicals released as a part of your body's response to relaxation.

A large part of being a successful (read:professional) poker player is money management, or knowing when to use the money you're playing with to your best advantage. To that end, very few players can last long enough to be long time pros without having an extraordinary sense of discipline as it pertains to their money on the table. I would say that most, if not nearly all, professional poker players (read: people who pay their house payment with their winnings) are not addicted in the classical sense.

Would like to see this stablized, but overall a long, reasonably clear footage of this silent craft. (Made a mistake in locale   it is Little Elm, TX). Witness report is as follows, "I am reporting more than one UFO, I witnessed 3 different aircrafts in one night while getting fast food in my car. I was on my way to get fast food, while driving I saw an intense huge light hovering them passing trough the trees. Once I grabbed my camera inside my car and attached photo lens I could see little details of this craft. Without looking trough the camera it looked like a huge blob of light flying around the neighborhood. On the following video I have attached here you be able to see how this air craft was moving and you get to see the details of it. I strongly believe this is definitely not human made, the strange thing about it, is that it made no sound. I have seen airplanes passed where I live during the night and I know how they look and sound and that one had me very confused. One the video I was able to include the other air crafts. What is also strange is: I don know if they were aware of me filming them but every time I tried to get closer and a better look, they went behind me and hid behind tress and buildings."

I did not make the assumption that all natives were better teachers and never said so. My stance had nothing to do with the words that you put in my mouth and everything to do with what I actually said, which was that non natives shouldn be hired to teach English.

The event is fantastic, very friendly and well organised. The swim course has a nice wide start area that reduces the crush; water was 19 degrees when I did it.
