In arriving at his decision, Justice Conlan noted that proliferation of self represented litigants in family law cases is here to stay. I suspect that there are many reasons for that: cuts to legal aid services, the self help resorted to on the world wide web, and (let us not be so naive to ignore) the voluntary choice by some litigants to act for themselves because they think that the judge will be forced into being their advocate. What may be a warning to individuals who choose to represent themselves for strategic reasons, the judge noted is time that we recognize that there are some (not most, maybe even not many) persons who can readily afford legal counsel but simply choose to act for themselves because they think that it will provide them a tactical edge in the courtroom.

In a first scene, I saw myself getting married with my first love. Guests have joined our wedding.

Instead of all this, I know in my heart that my groom loves me as passionately as I love him; and he is glad to marry me   just like me.

The PML (N) too has a trump card in the shape of PPP governments in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, which could be overthrown any time the PML (N) wants. But right now Asif Zardari seem to have a better hand at the table. And he happens to be a better player too when it comes to political poker. His call to Tahirul Qadri was a master shot to exert pressure on the PML (N). Even PPP minions were seen cutting personal deals. A Sindhi member was found pressuring a minister in the lobbies to have two 'friends' appointed in Attorney General's office. The PPP leverage will increase the messier it turns.

Working in his grandmother's basement, he fabricated underwear from a synthetic fiber. It was light and moisture wicking, but the yarn was widely available, making the concept easy to imitate. Yet the initial lack of proprietary materials, technology or brand name somehow did not stop UnderArmour from growing. Competitors were slow to catch on to the idea, and Plank became the youngest entrant to the Forbes list of billionaires, growing the start up into a multibillion dollar behemoth.

There might be some better plan than that, but it would make the situation for attributes alone balanced at least. 
Women in technology jobs are overwhelmingly outnumbered by their male counterparts. At TipTap Lab, we have about an even mix of men and women working in our departments, including our engineering and technology team. This isn't something that should be terribly surprisingly. One might imagine that, since the population of the US has a gender ratio of approximately 50/50, the gender ratio in technology jobs would be the same. Unfortunately, the welcoming working environment and equal gender ratio at TipTap Lab are the exception, rather than the rule. [You can view the recording here.]
Reading a book prominently recognizing lynchings in the south, reading about how in 1963, while searching for the corpses of 3 civil rights activists the search party stumbled across the lynched corpses of 8 unreleated black men pounded home the hell out of the pervasiveness of racism helped me formulate my thoughts on how ludicrous it is to think legal changes ended racism and its impact on politics, the notion that anti LGBT bigotry ended with Obergefell is ludicrous.. 
We know what happens during a hiccup. During normal breathing, we take in air from the mouth and nose, and it flows through the pharynx, past the glottis and into the larynx and trachea, ending in the lungs. The diaphragm, a large muscle between the chest and abdomen, aids this airflow. It moves down when we inhale, and then up when we exhale. The phrenic nerves control the movement and sensation of the diaphragm. Any irritation to these nerves induces a spasm of the diaphragm. This spasm causes a person to take a short, quick breath that is then interrupted by the closing of the epiglottis (a flap that protects the glottis, the space between the vocal cords). The sudden closing creates the sound we all know as a hiccup.

Given the absolutely ridiculous way the game tries at the very end of Forsaken to make out like somehow you "just as bad" as Uldren for killing him after he shows no remorse whatsoever for unleashing xenocidal nutjobs on the Reef, I can help but feel like Bungie is going to run with this ridiculous story where the hapless cast of NPCs are going to question the order of events that we were literally there for.

In the same year that those bottom 20 million taxpayers paid 50bn in income tax, the net wealth of the UK rose by nearly half a trillion pounds, yet almost none of that gain was taxed.

"You get stage fright because you are a nice person. Mean people never get stage fright!" The cab driver yells into the backseat at me. My fingers are gripping the seat tightly and I'm trying to calculate the tensile stregth of the seatbelt as Zemede blows through a red light at 65 miles per hour. I called ahead and asked for a cab at 8:30pm exactly so I could get to the improv show a little before nine. They sent me Zemede at 8:10 pm and I was certain we'd get there by 8:19pm and not a second later. After we arrived, Zemede ran my credit card, as I tried to swallow my internal organs back into place. "You want I should leave tip?" He asks and raises an eyebrow at me. "Three dolla," I say to him. He nods approvingly and adds three bucks onto my already expensive cab ride. What the hell do I know, I never take cabs. Are you supposed to tip? Am I supposed to tip more because he got me here at the speed of light? The last time I was in the backseat of a cab, I was drunk and concentrating on not barfing on the floorboards. I don't remember paying, let a lone tipping. Thank the goddess for good friends who do all that stuff for me when I'm incapacitated.

In the past (emphasize on past, lately, not so much) China has made it clear it is willing to maintain the status quo as long as the ROC government claims that there is one China.

Thus our constitution still states we own the land China to maintain the status quo..

As the aforesaid description lays a crystal clear emphasis on the online games, let's come back to the heart of the discussion that is online card games. As the name itself suggests the games which played over some network of computers, using cards, the same bags itself with a very enormous and diverse range of varieties of card games which can be played online on real time basis. Therefore let's have a look into the different kinds of online card games into depth to have a clear vision of the same. As the name suggests, the game is played with the aid of a trick hence, every single player puts a single card away from his hand. After finishing the game off, each player is made to turn the face down and is taken away from the play. Ultimately, a single player will be left with the lead for every single trick and the rest will play according to their bodily situation. The description of both are as follows:

I feel, despite what some will say, that would limit your play style too much, even if there were different factions and endings.

For example, you could spend 150 EUR on training sites over some number of months, play a ton of hands, get a bunch of practice with the concepts, then pay a good coach 100 EUR to review some hands, look through your database to plug leaks, etc. Then you could invest another 250 EUR plus HALF of the money you make in poker into content, coaching, whatever. That basically the offer you should compare to something like BPC. The first option will have much more flexibility overall and less risk, especially in the short term. BPC could be vastly superior if it would take a lot of time and effort to get out of the micros; it would also cap your monetary investment into poker skill assuming you could follow the program requirements. There also the community aspect of being grouped with like minded individuals.

El Pino is pretty good food wise, but many people in the adoptee community avoid him due to his toxic personality.

Luongo finished in 634th position in the Main Event at the 43rd World Series of Poker in 2012. Although finishing in the 600's may not sound like a major accomplishment, the fact that Luongo managed to outlast just under 6,000 players at a tournament where top amateurs challenge the best poker players on the planet, Bobby Lou should be proud of his accomplishment.

Due to the decreased relative contribution of the hip adductors in cycling, I believe this is less likely. Alternatively, two muscles that attach below the knee joint that are capable of producing the pain you describe are gracilis (also a hip adductor, but crosses the knee joint), and sartorius. The action of sartorius is to flex the knee, flex the hip, and internally rotate the hip. When cycling and strongly pulling up on the pedals (as in a seated, low cadence climb), sartorius is powerfully contracting and can lead to both a tendon friction injury across the medial joint line (inside of the knee) and also an inflammation of the bursa (fluid filled sac designed to reduce friction) at its insertion (attachment) below the knee. 
When the vaccine for chickenpox first came out, most people thought it was very stupid. Some research was done, and they said something like 9 out of 10 teenagers would choose the vaccine over dealing with chickenpox.

It not because it a deadly disease it really isn more out of convenience.

I think a good way of looking at it is comparing starting a poker career/hobby to getting a job at McDonalds. If you start from just a baseline level of poker knowledge, or played in the past, how much time would it take studying to get to the point of profitability and then playing to make as much money if you had just been working at McDonalds the whole time? Obviously hard to know exactly but I guess about three years would be a good outcome.

So, on the while I am exasperated by all the 'how dare you' brigade but I believe it's part of growing up and, in the whole, it has helped mentalities evolve in the right direction, even if it has allowed a voice to the crazies and profiteers. The latter are also part of humanity, a bit regrettable but free speech is not a pick and choose buffet.

So, it may be possible to find something, but free housing will not be as available as in other countries. And finding an entire WG empty at the same time, with the inhabitants willing to rent out all their rooms to you, is highly unlikely.
The real reason to change is to extend our own time and give future generations a chance to reach and populate space.

I have a ridiculously over the top headcanon to compensate for this, given that in the DoTD novelisation, 9 smashed mirrors in an effort to never have to see his own gaze. I can totally see 9 travelling around for hundreds of years refusing to see himself, until finally feeling confident that maybe he saved enough people to make up for the lives he took that day and earned his old life back. Still wrestling with the idea, he takes little steps to force himself into giving in to the desire, one of which would be to finally see himself, breaking that one little rule that holding him back..

Two cards should not be drawn to a pair unless an ace or king can be retained with them, except for the purpose of a "bluff." If most of the other players are "in," the chances of drawing an ace or a king are not quite so good as those of drawing a small card, because the other players are more likely to be staying in on high than on low cards. The probabilities of such being the case are of course quite impossible to determine, but they are very slight and are more than' compensated by the chances of increasing the comparative value of the hand by making aces or kings "up" instead of two small pairs'. Thus, while it has been well said that the actual mathematical expectations of improving such a hand are greater by drawing, three cards, yet it cannot be denied that the practical value of the hand is much enhanced by a successful twos card draw. The odd card should only be retained with a small pair   that is, on the merits of which the pot cannot, presumably, be won say a pair of nines or under.
I said "choke" I didn mean it in the normal sense of the word, since food is not getting stuck in my airway, it is getting stuck in my esophagus. I can still breathe when this happens.

Sexuality becomes something "other" people have. And those other people are not, of course, as fully human as "people like us." And so debating whether homosexuals should be executed becomes "good journalism." If the journalists at the BBC had stopped for a moment and asked "If I were queer, would I ask this question?

It not really up for debate.

By the mid 1990s, a revolution in trading had occurred; the old school grizzled traders had been replaced by a new breed of quantitative analysts, applying mathematics to the "art" of trading and making of it a science. Similarly in poker, for decades, the highest level of pokers have been dominated by players who have learned the game by playing it, "road gamblers" who have cultivated intuition for the game and are adept at reading other players' hands from betting patterns and physical tells.

Chinese Mandarin can be easy to learn, or it can be extremely difficult. It mainly depends on your sensitivity to the tones. If you have a good ear for tones, you will be able to distinguish them easily when you hear them, and mimic them in your speech with little effort. The flexible grammatical rules also make learning Mandarin pretty easy. But if you struggle with tones, both aurally and verbally, then you are going to struggle mightily to learn Mandarin, or any other tonal language. Reading Chinese is, of course, the biggest challenge to learning the language, no matter how good you are with tones. Chinese reading comprehension can be mastered by anyone, regardless of your aptitude for language, but you have to be willing to put in a lot of time, and a lot of repetition, to memorize the couple thousand characters needed for basic reading comprehension. It will definitely help to have a good visual memory. It a wonderful language, and I highly recommend that everyone with an interest give it a shot. The tones and pictographs may seem intimidating at first, but try a class for a semester or two, and see how it goes.

In basic, we were only allowed so many rolls of TP a week. As a female flight who was not made aware of this rule until it was too late, we struggled to adapt. It was rough. People were using rags, we were trying to force our way into stalls at chow, the whole nine yards. Once, someone (coined the poopetrator) hoarded all our remaining TP, and we were going to be out for 6 days. We had no communication with any other flights, and our MTI had gone for the night. It had also been bean night at chow. You know where I'm going with this. Luckily, that night, our brother flight had pulled out too much TP from their closet. The closet automatically locks, so they couldn't put it away, but they'd get in trouble if they were found with extra. Communication was strictly forbidden between us, but the cameras rotated away from our door for 60 seconds every hour. They came banging like the devil on our door, but our two shortest guards were on EC, so they couldn't see what was going on. Brother flight threw toilet paper up, so ECs realized what was going on. We had seconds to open the door and get the TP before the camera rotated back and we were all fucked. We threw open the door, our smallest and fastest EC flew out like an honest to God flying squirrel, wrapped her body about the pile, and we dragged her back. Brother flight made it through their door just as the camera finished rotating. Stupid story, but we still laugh about it years later.

What might establish the peripheries of this question are books that keep intact a belief system, or way of life, a secret or not codification of a state of well being? A Bible? Alcoholics Anonymous? Probably that is the first place to visit, the religious book, though offhand it seems that the travel of this sort of book wouldn transcend one owner. The Bible and company are enormously popular books and have been printed no doubt in terms of billions of copies, so they have a much better chance of being the leader of the category by sheer numerical possibility. On the other hand some of them were tremendously popular but relatively short lived, like the "Little Red Book", which was carried by most Chinese for decades, though I doubt that the work as an inherited object was inter generational.

Nothing seemed to happen in this investigatory realm until suddenly in the summer of 2008, when it was conveniently decided that a lone microbiologist, Bruce Ivins, was most likely the perpetrator of these anthrax attacks and   when Ivins, in a most convenient way, committed suicide, it seems   the case seemed to be satisfactorily closed.

I had thought for sure that the German lineage would have been more likely. (It might actually be, but German genealogy I find harder to trace at a certain point. Not sure if it's because I don't speak German or if it's because Germany wasn't Germany until 1871.).

Aromatherapy has many other benefits, too. Inhaling the appropriate fragrance can reduce stress, lift a depression, hasten a good night's sleep, soothe your soul, or give you more energy. Aromatherapy is already helping office workers stay alert while doing repetitive mental tasks. That's because essential oils, the compounds responsible for a plant's fragrance, offer a multitude of healing benefits in addition to their individual scents. A pungent liniment such as Chinese Tiger Balm, for instance, eases aches and pains. And the latest fragrant shampoos and body oils will improve the health of your complexion and hair while at the same time inducing a particular mood.

While no one actually needs an automatic card shuffler there are times when these machines come in handy. If you play cards as a family then chances are there are one or two members that may have significant trouble shuffling the cards when their turn comes. Using a card shuffler when playing with these people means a good shuffle without calling attention to whatever difficulty they are having. A card shuffler can also eliminate those dealing arguments over those serious poker games as well.

Perhaps this is why, when I was fired by my college a few years back, students (past, present and future) rallied together to create a FB page to figure out how to save my job. Came up with organizing ideas  like letter writing campaigns to board members and taking over the president office hours to talk about the issue  and wrote testimonials to me and actually turned the process around. Students, no, not students, these human beings also made me extremely grateful to have them in my life, not because I got my job back, but because I learned that the job was rather beside the point..

Two days ago, I got a deep tissue massage that I suppose went a little deeper than I usually go. I'm having some new side effects that I have never experienced before and would very much like to get rid of. First, I have the muscle soreness (not unusual) but also I have extreme skin sensitivity throughout my body, even on areas that were not massaged. When my dog brushed by me, the sensation of his fur against my skin made me jump like three feet in the air. I'm struggling to fall asleep because the sensation of the blanket covers Ng me is so distractingly intense. After the massage, I felt fuzzy, almost like the end of a high. This feeling has continued for two days, accompanied by headaches. I began suffering fatigue after the massage but the feeling has not gone away. I spent the majority of yesterday trying to sleep off these side effects to no avail. It basically feels like the flu without any of the respiratory components. I don't believe I'm getting sick from unrelated virus, it's a noticeably different feeling than that.
