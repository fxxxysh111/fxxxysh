It is a wonderful thing to open these dis associated image combinatorics to free interpretation, each viewer finding their own meaning in a mysteriously composed components.This of course was an unintentional artifact of the artist and engraver. Images like this confusing, anti intuitive, misleading weren constructed to be so (at least not in a major and determined way) until the arrival of the Dadaists in the 20th century. This was a short lived, proto archaic (?) group with a confusing history, a tumultuous existence, and a short and sure ending.

The most obvious answer is that slots have an everyman appeal. Unlike poker, which often requires years of study and dedication, slots have no complicated rules to learn or skills to acquire. Most people who join online casinos are looking for some fun, without too much brain tax. Slots fit the bill perfectly, and players can even multitask while spinning the reels. Everyone is busy these days, and slots present an ideal opportunity to relax, have a fun game and possibly win some prizes, without having to give your undivided attention to the screen. Slot games even fit into a busy working day, taking the boredom out of long commutes.

It wasn't until 2038 when we knew for sure that babies born in Antarctica were immortal. The first of them was born in 1978 and by then he had turned 60 though he literally looked not a day over 25. We had been doing tests on him for over 6 years at that point wondering how it was possible that he hadn't shown any signs of aging. We started testing the original 11 and discovered that the continent had some sort of interference in telomere decay for those born there thus halting aging completely after puberty. We did our best to keep this classified and held them prisoner. It wasn't right but we did what we had to do for the good of mankind. It wasn't long, however, that word got out and humanity migrated in groves to the former least populated continent to give their children everlasting life. War broke out between every nation as everyone wanted control of it to have an unstoppable army. Shortly after the war broke out. When the first nukes from Russia hit Spain, the world erupted into anarchy. Soon every country with the capabilities to do so, launched their own nukes in retaliation at each other. After that it was everyone for themselves. Those of us who survived and were fortunate enough to not be engulfed in nuclear radiation started forming into groups that fought for limited supplies and territories. Some who were daring enough journeyed thousands of miles to make it to Antarctica so their children could have a better life.

Either way, Lara was already an experienced adventurer in the classic games, right? In the first of the new games it was clear that is was her first adventure   in spite of her naturally incredible agility, combat prowess, and familiarity with bows and a variety of firearms.

Right at 7AM we got underway for Lap 1. Within the first kilometer, I dropped everyone. The plan was to hit the first lap hard before the sun rose. I wanted to capitalize on the perfect temperatures before the day started heating up. The first lap was uneventful. I was loving it. It felt great to finally stretch the legs after a week of minimal running. The hamstring felt fine! I was carrying my handheld and some gel, so I didn't spend any time at the aid stations as I ran through. The desert was also an interesting change in scenery, and I tried to take it all in as I ran. The course featured a clockwise counterclockwise clockwise loop direction, so I knew I had the opportunity to see how much of a lead I had on the other runners each lap. I came into the finish and immediately turned around, eager to keep that gap I had created. My first lap time was 1:12:24. A minute or two faster than the initial plan, but that was no sweat. Things were working for me.

The current information suggests a valuable role in joint manipulation in preserving the joint lubrication abilities and enhancing the removal of waste products in these vulnerable, avascular structures.In 1995, Buckwalter, MD (1) concluded based on his research, that intervertebral discs undergo age related degenerative changes.The most important cause appears to be declining joint nutrition and lubrication of the central disc, which allows an accumulation of cell waste products, degraded matrix molecules, and a fall in pH.He noted that the factors, which may increase the rate and severity of declining changes byaltering joint nutrition include: immobilization, sustained disc loading, vibration and spinal deformity.Buckwalter findings echo the conclusions of a 1993 paper by Holm, PhD (2) in which a summary illustration noted that discs have an uneven distribution of the few cells they contain and that these cells are subjected to much metabolic variation.This makes discs/joints susceptible to lubrication/nutrition deficiencies.What we know today is that movement of the vertebral motion segments is essential for joint health and lubrication.
