Especially in this case. Their net code is so fucking busted that their servers can filter out what are very obviously duplicate requests, and it the players fault? It hard to explain to someone who isnt into software exactly how egregious that is. If that was brought to me and called production code, the idiots who brought it to me would be doing nothing but cleaning up other people code for the rest of their time working in that codebase. Apparently at Bethesda they get leadership positions.

The reason for the disappearance was largely, though not entirely, political. Sex therapy had a sketchy reputation when it began. Throw in the notion of using a substitute sexual partner, with its heavy payload of sniggering and the foggy legality of paying for sex, and the fledging field was at risk of being regarded as more whoopee than therapy.

Exercise Balls (or Swiss Balls) have been used by physical therapists since the 1960s and have become more popular throughout the fitness industry over the last 5 10 years. Now they are so popular that they can be found at most large discount retailers. With the constant onslaught of advertising for the next great piece of exercise equipment, it can be difficult to determine what is worth buying and what will be added to your collection of unused equipment. Even though exercise balls are one of the most inexpensive pieces of equipment (typically around $15 to $30), I can confidently tell you that exercise balls are among the most useful pieces of exercise equipment you can buy. Exercise balls are so versatile that there is no way to cover all the ways they can be used in one article. As a result, I will focus on the basics: the benefits of exercise balls, how to buy an exercise ball and some different ways to use them.

Depends entirely on who is giving the punishment. For many people, myself included, it was absolutely the primary method of punishment.

The feds tell us that households will be net beneficiaries on average because the incentives they get back each year at tax time will exceed the extra fuel charges they begin paying in April. Large businesses will pay a little more under a complex, separately administered output based pricing system (OBPS), but only after receiving exemptions on about 80 per cent on the fuels they currently use.

C'tait l'aprs midi, il faisait beau et je compulsais "Par del bien et mal" en dsordre, puis au fur et  mesure de ma dcouverte, avec application. J'tais boulevers par ce que je lisais et avais l'impression que le sol tremblait sous mes pieds. Le texte de Nietzsche rsonnait en moi comme si je l'attendais depuis toujours. Il y a des coups de foudre dans la pense comme en amour. Je ne dcouvrais pas Nietzsche, c'tait la lecture de Nietzsche qui m'arraisonnait  moi mme,  travers lui je me comprenais mieux. Je n'ai jamais prouv un tel choc en lisant un livre de philosophie et, de fait, Nietzsche n'est pas un philosophe mais un psychologue et un pote, et c'est sa psychologie, comme sa posie, qui m'allaient droit au cur. Pourquoi ce choc et qu'est ce qui en est rsult dans ma vie, c'est ce que je vais tenter d'lucider ici.

To examine the differences in risk taking between teens and adults, researchers studied 33 healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17, along with 30 normal adults aged 30 to 50. They all engaged in a gambling game, in which they could take a definite $5 reward or choose between the possibility of getting a much larger payout or nothing at all. The payout was based on whether there was a greater number of red or blue poker chips in a stack of 100; to vary the ambiguity, larger or smaller portions of the stacks were hidden from view..

Kvothe conclusions are spurious and poorly grounded in logic, but the narrative handwaves these leaps very quickly so that you don see them. At the same time, we get hints that all is not as it seems in Kvothe view of the world. The kind Encanis vs the harsh priests.

In the last 24 hours I come across two antiquarian outlooks on the longevity of the world coal supply after not having seen hardly anything of the sort written in the 19th century. (The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy".

Fischer (1882 1953 (?)) approached the National Socialists and Hitler as early as 1931, at which point he seems to begin his rapid and lofty ascent to the heights of Nazi banking. He simply put them through and thus made in the view of historian Kopper contribution to the destruction of the economic existences of Jewish citizens and societies. It is was assumed that by 1953 with no word whatsoever regarding him Fischer was presumed to be dead.

You'll make $5 and hour in daytime, which is 40$ to pay for your drinks at night, but you are beating the micro tables online, so you sure as hell can beat the $1/$2 live game and now you have a good shot to try and make yourself 100BB a night (200$). You aren't currently a winning player at 2NL. The gap to achieve this is going to take you hundreds (if you are exceptionally talented/have perfect study habits) of hours and more likely thousands of hours. If you put that effort into many other endeavors it's likely you'll make far more than your desired 24k/year. If you aren't in the US it's possible this isn't true but the games are also going to be much more difficult and require an even higher skill to achieve your goals.

Flop and turn bets are good   could go a little bigger on the turn given that lots of your opponents hands will be pair+gutshot or pair+flush draw and you can size up with your more polarized range (flush draw OR TPTK+) and abuse that. River bet can be on the smaller side but definitely bigger than $50, more like 1/3 1/2 pot. Can be exportability sized bigger as well but I like betting smaller so you can continue to bet your TPTK+..

A judge can get a reprimand, which doesn do much except allow for him to be blasted in the press.

Yeah it looks like it is prescription only in the US, but almost every other country it is an OTC medication. I find it really odd but a few times when I looked into common American medications, I find these weird substitutes, often with abuse potential. Pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine, and alprazolam, are the first few that come to mind.

You have to understand that cancer itself is your growth derangement. It's not a metabolic imbalance that can be fixed by adding or subtracting.

No, they just decided that victims of this scheme are allowed to sue after the fact.

Sony has the largest player base currently and I'm sure they would like to keep that.

Outside of trauma, the body maintained a wonderfully effective selective barrier in the small intestine, one that allowed nutrients to enter, but kept out metabolic wastes and microbial toxins rampant in the intestines. Since the 50s and 60s, antibiotic use has been frantically prescribed for every infection and inflammation, particularly pediatric ear infection, bronchitis, and sore throat.It is sadly ironic that most of these infections are viral in nature, and not only are the antibiotics damaging, but they are ultimately unnecessary.

Higher child/caregiver ratios. Frequent training, tuition reimbursement for employees, much higher pay than in the civilian world so that there was little employee turnover, a ton of oversight.

Perhaps it is the result of economic collapse and military quagmires? the same forces that push Tea Party members to rage against big government push journalists to express anxiety about collapsing sexual borders? Olympic athletes can be both amazingly strong and disciplined and gay men, then how do we mark gay men as "weak" and straight men as "strong"? soldiers are allowed to have desires for humans rather than for the "opposite" sex, then how can masculinity and femininity be upheld? all, when the homosexual was invented, s/he was invented as a gender invert  a feminine man or masculine woman. If a soldier can be a masculine man in love with another masculine man? entire sex/gender system, what queer theorist Judith Butler calls "the heterosexual matrix," collapses. What if hot starlets have hot female lovers? can they be "sexy" and "feminine" and also lesbian if lesbians are imagined as masculine to keep straight women girlie?.

Your question fits into a very specific stereotype of a certain type of losing player who blames their losses on the "bad play" of others, ignoring that failing to account for others "bad play" is in itself bad play.

I recommend this for several reasons. 1) If you have a working dog like a red heeler, they like to look to you for work. So it's part of the job for them. 2) Eventually this exercise gets you to a place where if the dog is unsure of what to do, they look to you for direction. This is great and you want this because it can help redirect unwanted behavior by having the dog ask you to redirect them. 3) This is a foster dog and you want to set them up for success. Basic obedience stuff is 90% focusing on the handler. Eye contact is the easiest way to teach this. 4) With a dog who is looking to you a lot, you can teach them so. Much. Other. Stuff. I mean like you can zoom through 101 Dog Tricks book. Why do you want this? Cuz this dog is a working dog and new tricks for 10 minutes a day will tire them out in a way that a 30 minute walk just won't. 5) Bonus, if you teach them lots of new tricks, even if they don't remember them with their new owner, what you've done is taught the dog that learning from their handler is excellent fun and rewards tasty treats. You've fostered a dog who now enjoys learning, and that's always huge behaviorally.

I once read an article about how most people fit into one of two social "cultures." There the "offer culture" of people who wait for something to be offered and would never dream of asking for something that wasn already on offer, because they see that as being rude.

I'm talking super basic features like flac support or hot cue buttons (something that exists on all levels of gear elsewhere) or platter tension adjustment.It's fine because that's how they do things, but the backlash is starting to grow and the competition is not saddling themselves with the artificial limitations (because they can't afford to do what pioneer does).But there will be always an army of fanboys defending their decisions just because it's pioneer, or discounting the competition because it's not   even if they readily acknowledge that the other gear is better.Currently, people are bitching that pioneer isn't listening to their customers and bitching about the price being too high, yet those same people refuse to buy anything else.

The objectivity of collage   taking an image from outside and putting it, whole and entire, in the fictional space of the painting   appealed to Magritte, because he liked standardized images; it was their encounter and rearrangement that created the magic, more than the things themselves. "Our secret desire," he remarked, "is for a change in the order of things, and it is appeased by the vision of a new order . . . The fate of an object in which we had no interest suddenly begins to disturb us." Turned balusters, game pieces, the little round horse bells known as grelots, cut out paper doilies, wood paneling, views through a window, fire, a birdcage, a rifle, a tuba, a pipe, loaves of bread, a naked woman: there wasn't much in Magritte's repertoire of images that couldn't have been seen by an ordinary Belgian clerk in the course of an ordinary day.

As someone who worked at the Big4 it's not magic or an art. It's following applicable tax law and getting your client to pay the least they are legally obligated to.

Those forwards, with few exceptions, were all local men, playing for the love of the game, but in the two teams were highly paid coaches, apparently content to allow the forwards close the game up and battle it out in the worst type of spectacle from the supporters point of view. To obtain "name" players country clubs are required to pay huge transfer fees to city clubs, plus a fee to the player which generally ranges from 300 to 1000. Raising this money falls to the lot of "a few" hard workers in all clubs, whereas the outlay of such big fees might well be expected to come back to the clubs in increased gates through brighter and better football.

We "stem the tide" by putting into place functional immigration policies so that there are options for people who wish to enter this country to do so legally instead of the byzantine and arbitrary system we have right now. When there are no legal avenues to get what they want, people will resort to illegal ones. There is no stopping this. No amount of enforcement or punishment will have any effect, but it will cost us a tremendous amount of money. Just look at how effective drug prohibition has been   we can even keep drugs out of prisons. You think it is possible to effectively block a thousands mile long border without crippling business and tourism travel, a vital part of the economy?

Every family is different, as are their values. Lindsay mother probably placed much of her daughter value (along with her own) in their ability to function as a homemaker and wife. In some family dynamics, the entire end game for a daughter is to find a good man (the marrying type) and to settle down and take care of the house and children. Such a dynamic may seem archaic and patriarchal to you and me, but its many girls reality. This is evident in Lindsay mother teaching her how to cook, her mentioning their "little ones" and Lindsay frustration with the roast in the season 5 premiere. Lindsay was probably never given the idea that she could or should function as anything more than a housewife. Her marrying Dean immediately after graduating high school probably jumpstarts the process Lindsay and her family had been planning for her all along.

Playing at the casino tournaments the strategy may be different from the common gambling. When gambling, for the most players the main thing is not to lose. The gambler plays discreetly, tries his best efforts to prolong the pleasure and not to lose. The main thing about the tournaments is to hit the prize pool. It makes no sense to hang around the initial sum, as you would never come into the prize winners. It's all the same whether you'll lose your money or keep it   anyway you will pay for entry. So, the winning formula of tournament games is "Sink or swim". You will have to stake high and take risks. There are two main approaches in tournament games, one of them is called conservative and the other one is referred to as aggressive.

HR creates inefficiencies by involving themselves in a decision making process that they offer no value to and which they have no power in.

With the holidays come a lot of feasting and buying huge amounts of food. If you involved with food prep and cooking, you can try and buy things in minimal packaging. Plan well to avoid wastage.

Slowed to a stop but couldn get my engine to turn over. Maybe the Big Guy was saving me from one of those bears recently spotted on trail, or maybe it just one of those days. As I am in the middle of nowhere, it is pouring rain, pitch dark, and 42 degrees outside I be lying if I said I wasn crazy bummed about a missed adventure and whatever is going on with my car/how much it might cost to be fixed. But I am at least grateful for all the day hiking I did this week, for peanut butter M for warm layers, and you better believe I grateful for AAA. Also, the day before yesterday a very difficult and closed off non verbal autistic kiddo held my hand as I walked him out of the treatment room. That trumps this misadventure forever.
