Budyko model experiments have been confirmed by Hoffmans field research.

Une question quand mme : les rues et les trottoirs taient ils vraiment couverts de paille et de terre vers 1900 ? Certes les services de voirie taient plus modestement quips, mais Paris, et prcisment ce quartier, ne cachait pas un grand potager.

I think I just have really high expectations for what a college coach should have accomplished overwhelming accomplishments like what Stevens did at Butler to give me confidence that he can succeed at the NBA level.

What amazing about these? What people mistake for "amazing" is that the demographics are homogenous and make them comfortable. The likelihood of some amazing teaching working there is only slightly higher than other places. It not as if they have some super magical screening process that makes it so they only hire geniuses.

In any event, there are such a limited number of teachers that exceptional that there simply aren enough of them to staff all the rich district schools in the United States.

Here's something that isn't always immediately obvious. Think about the ratio of your required bet to stay in versus the money in the pot. Compare that to your odds of winning the hand. If the pot has 10 bucks and it's two dollars to you, you should stay in if you think you have even a 21% chance of winning. Even though you'll lose 4 out of 5, over the long haul, you should come out ahead this way.

Chaffetz, a freshman member of Congress from Utah, told Politico that it was time for Republicans to do more than "take pot shots at ACORN." And although Chaffetz realizes his opposition to GOP leadership might hurt him, he is taking a stand against more war in Afghanistan. Of course Chaffetz is notoriously cheap, choosing to sleep on a cot in his office rather than rent a DC apartment because of the country $10TRILLION debt, but he is also a "pristine conservative" and represents some important elements in the Republicans "big tent"  fiscal conservatism, populism, and even charisma (His appearance on the Colbert Report was hilarious).

It will be kind of counter productive to the waiting list you signed up for.

At 1st I believed him and said "Take them to Small Claims Court." Then I saw other evidence, another user posted a snapshot of texts from the Car Dealer stating the guy did NOT follow through with producing pay stubs proving his income to secure financing so they sold the vehicle (after holding it for an unspecified amount of time) and refunded him 1/2 the deposit. The original poster refused to answer 2 questions about how long the Dealer did hold the car waiting for him to provide proof of income. I posted it sounded like he breached the verbal contract by not providing proof of income to make financing happen and he blocked me from his post! How dare I state a valid argument!

There no indication in the LAOP the school actually bans VPN use, they just want to verify it user initiated. Colleges vary wildly on network AUP terms, and the colleges I attended specifically stated they do not monitor the content of student Internet usage. The LAOP likely uses their VPN service even when connecting to school hosted services, meaning it appears that a foreign entity is connecting to school systems with the LAOP student credentials and that a definite problem if it not the student doing that..

It's a very complicated topic; but IMO the attitudes of executives in the US before the war ultimately meant their factories were appropriated by the Nazis. I think Henry Ford should be viewed much more negatively than he is now, and perhaps Ford of Europe (and by proxy Ford itself) should have paid far more for its complicity in manufacturing German arms. But I'm just a layman.

Many times when we just wake up with a stiff neck after one night of sleeping in the wrong position it is just that our muscles have gotten stiff and we need to get some blood flow to them in order to alleviate the pain. If you find yourself in the position that you wake up with a stiff neck, the worst thing you can do is not move it; however, it is equally as bad to try and jam your neck into certain positions that it does not want to go.

Everybody in prison needs books and moreso, psychotherapy.

One manual method was taught long ago by Masters and Johnson. Just before the man was about to ejaculate, they told women, place the tripod formed by your thumb, index and middle fingers around the tip of his penis, and squeeze. (You can also squeeze around the base of the penis.) When he orgasms, he will be unable to ejaculate. Keep squeezing until the rolling thunder passes and his body relaxes. Then slowly release the pressure. While he will lose some or most of his erection, he can recover it quickly and start again.

If you have 65 cats, and are poor, this skill wouldn be hard to train by accident at all. Keep in mind cats are quite smart. So when one of the cats brings something besides a dead animal that this lady actually finds useful to her, she will praise that cat, maybe not thinking of the items origin. And she rewards that cat with a bit more affection and extra food. The 64 other cats learn from that behavior, and then go out and repeat the behavior that got that one cat extra love and food. It would be harder to train one cat to do this than an army of them. Because in the army of cats, one of them at least is already a bad hunter and just brings back random things it picks up. That would be all that you need to start this off.

One of the most interesting things about playing poker was learning the discipline of not confusing the right decision with the individual outcome of any single hand, but that's what a lot of poker players do. If they win a hand, they assume they made the right bet, and if they lose a hand, they often assume they made the wrong bet. With the coin that lands on heads a third of the time, this would be like seeing the coin land on heads once (the individual outcome) and changing your behavior so you bet on heads, when the mathematically correct thing to do is to always bet on tails no matter what happened in the previous coin flip (the right decision)..

I work in a hospital, make it very clear to hospital staff that FDH is the ONLY one to come in the labor room and that your mom may try. They can be ready (with a warning to security just in case it gets ugly). We have had instances late at night were someone came in to start yelling and security said they couldn go in unless it was supervised. The person left.

Plus many places appreciate being prepared for something that never happens rather than dealing with something they weren ready for.

Whilst we struggle with letting go at times, our natural reserves of positive plenty may wane and we may feel stagnant for a time.

 1 point  submitted 2 months agoHey I work for EE! Our temp ratings correspond most closely to EN lower limit temperature, which is commonly used among men and unisex sleeping bags, whereas other brands may use the higher EN comfort temperature, commonly used for so called women bags. Both temperatures are distinct from survival temperature, which is where risk for frostbite begins so the survival temperature is just what it sounds like, only for emergencies. Comfort temperature tends to be 10 15 degrees higher than limit temperature, so if you feel like you sleep cold, choose a temp rating with that in mind. TL;DR You can guesstimate the comfort rating of the system by adding 10 15 degrees to the lower limit rating you see. Feel free to reach out if you have questions! 3 points  submitted 3 months agoHi there! We prefer no liner here at the CS team (we much prefer base layers to keep the bag clean and allow you to shift/use the quilt venting to its maximum ability). I also would highly recommend stepping down in temp, as a couple people have already mentioned, 3oz of down in a shell you already are carrying is by far the most efficient insulation/additional warmth you can add to your kit.If you were to sleep cold in your 30 degree and add a superlight down jacket to buffer out the temps for you, you immediately would be carrying 6oz minimum vs 3oz of down and the down would do more to keep you warm than the jacket would, so I think almost always just stepping a temperature down is the more efficient and versatile choice if you on the fence.

Your optimal open size is gonna depend heavily on the table you at. If it full of nitty players that will fold unless they have a top 15%+ hand, then I would use a min raise size to exploit this and steal their blinds more frequently.

In all likelihood, fixed and variable O costs also go up significantly as capacity factor decreases, albeit not linearly. That is because decreasing the load of the nuclear plant or even turning it down to zero does not allow proportional recovery of these costs. There would also be additional actual and opportunity costs associated with ramping and power cycling. In the end I think you would be looking at levelized costs of over $250/MWh under this scenario.
