In 06 we got tickets to game 5. I was a freshman in HS and it was during finals of my first semester; a lot of my teachers weren't onboard with me missing finals for baseball but I had worked it out nevertheless. Game 4 gets rained out so I end up going to school on the date on our tickets because everything will be pushed back a day because of the rainout.

We find out the game is still on and I get pulled out of class in the middle of finals so we can drive the 4 hours to STL to make the game. Cards obviously win both and we got screwed out of seeing the clincher.

Our research suggests that it can boost performance, even for traders in hypercompetitive markets or startups with little upfront advantage.

Now I didn struggle on this myself, but I know many did. This does not need to be in a row. So go to each one of these locations and beat the first opponet. Strawberry, Valentine, Van Horn Trading Post. (If the opponent is not their for you in Valentine, Sleep to make the in game night then get near the location and restart your game). If you would like to complete all 4 of the challengers, I suggest wrighting the harder button combos on a notepad, and don even look at the screen.

Don't tell people it's "impossible" for you to move out. Just say you don't want to. You've got kids convinced they can't move out of their parents house before they've even started high school, based on nothing but popular rhetoric. 
The only thing i can say is that i know exactly how you feel. and i hesitate to call it PPD because it started before birth. because here i am 7 years later, still feeling exactly the same. and i know that not what you were hoping to hear, that you were hoping something would click, soon, and you feel the way all the other mothers feel. maybe that happen for you, but that not my reality. all i can comfort you with is the knowledge that i am in your exact shoes, have been for 7 years, that i don judge you in the slightest for any of the things you felt or done. i with you, i understand.

Mark Twain uses finger prints as essential legal elements (as well as comic relief) in his novels on the Mississippi and Wilson no doubt inspired by Francis Galton pioneering work on the subject (Finger Prints, published in 1892).

I try to take an hour to read a book every day. I'm pretty active as a stay at home mom and dog trainer with a huge garden in the summer and a wood stove in the winter but it's really important for me as an introvert with a love of books to have that little sanctuary for myself every day if possible..

They're flawed in a natural human way to be based in reality. Because of this basis things naturally aren't as off the wall to begin with.I see this as a comparison between Amnesty being the early seasons in Supernatural before things jump the shark with the angel stuff and like Adventure Time where nothing has to make sense you accept the gag.Personally I enjoyed Balance more because it seemed more unpredictable. 
But because these people were not just kicking for Christ, but they were clearly very much a part of a larger military sponsored mission to convert soldiers to fundamentalist Christianity.. 
It's a much needed break as Pacquiao hurried back to the Philippines after his fight and postponed his holiday. His home town was hit rigorously by storms and floods. His Mother was also taken to hospital after fainting at the news of her sons loss.

It's funny how people take Pride week so seriously, yet all they are doing is getting wasted for a week straight (at least here in NYC). Of all the people I've seen and known to get incredibly riled up over it and serious about attending, those are the ones who don't do anything other than party. They're not working for LGBT organizations, they're not helping to raise awareness or seek donations for any kind of charity, they aren't performing or speaking in public or helping organize it in some way, etc.

First, see a neurologist. You really need to get at the root of your headaches. I suggest you prepare to go into what I call "survival mode". Our society doesn deal well with people who are ill. You may have to use services that you never thought you use. Things like food banks, food aid, Medicaid. Contact your state and county to see if they can help. Get applied for Medicare and Social Security Disability. Cut down your expenses to the bare minimum. You are not a failure. You did not cause yourself to become ill. Good luck.

This was at a time when retail prices were officially unchanged, leading to huge increases in consumption.Compounded onto this was the large scale extensive growth in the land scheme, where huge amounts of soviet investment were put into fertilizing and preparing the Kazakhstan region for cultivation. These types of projects were common throughout the soviet era, as for planned economies an extensive growth in the inputs of production is much easier to accomplish then the intensive growth with existing inputs as we see in modern economies.The early surge in farm production encouraged him to talk in 1957 of overtaking American per capita meat production by 1975, something to which the Soviet Union never came close.

Scalia was passionate about the death penalty. He wrote for the court when in 1989 it allowed states to use capital punishment for killers who were 16 or 17 when they committed their crimes.

Ultimately EAs loss on those few bucks per sale wouldn matter since you have so many more people paying for shit..

Yeah, this is a good observation. I don think that the sort of "emotionless girl" archetype 2B channels really exists in English speaking media, or at least not in the same way that it does in Japanese. And I don think I seen a single dub that plays the trope completely straight that manages to really make it work   usually the character just ends up sounding flat. It just another dilemma of translation/localization that has to be worked through. I also think non Japanese speakers sometimes put Japanese voice acting on a pedestal because aside from on the most general terms they have no real way of knowing what sounds "good" and what doesn said, I really love Kira performance as 2B and I think she does a great job conveying her character!

I was going for a PR on my bench and asked a guy to spot me. I faltered about halfway up but was clearly pushing through. I yelled DONT TOUCH IT but he did anyway and grabbed the bar. And then proceeded to tell me I should lower my weight and work my way up. Or the time I was warming up for squats with 135 and when I went to do my first rep a guy asked me if I was sure I could squat that much. How the fuck do I make this stop??

They have this at Woodlands Montessori preschool in Central up on Caine road. I take my son there twice a week. On the other side of this is a mock bank with cash in the teller, credit cards, and other things. It is actually a pretty cool play area. They have a whole town in various cubicles. They have a mock Firestation, Police station, restaurant, grocery store, and dolly nursery, and a full playhouse in the back room. When kids get old enough the bank and police stuff is perfect for cops and robbers. I think this board is more as a joke for parents, Never seen a kid ever really look at it. Parents see this on tours, and also like me you an adult is required when the toddlers are just starting out.

This is a long story of its own but to put it simply, North Korea refused low level talks because it sensed that they could get a better deal by one on one talking with Trump himself. The US chief nuclear negotiator Stephen Biegun was only able to begin talks with NK this year after months of NK reluctance   and the resulting prep time was very short. Thus its highly likely that the (relatively) small details such as the formal end to the Korean war, normalising relations, joint excavations etc. were sorted out while the big questions (denuke/sanctions relief) were left blank for the two leaders to figure out at Hanoi. Much was at stake in this summit.

I completely agree. But I never claimed OP mounting discomfort is what made it sexist. The sexism was in the customer pattern of behaviors. Alone, his comment may not have been attributable to sexism. But in this instance   where he is very clearly behaving a specific way towards this server because she is female   it is part of a whole. I can say with certainty but am willing to bet if it had been a male server, he wouldn have quizzed him even if he responded with a pause. But yes, it is possible he would have.

I 100% believe his explanation, but it's helpful to see another guy articulate the same sentiment as my boyfriend about how he views porn. Thanks for commenting dude.

If this is your first stats book, I recommend thinking of things like this until you eventually get a formal explanation for random variables. The trick is to realize when you thinking about functions on the random variable, and functions on the data. Also note books are notoriously bad about mixing up capitals and lower cases for the sake of brevity, but it should be clear if you talking about aspects of your random variable, or functions on your data.

That a much more nuanced argument since soy and other plant based protein sources, contrary to popular vegan belief, are not "complete sources of protein" (meat is), as they lack two of the nine amino acids, specifically methionine and lysine. So soy alone would not suffice, and more sources of plant protein would need to be consumed to make up for the lack of amino acids one finds in protein rich meat.

You'd have to be delusional to anticipate that something like this would happen when you embark on a project like this. I came in with no expectations and I didn't know anything about poker and had zero background. I didn't grasp what a complex game it was when I got into it.

As hard as you work, I don't think it was a reasonable expectation I would win a tournament, let alone a major title. It was a whirlwind journey, but a very gratifying one. I'm incredibly grateful.

My first guess is the scammer wants the fraudulent transactions to look like they came from a variety of sources, possibly because they're skimmed cards and to figure out whether the card is still active.

Do you know anyone that has to check the weather channel before they play a little Texas Hold'em? Well that's us and the reason we play outside on the deck with our Custom Poker Table is there just isn't enough room in the house for everyone to be comfortable when they come over.

But 2700+ players are probably less likely to want to essentially retire from their active competitive careers to work as a coach/principal second on a permanent basis.

The fishbowl girls were all 2,000 baht apiece, while there were a couple of sideliners available for 2,300. The mamasan said there were upstairs for 3,000 3,300 but the selection downstairs was good enough, and a decent price. I went for a fishbowl girl. All in for 2,000 is below the going rate, and it looked to be a nice place. Drinks were extra. I ordered water at 40 baht, while the girl ordered a watermelon smoothie which came to 120 baht!

Is it wrong? No. But it can escalate into somewhat of a problem. And if the two you love know each other and know you love them both, they can start battling each other out, making to simplest of gestures into a big argument.

Their faith in these products have made other superstitious as well. However, the final result is increase in sales in Shadow Spinners Chip And A Chair Poker Card Protector.

And you entirely ignored the last portion of my comment. Please, explain to me how seeing someone, having them remind you of your parents, or remind you of the progress we have made as a society, and it giving you a warm feeling inside is racist? If I see an old white woman, and she reminds me of my grandmother and makes me think "aww", is that also racist? What if I see an older black woman and she reminds me of my grandmother from my other side of the family? Am I allowed to feel warm inside then? Why or why not?.

EDIT: I'd just like to add another analysis of the issue here. We have a bunch of data being collected and being used. We don't understand the potential side effects of the pipelines the data flows through, or what deeper information is embedded in the sum of all of it. Your approach is "well nothing is going wrong now so let the data keep being collected." My approach is "well we don't really understand the full system here, so why don't we hold off on collecting data until we've properly thought through the necessary safeguards as a society."
What was said between you guys? Were you pretty specific on what you were gonna be doing? With her hearing you guys say that stuff to one another it may be time for you to explain to her that what you did is something adults do to express love to each other.

Jaja, er dwarrelden wel degelijk sneeuwvlokjes neer! De hoge bergen rondom Flagstaff hadden duidelijk besneeuwde toppen.

Even in light of this powerful evidence to the contrary, Cleveland was actually the least insane person in regard to executions in Erie County.
