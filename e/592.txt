I think preflop sizing is fine as well, but I do agree with JohnRusty that the post flop decisions here are not particularly significant to EV. It can be easy, especially in hindsight, to look at a high variance spot and think there was a crucial decision point that dictates a massive EV turning point.

Mathematically, it depends on the number of opponents. The probability that you will win goes down as the number of opponents goes up, because there are more ways for you to be beaten. Some hands play well against very few opponents, while others play well against many opponents. It all depends on the circumstances.

I'm sure you know the things I'm saying, but I want to stress it, because part of the problem that propels eating disorders and keeps people from recognizing them is this idea that there is some very strict set of standards for who does and doesn't need help. Fat people, skinny people, muscular people, vegetarians, non vegetarians, people who like to work out, people who hate working out, people who eat X or Y number of calories  they can all have eating disorders.

Typical mammalian hair consists of the shaft, protruding above the skin, and the root, which is sunk in a follicle, or pit, beneath the skin surface. Except for a few growing cells at the base of the root, the hair is dead tissue and is composed of keratin and related proteins. The hair follicle is a tube like pocket of the epidermis (see How Sunburns and Sun Tans Work) that encloses a small section of the dermis at its base. 
Preflop and flop play are fine, turn is kind of awkward with stack sizes (14 pot with 21 left), but I think a bet is still fine here as he has JJ a lot of the time here. I don mind a turn CR either with him feeling priced in to call JJ/combo draws.

There is a very good reason why Pacquiao and Roach get along so well. At some stage in his career Pacquiao must have admitted to himself that he was simply not a good enough boxer to become a legend. While most boxers would rather die than to have to admit to a shortcoming, Pacquiao is obviously able to put himself to question. He knows he needs Roach, and he respects him enough to listen to every word he says. How many times, while watching a fight, have you heard a trainer telling his fighter in the corner between rounds to double up his jab or keep his hands up or some such, only to find that in the following round the obviously good advice has fallen on deaf ears? The boxer goes right on doing what he should not be doing. More than once or twice I have been pleasantly surprised to hear Roach telling Pacquiao to do something different in the next round, and lo and behold, Pacquiao does exactly what he has been told. The best trainer in the world will achieve nothing with a boxer who wont listen to him. Roach is as a brilliant trainer as Pacquiao is a trainee.

That means that even if it wouldn effect the aesthetics of the building or neighborhood at all (it could even be designed to fake looking like a single family home from the exterior), developers aren allowed to build smaller units that would be more affordable. Explain why the government should be in the business of preventing private property owners from building whatever they want on their own property, especially when it presents zero changes to the aesthetic landscape of the neighborhood? Why would you support such anti capitalist and anti liberty policies? I will tell you why they have implemented these policies historically: to prevent poorer people who wouldn be able to afford the whole 3,200 sq ft home from living in their neighborhoods, which is literally the definition of discrimination..

Hallucinations like OP described typically come from severe alcohol withdrawal, which you can expect from heavy daily alcohol intake. Hitting the alcohol hard only on "most weekends" in all likelihood does not add up over time to produce hallucinations. When someone binge drinks on weekends they may have some shakiness and anxiety on Monday (I sure many of us have experienced this), but the brain typically has enough time to recalibrate throughout the week and never fully adjusts to relying on alcohol to maintain its neurochemical balance..

The study found that long term intake of CPP significantly suppressed visceral and liver fat accumulation that was induced by a high fat diet. CPP also helped the plasma glucose, insulin concentrations, and increased energy expenditure.Very interesting discoveries were made.

Cost of Care for Common Back Pain Conditions initiated with DC versus MD/DO as First Physician: Experience of one of Tennessee based General Health Insurer.There treatment was initiated by either a DC or MD demonstrates that treatment for an episode of Low Back Pain with a chiropractor results in lower costs for Low Back Pain care than episodes initiated by an medical doctor even after controlling for severity of the patients presenting complaints.This is a very large population of patients insured by one of the major insurers in the USA.The discussion section explains that by restricting access to chiropractic care, insurers may be paying more for management of Low Back Pain episodes than if they allowed unrestricted access to chiropractic care.This is a very significant finding which may cause health insurance companies to reappraise their policies concerning restricted access to chiropractic care.A retrospective claims analysis study (October 2004 thru Sept 2006) on Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee's intermediate large group fully insured population to determine if there are differences in the cost of Low Back Pain care, including visits medications (narcotic, analgesic, nonsteroidal, and muscle relaxants), when a Patient can choose Treatment with a MD or a DC.Coverage included unrestricted access to primary specialtyproviders of their choice unlimited services, exceptfor a 20 visit/yr year limit on physical therapy.There wereno differences in this population for co pays or deductiblesbased on provider type.Patients had open access to MDs DCs thru self referral without any limit to the number of visits or differences in co paysto these 2 provider types.Paid costs for episodes of Low Back Pain care initiated with a chiropractor were almost 40% less than episodes initiated with an MD.Even after risk adjusting each Patients costs (determining the severity of clinical presenting symptoms), episodes of care initiated with a DC were 20% lower than those initiated with an MD.Conclusions: Paidcosts for episodes of care initiated with a DC were almost40% less than episodes initiated with an MD. Even afterrisk adjusting each patient costs, episodesof care initiated w a DC are 20% less expensive thanepisodes initiated with an MD. Results suggest thatinsurance companies that restrict access to chiropractic carefor Low Back Pain may, inadvertently, be paying more for care thanthey would if they removed these restrictions.

Can you imagine a bunch of neocons and Howard Dean sitting around a table saying "US foreign policy should be motivated by the feminist goals of women liberation from patriarchy"? That about as believable as Sarah Palin being an expert on foreign policy.

At Bible college we got many people sent to our ministry school from Teen Challenge. Many people would "turn their life around" and then go into the ministry. At the end of my freshman year a guy left the school and admitted he was an atheist and only came there to get out of probation or something. Apparently going into the ministry can get them out of a lot of trouble if they are working with the court system and able to convince the judge and Teen Challenge that God is going to use them. Some of the guys from Teen Challenge were genuine but some were openly faking it and others were a bit predatorial and I feel like should not have been sent to live among sheltered and nieve pastor's kids. 11 points  submitted 9 days ago

"Data from the airplane's flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the airplane's right elevator was positioned full trailing edge down (TED) when the flight crew first powered up the airplane on the day of the accident and remained there throughout the accident sequence. An airplane performance study (based, in part, on FDR data) confirmed that the airplane did not respond in pitch when the captain pulled on the control column. Based on the study's comparison with a previous takeoff, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the airplane's lack of rotational response to the control column input did not become apparent to the captain in time for him to have stopped the airplane on the runway..

"In other words, our results suggest that in some individuals something goes wrong with the body's 'fight or flight' response or the body recovery from this response, and persistent pain results."The study assessed the role of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, a physiologic system of central importance to the body response to stressful events.The study evaluated whether the HPA axis influences musculoskeletal pain severity six weeks after motor vehicle collision (MVC) and sexual assault.Its findings revealed that variation in the gene encoding for the protein FKBP5, which plays an important role in regulating the HPA axis response to stress, was associated with a 20 percent higher risk of moderate to severe neck pain six weeks after a motor vehicle collision, as well as a greater extent of body pain.The same variant also predicted increased pain six weeks after sexual assault.now, if an someone comes to the emergency department after a car accident, we don have any interventions to prevent chronic pain from developing, McLean said.

Also he was doing repetitive movements for the whole 10 minutes like rubbing the exact same spot on my neck in the exact same up and down motion, and what i gathered from that is that his other hand was doing the same motion on his penis. It was a one handed massage and then I heard his zip. I just asking because i hate to do this to someone innocent but I feel violated and disgusting and I want to stop him.

For example, while a particular 8 year old and 14 year old may have similar abilities in maths, they will hugely different in their level of emotional maturity and behaviour regulation, meaning they have very different needs in terms of learning environment and teaching style. Similarly, while every individual matures at their own rate it still falls within a normal distribution, so the majority of kids do roughly match each other in terms of social, physical and cognitive development. So yes, while grouping students by age rather than ability does negatively affect student learning at the highest and lowest ends of the ability curve, it also maximizes developmental uniformity which positively affects their social development and their ability to bond with others (and together these things are equally if not more important than hard skill development).

The online poker world changed when payment processors froze player funds. My world changed as well, and in time my bankroll vanished. I distinctly remember sitting in my apartment in Orlando, wondering what I was going to do in life. Twenty five years old, and with $35 in my bank account, I had to watch what I was buying for dinner in fear of an overdraft fee. It was time to go back to college, get my degree, and get a job. First, though, I had to figure out how I was going to pay rent.

Sometimes you're just in the mood to relax and not worry about the volume button. Sometimes, you want a movie to be like a massage, transportive and relaxing. Well, look no further. I've culled the depths of Netflix to bring you five relaxing movies that are all very different. And, make no mistake, relaxing isn't synonymous with boring. These movies are simply dialogue driven. You won't find car chases or annoying swagger here. Think of these movies as the exact opposites of flicks like The Fast and the Furious or The Avengers.

For example: many people who sit at work tend to have tense and shortened muscles between the shoulder blades and around the ribcage at that height level and a bit below, which causes a sensation of your heart strongly beating against your chest and slight chest pains. It often manifests at night or when falling asleep and may even feel like arrythmia (even though it is medically not, obviously). So you get young healthy people anxiously going to their doctor, spending time and money for cardiology examinations and being told they completely fine even though they don feel that way at all (unless they have a very good doctor, some of them do know about it and recommend massage therapy and stretching excersises, but at least in my country it rare).

I (F, 22 at the time) was traveling through Italy alone. At the end of my trip I was staying at a hostel in Rome and decided to make a day trip to Naples and Pompei. When I told the hostel employees my plan they all freaked out and said I shouldn't go alone. Feeling confident, I shrugged off their worries and decided to make the trip anyway. Took the wrong train from Naples, realized my mistake and got off at some random stop in the outskirts of Naples, figuring there would be another train going back soon. Shortly after, local dudes started showing up on the opposite side of the tracks gesturing at me, muttering to each other. One dude even hopped down across the tracks and started pacing on my platform. I had a pocket knife in my coat that I was white knuckling the whole time. It felt like forever before the next train showed up. Thankfully nothing happened but I was basically in panic mode and couldn't wait to get the F out of Naples.

Then the donks that get beat out for their stacks buy right back in, and do it again. This is unlikely to happen when there is real money on the table.

Of course, neither are the people who do suffer from colds. Scientists examined the nasal cells of cold sufferers and found none of the damage you'd expect from a harmful viral infection.

The best thing to do would be to talk to the people who supply your cpap, they'll know what the protocol is and whether there's any way to help you out.

Like he beat the Nazis at poker to win the Jews' freedom or something? Actually, his cover was a boring desk job: working as a passport officer for the British Embassy in Berlin.

Foley was fully aware of the Jews' treatment by the Germans and didn't care for it one bit, so he began to forge passports and tweak visas so Jews could get to anywhere that wasn't under Hitler's rule. He even entered concentration camps to issue visas and travel documents to whoever he could save.

That night as I drove the hour and a half home from a rather difficult workout (for instance, we had to hold a push up position until we could cite the correct Bible versues by heart   a task I was ill prepared for), a thick fog rolled in. As I fiddled with the radio to try and find a station, the only thing that came in was an Evangelical preacher screaming about how Muslims want to kill us all.

A public health approach emphasises prevention, it certainly provides support for people who do have problems, but the emphasis should be on prevention. A good public health approach would first of all control the supply of the product, like drugs or alcohol, and it would also regulate or manage the demand for the product. So issues about where the machines are located, issues of access that I talked about before so the way you define the problem inevitably shapes the solutions that you develop to try and address the problems.

Few people can argue with the fact that effective money management is the single most important skill you can have in business and in poker. Seasoned poker players have learned that lesson long ago in their careers. Not every hand is worth playing; in fact most hands should be folded.
The awesome thing about poker is that no matter how good or bad you are there are always levels you can play at. For example, people who are new at the game might want to play at a lower level like 1$/2$ (or 1 cent/2 cent if you playing online).
