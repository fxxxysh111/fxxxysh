In America, factories switched over to making munitions early in the war because the military was buying those munitions at attractive prices. When the government winds down military procurement at the end of a world war, there are strong financial incentives for factories to switch back to peacetime production. In contrast, the heads of the design bureaus and munitions factories in the USSR didn have those same incentives, so they probably had to make the case to the higher ups that they should keep going.

It in the works. We been testing out a flair system to hopefully address this and other issues. News and maybe some other items will have more strict rules such as must be recent, non editorialized titles, link only (no self posts), etc so we can be more relaxed on other things. The non editorialzed titles is supposed to be applied to news only but we get reports on Wikipedia links etc for editorialized titles, etc so we like it to be clearer. It coming along with a rule revision that incorporates that so we waiting until both are complete. We likely implement them in the coming weeks after the Olympics.

Season 2 would have been the top. But 1) the French part isn't so great and 2) it's so damn upsetting! The first episode with Claire on her knees sobbing in direct contrast to how season 1 ended with happy news. The episode with Faith. And the last episode. my god. On my recent rewatch I found myself actively dreading it as it upsets me so much!

It was equally thrilling to see winemaker Genevieve Janssens in the city. The longtime Robert Mondavi employee, inexplicably attending her first Vancouver International Wine Festival, seemed the right person to close the four decade festival loop started by the Robert Mondavi family in 1979.

Het Rode Plein is toch n van de meest bijzondere plekken ter wereld die iedereen kent! Het was super om hier te zijn, maar we vonden het wel op zich niet zo indrukwekkend. Het is een langgerekte vlakte met kasseitjes en geverfde lijnen in alle kleuren, en dan omgeven door prachtige gebouwen. Maar die lijken ver van je af te staan; allicht door de grootte van het plein? We staken het plein over recht op de Basilius kathedraal af! Hier keek ik erg naar uit; het is echt een pracht van kleuren en uienbollen, onbeschrijflijk. Er staat trouwens een boom en een monument voor; en in ons geval ook een gigantisch podium voor n of ander concert dat het Rode Plein toch wel ontsierde tijdens onze trip. We wandelden verder berg afwaarts langs de Rode kremlin muren, met achter ons een eigenlijk nog mooier uitzicht op de kathedraal. Ik had bedacht "eventjes" rond het Kremlin te lopen. Maar pfff, dat was een flink blokje wandelen! Langs de rivier (helaas langs een hele drukke weg, wat zijn er grote wegen in het oude centrum!) zagen we een Stalin wolkenkrabber (je hebt er zeven in totaal, de "seven sisters"), en in de verte de gouden toren van de Christus Verlossers kathedraal. Achter de kremlin muren zagen we veel groen en gouden koepels, maar die moesten nog enkele daagjes wachten op een bezoekje van ons. Hoekje om, en zo kwamen we langs een zwaar bewaakte Kremlin ingang (Poetin's ingang?) en zo in de mooie Alexander tuinen.

In the United States, string cheese generally refers to snack sized servings of low moisture mozzarella. This form of string cheese is roughly cylindrical, about 6 inches (15 cm) long and less than 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter. The common term is a "cheese stick" which is cut and packaged, either individually or as a package of several lengths. The cheese used is nearly always a form of mozzarella, or a combination of mozzarella and cheddar. This type of string cheese gets its name because it can be eaten by pulling strips of cheese from the cylinder along its length and eating these strings.[21] It was invented in 1976 by Frank Baker and Jeb Cubbs.[22]

To really take this game one step further, I think it would be cool if the cops DIDNT know who the killer is, and they are really, actually trying to find that out. Say you have 8 "people", and you are on of them, "the killer"   but the cops don know who. If they accuse a random person, and are wrong, they lose. So their goal is to eliminate as many options as possible, maybe through using clues to show. This is problematic because it could cause a really anticlimactic game. Maybe it would be better if they slowly gained information (for instance, hair color, job, gender, etc   kind of like "guess who" haha). So when they get X number of clues, they get to reveal something about the killer that they have "found".
Honestly, and this is a thing that would pissed me off five years ago: time. In our early twenties my husband and I were happy with us and our dogs and our home, our goals and our adventures, and were sure we never wanted a baby. Then in our later twenties that opinion softened and at 29 I woke up one day and said "I been thinking for a long time and I think I might want to have a baby" and he said "oh thank god me too and I didn know how to tell you." Now we have a toddler and we have lost absolutely nothing (well, a few hundred dollars in baby gear and a bit of sleep) and gained a family member.

Depending on what you're opponent is holding, and what they have has already hit, your odds will change. In the above example if you're opponent is holding pocket AA, and has a made set, you still have a 27% chance to win if you go to the river. This is why open ended straight and flush draws are so powerful, and need to be played very aggressively.

I took my first job making $16/hr because it's really hard to get a break that also provides good experience and mentorship, plus is a good work culture. They've told me next year I'll get a much larger bump and switch to salary. If that's not true I'll look for something else with the experience. Either way I'm in a way better position than I was before I had a real job at all. A year goes by fast and it seems like once you have a solid year of good experience it's a lot easier to at least start getting interviews.

Seeing it from this perspective, most of these skirmishes last about 10 minutes in the game view as opposed to how we see it.

Masseurs who have gone to massage schools have had eroticism stripped away and one large school in New York has been instrumental in writing massage regulations. Such masseurs see Tantric work as unworthy of their "profession," besmirching the purity of their vanilla work. I was recently told by a young massage student that his school advises against using the term masseur in favor of Massage Therapist. In spite of all this, it's been my experience in several large cities that, after the second or third visit, when they're confident you're not a plant from the regulatory agency, they'll drop the draping and include the penis in the massage, not as a "happy ending," but as a significant part of a complete Tantric massage.

They were entertained at the New York, New York Hotel and Casino where they saw "Zumanity: Another Side of Cirque Du Soleil," which is described as a provocative cabaret style production with a Cirque Du Soleil twist. It is an adult themed 90 minute production with playful innuendo in the intimate "velvet lined" Zumanity Theatre with cabaret stools, love seats or duo sofas that could have been ideal for the sumos. Incidentally, I particularly enjoyed the 90 minutes of sophisticated comedy by Rita Rudner at New York, New York's Cabaret Theatre and could have sat through another hour of her delightful comic litany of laughter as a wife, as a "dog mom" and life in general. 
So almost everyone changes a LOT as a person between 17 and 26. Yes, people in their 20s are going to be figuring out what they want to do in life, so how dare you try and keep a 26 year old inside the mold of a 17 year old and get mad when it doesn't work and she breaks free..

Lady Gaga won two Grammys during the pre telecast ceremony but didn't get a chance to show her multitude of outrageous dresses during the primetime show, losing out on record, song and album of the year. But she made her presence felt when she kicked off the night with a sequined green leotard with massive shoulders as she sang her Grammy nominated hit "Poker Face," then brought out Elton John as they melded her song "Speechless" and his classic "Your Song" together in a performance that featured dueling pianos, and glitter painted faces..

This is generally fine because you can use the unwanted unit to get dragonflowers, you can HM farm them to get up to 5000 feathers, and you can give their skills to another unit. In this case though, there is a bit of powercreep because some of the older units don have good skills to give, so in the end it might be a useless pull.Arena has changed quite a lot. It still has the higher BST gives a better score, so armors still dominate the top tiers (in particular the three trainee armored dragons, L!Tiki, H!Myrhh and W!Fae which have 183 BST, the highest amount), +10 units keep giving a higher score, and there the whole Legendary + blessings thing that ups the score as well, but since now the kills done with bonus units give bonus points, the meta changed to 3 support units + the bonus units.

The propofol hasn had time to be completely metabolized by the liver in 10 minutes, but it did have time to be redistributed to fatty tissues.If you give an anesthetic continuously for longer periods of time, you can actually build up a TON of anesthetic in your fatty tissues, and they will start leeching anesthetic back into your blood stream.Isoflurane is highly lipid soluble, and anesthesiologists know that if you give isoflurane continuously to an obese patient for a 10 hour case, they gonna have to wake the patient up in the ICU several hours after the surgery is over.

Another risk of chickenpox during pregnancy is that the infant may contract it. If the mother develops her chickenpox rash between 6 and 21 days before delivery, her baby's case is likely to be mild and require no treatment. But if the mother's rash develops later   from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery   and no steps are taken to shield her fetus, the newborn has a 25 percent chance of getting chickenpox between 5 and 10 days after birth.

When it comes to common Green Poker Felt, it is the least expensive, but it has some disadvantages.

The 2008 2 day Rally was held with good success approximately 80 bikes rode in the poker run. In 2009 there were over 100 bikes registering for the poker run and a few more events were scheduled on Saturday. For 2010, the event evolved into a 3 day rally with a Friday night concert, continuing the Show Shine, Biker Rodeo hosted by ABATE District 1, and an outstanding Fallen Firefighter Tribute coordinated by the Castle Rock Fire Department Color Guard. Over 180 bikes registered for the poker run on Sunday morning. Throughout the 3 day event over 1500 people came out and enjoyed our rural style of fun. The Rally Committee's goal is to keep expanding the event in future years and increasing our contributions to the Colorado Fallen Firefighter Foundation.

Another story I can think of is a guy that got too drunk and tipped his chair backwards off the deck of the float cabin. His buddy thought he was just joking around so they didnt grab him right away. By the time they realized it wasn a joke, guy had drowned and they had to have a diver come to retrieve the body from underneath the logs below the cabin.

No full time engineering job should be paying below $40,000/year. The 2019 location adjusted GS 7 step 1 rate is $41,000/year. This is the low end for the rate that the government pays for just out of school or otherwise inexperienced positions requiring a college education. If you take on an engineering position at a contractor you should almost certainly be earning more than this, even fresh out of school. Positions earning less than this are probably "technician" type positions that may not even require a college education. If you are doing actual engineering work with any competency, you are being undervalued if you are earning below $50k. Many contractors in the area would start an engineer in the low 60s.

This word "never," and the feeling with which he'd said it, forced me to take my violin and go back to the kitchen. He'd said it in a way that I could not refuse him. In the kitchen it was very loud and smoky. And I, after school, was very tired, and didn't know what to play.

Although clay poker chips are considered a premium selection, they do have their advantages and disadvantages. Their lifespan when used in casinos is about six years. They can break down easily after extended use but when cared for properly might last longer. It takes a few months to typically break into a set of clay chips when they will round themselves out taking on a vintage look. The clay chips available for consumer purchase are exactly the same as casino chips without the built in security features. Clay poker chips are usually lightweight.

I look to pick up a Sawyer Squeeze/MSR Trailshot and share that, it make your life much easier.Consider bringing some gloves. On days with constant rain and wind you will be thankful for them.You don seem to have any rain pants, which will almost be required in Scotland imo.Be aware some of the streams are not worth drawing water from the closer you get to civilization, depending on your route you may want to filter and carry more water before you get to patches such as those going through wind farms and farm land.You might want to consider some specific blister treatments since many of the tracks can be hard on your feet. If you don tend to get them (lucky you) then discount this.Lastly, the TGO is as social as you want it to be, but I would suggest making an effort to meet people if possible.

There was some concern last night about what all the redactions and the trade off with Kilimnik would amount to since they were brought up, at least, in this case. I wondering, if those were part of a separate ongoing investigation, hence the redactions up to and remaining through his sentencing, is it possible that a different investigation, one that implicates Trump and family, Stone and whoever else would be involved in the crux of this Russia investigation   which the SCO stated to the court per those redactions that "This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating.", is Paul Manafort able to be charged still with a whole new set of criminal charges apart from the personal bank fraud, failure to file and lying charges? It wouldn be double jeopardy because he hasn been charged with that. IANAL but if anyone could speak to that, that would be enlightening.

Job DescriptionThe job of New York's finest includes administrative tasks, meetings and routine patrol. Each shift begins with a briefing about what to expect during the day. It is at this meeting that each police officer learns about his daily assignment. In addition, updates about crime suspects, a review of activities during the previous shifts and other pertinent crime information is disseminated. During a shift, a police officer is on a regular patrol route, until she receives a call from dispatch. Common calls include domestic disturbances, medical calls, suspicious people, noise complaints, public intoxication, drug incidents, and traffic accidents. Some NYPD officers are assigned to foot patrol in parks and at special events. Directing traffic and participating in minor investigations is also a duty of a police officer.
However, it has been proposed that LFPC activity during RI could reflect the recruitment of additional "domain general" resources when processing more difficult problems in general as opposed to RI specifi  cally. Moreover, theoretical research with computational models has demonstrated that RI may be supported by dynamic processes that occur throughout distributed networks of brain regions as opposed to within a discrete computational module. Here, we present fMRI findings from a novel deductive reasoning paradigm that controls for general difficulty while manipulating RI demands. In accordance with the domain  general perspective, we observe an increase in frontoparietal activation during challenging problems in general as opposed to RI specifically. Nonetheless, when examining frontoparietal activity using analyses of phase synchrony and psychophysiological interactions, we observe increased network connectivity during RI alone. Moreover, dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian model selection identifies the LFPC as the effective connectivity source. Based on these results, we propose that during RI an increase in network connectivity and a decrease in network metastability allows rules that are coded throughout working memory systems to be dynamically bound. This change in connectivity state is top down propagated via a hierarchical system of domain general networks with the LFPC at the apex. and Walsh, V. 2018.

I found this fantastic photograph of the attendees of the meeting of the Astronomische Gesellschaft at Hamburg, August 1913 in the December issue 1913 issue of Popular Astronomy. This is an august group, and of course they not "blank" or "missing" its just a function of some out of context observations on the opaque overlay that serves to identify all of the folks in the massive group photo. (I encountered these numerous times over the years and always have found the Found Art aspect of them interesting and amusing.) The fact of the matter, though, is that there were some very high powered people at this meeting.

These are my opinions, I not the best EK in the world but I played it on and off since 2010.Whenever you feel like you can survive using it. I not sure how big your mana pool is, but you want to make sure you use enough mana potions to keep your up. Utito  > Gran  > Min  > Exori, or if you can get the mana, maybe Utito  > Exori  > Gran  > etc. Mana leech imbuements help A LOT.Same deal tbh, when you feel like you can survive using a 2h, do it. I use 1h for some hunts, 2h for others.Seems like BS to me. Use phys protection where you can get it. The difference between more armor and more physical % is minimal though, my guildie Itexo has a great youtube channel where he has compared armor vs phys %, amongst other things.Your main way of healing yourself is Exura Ico and life leech imbues. If that not enough, you need to use healing potions (remember that healing/mana pots have a shared cooldown). And if that not enough STILL, you need to use ss/might rings to prevent your hp going down too fast. Knights is not a voc that dies in one hit, a good knight can get out of most situations with enough use of supplies. Remember that you can put the amulets and rings on hotkeys.I use mana/hp/crit on weapons, mana/axe fighting on helmet and life/fire protection (optional, depends on what you doing) on chest. Different equipment have different amounts of imbue slots.

Final final thought   playing cash in HKD is an amazing lesson in how to disassociate your game from cash value. First time you raise up toHKD 300 (about US$40), it takes a moment to do the math and make sure you didn't over bet. Makes you start to think in terms of multiples of BB instead of actual cash value. Makes you a better player.

If you're a newbie to the blackjack game, you may want to avoid the seat on the far left of the table (third base.) Since this is the spot that comes right before the dealer, you're likely to get a lot of heat if you're the reason the dealer turns up a 5, or any good card for themselves, though you may be congratulated if you make the dealer bust.

The two are very different. Most of what we study, from kindergarten to university, involves solving problems, engaging in backward induction, employing contemplative thinking, understanding math and statistics. As hard as such problems can be, they do not require strategic intelligence. Strategic intelligence is what's needed to outsmart a cunning rival. To understand the difference, consider what it takes to predict the stock market performance vs. guessing the hand of a rival poker player. The stock market may be unpredictable, yet it is not actively trying to deceive you. A worthy opponent is doing just that.

Given the length of these wars already, you would think the administration and the military could actually figure out how much they need to spend. Importantly, given that $549BILLION has ALREADY been budgeted for these wars, you would think the administration wouldn have to request billions more in emergency funds  billions that are funded through growing deficits. The emergency? could possibly be unforeseen at this point?.

Also don't get confused with Lowball, common form Razz, in which the lower valued hands win. In that case an Ace would beat a pair since a pair is a terrible hand to have. No, 1 pair can lose to an ace high, depending on what is on the community table, for instance, if your pair is lower than the 2 pairs on the table, your opponent with an ace high will win.

But rather than a mother fearing passengers reactions, I rather we created a society where a mother might have reason to expect kindness and empathy instead. If she hadn had given these out, would passengers reactions have been harsher? The gifts are a nice gesture, but we collectively ought not need to be bribed to put that into consideration. We should see a crying baby and automatically excuse her and her mother. Minding a four month old baby in a confined unfamiliar space for 10 hours should be something we presume to pity, not secretly despise or directly confront. We oughtn need it in writing that we should look on her with forgiveness. A kinder, gentler world wouldn see a need for this kind of gesture. Let look softly on all babies in airplanes or any public transit for that matter. Let treat every mother and child as if they have just given us a "sorry, here a sweet" package.

Believe it or not, there is a price tag attached to weight. Naturally, if a poker chip is light it is going to be cheaper than one that is heavy. This is because of the fact that most light weight poker chips are constructed with cheap plastic. Higher priced materials such as clay composite, ceramic, and wood are used to create chips that are heavier. Therefore, the price will be a bit higher. If you are purchasing casino poker chips on a budget, it is important to pay special attention to the weight that you are purchasing.

I guess it's different because Colt and Debbie already lived together and then Larissa moved into an already established living situation. That's probably why Colt felt so torn between the two of them.

She feels like Larissa moved into HER house, so she's the HBIC. There's only room for one queenie in a castle. lol.

(I personally use the Andalou BB cream with SPF as well)Also. Everyone is saying, "live separately." But why not make it easier on yourselves, talk to your pastor about eloping and getting married, like tomorrow! You can have the wedding ceremony later! But why not make a public declaration of being married now? My husband and I did that after 3 months of dating. We eloped, moved in together, made a public declaration before our church and families, went to the courthouse to make it official and then had a wedding ceremony 6 months later.
Then I say once you see new growth on him, you can cut the stems where it lost a lot of leaves and put the tips back in the pot to fill out the pot. Does that make sense?

Also, the techniques have significant differences.

As a game, poker has become popular only over the past few years. Even a decade back, a few people used to know about the charm of this game and the rich people used to play this game to exploit themselves and others. Gradually, these games become popular among all the people and a stats say that every three people in US has at least one poker player. This game has fascinated the players so much that some of them have given their day to day jobs and playing poker in the casinos for earning their livelihood. The experts are able to make a lot of money and live like a king with the money that come from the casinos. But their success has great effects on the common and amateur players around.

Early in the draft if you are bidding on a guy that is likely to go at $30 and the bidding is $15 or $16, bang it to $25. You might get crickets or you might chase all but one rival out as the unsuspecting owners are caught off guard, and you end up buying at $27 and saving money.
