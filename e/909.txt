If it were entirely up to me, all the lazy memes would be removed. The fact that a country subreddit has been dominated by memes limited to controversial subjects that any person in the world would be familiar (Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen) with is definitely not the direction I want to see the sub go in.As far as this one goes, it wasn low effort and I thought it was funny. But like I say every single time this comes up, if it becomes the dominant form of content on the sub, like in the past week when /r/pics invaded, it worn out its welcome   a balance of content is the goal.rjjm88  0 points  submitted 22 days agoI don have much nostalgia for Nintendo characters, and Smash mechanics always felt too floaty and arbitrary to my tastes.

This question reminds me of a scene from the original Star Trek episode The Corbomite Maneuver where the Enterprise is hopelessly outmatched and the logical Spock makes a chess reference indicating they have lost. Kirk replies to the effect that instead of playing chess they should play poker, and proceeds to make a bluff that succeeds in getting them out of the situation. Of course later we learn it was less the fact that Kirk bluffed, and more that the aliens hadn't really intended to destroy the Enterprise. In Star Trek the Next Generation we see a similar pattern, where second in command Commander Riker is great at poker, usually managing to somehow induce the other player(s) to make the wrong assessment as to whether or not he is bluffing.

For many Americans the question of when the horrors of war would come to American soil was not a question of if, but when, and would they be able to confront it when it did.

Michael Moorer gives us valuable insight into boxing, and particularly into training in an article at Fight Hype; "I see these guys that half ass fight, and some of them down here in training, they half ass train, and thats not how I was brought up."

At the end of the day; playing poker in RDR2 like the other players have bad hands is the very reason why you might be losing. Always expect the other player to have the stronger hand if you don and fold quickly if the flop is unfavourable to you. The only time when you can successfully bluff an opponent is when you chip leader and they call just shy of an all in, with a few chips kept in reserve.

Anyway, I decided to power through some heavish front squat triples before benching on Sunday. Turns out that really didn fucking help, so for the past couple of days and probably the next week or two (or three), I decided to chill out and do rehab and bodyweight work to get my shit sorted out (again). Honestly I could probably keep doing barbell lifts while rehabbing but I don want to risk aggravating things even more, and I honestly kind of looking forward to the temporary change of pace. 
For example, if you were planning on lifting 50 kg, you should start out with a few reps of 20 kg to ensure that the muscles are warmed up and ready for higher loads. 
Here is one simple example    means "car or vehicle." Notice I taught you that in English so all you really need to know to be able to read it is some understanding of what a vehicle is. The Japanese reading for this would be "kuruma" and the Chinese reading would be "sha." You would use the Chinese when building more complex words like "Jidosha"  which is roughly analogous to "auomobile.".

When i was a kid I watched a marionette action show called Supercar it had a high creep factor to it what with the marionette eyes and mouths and all, but I watched it anyway, I guess, because that was probably the only cartoon being broadcast at that hour. (It was filmed in "Supermarionation", which utilized electric moving parts in the marionettes in addition to string controls. It was the brainchild of Gerry Anderson, who also brought you Fireball XL5 for which I can still sing the theme song.) And that is what struck me seeing the reasoning for this "atomic bomb car" it really is just a car with a high creep factor that is outfitted for camping, but it is being sold in the patent as a ways for urban dwellers to survive the coming nuclear holocaust (" our greater areas of human congestion have slowly begun to face the threat of eventual atomic destruction"). citizens at the time owned 30 million cars, there was a potential to have 30 million bomb shelters (or whatever) on wheels. (This is also the first time I have seen the phrase "atomically attacked".)

I worked as a host for Red Lobster in college and got accused of being racist multiple times for seating people in the back of the restaurant. The reality was that our servers each had assigned tables they took care of and as a host my job was to stagger the seating so that the servers had more or less equal numbers of tables. This also was for the benefit of the customer as it allowed servers to manage their tables easier and give more prompt service.

Communication is a process where we share our feelings, thoughts, experience, ideas, suggestions, feedback etc. So before communicating with other person we usually think of how to speak, what to speak, when to speak, which channel I should adopt to communicate, how can I make it effective, how to respond to the feedbacks etc. It's not necessary to follow any persons definitions or explanation. 
While true to a point, and understanding that one person can only speak to their own experience, it can help to ascribe goodwill to these kinds of questions rather than laziness or malice.

Initially as a trainee and then as a junior securities analyst at BAM, Stout is now able to put his ideas into action. The novel follows Stout as he steadily builds his personal investment account by exploring opportunities that had germinated during the Wharton years. Among them, he closely follows Resorts International, a casino operator that is making a big bet on Atlantic City, hoping to create an East Coast rival to Las Vegas casinos. Instead of relying just on what he reads, Stout makes several trips to the construction site to speak with the workers and learn for himself what is going on. As the stock gradually rises, well meaning advisors suggest that he sell to safeguard his profits. But Stout's appetite for measured risk, coupled with his gambler's instincts, encourage him to hold on to his investment even after it has tripled in value.

You losing EV if you don seems simple, but there are more factors. How tilted are you going to get if you make a correct pot odds call (but still likely to lose the hand) and then lose the pot? What if you are currently up and this would make you down for the session? How important is it to you to book a win on any given session? I would argue that if you can look past all of these factors and still stick to maximizing EV you have an even bigger edge over the people who are concerned about this other stuff..

Alternatively, two muscles that attach below the knee joint that are capable of producing the pain you describe are gracilis (also a hip adductor, but crosses the knee joint), and sartorius. The action of sartorius is to flex the knee, flex the hip, and internally rotate the hip. When cycling and strongly pulling up on the pedals (as in a seated, low cadence climb), sartorius is powerfully contracting and can lead to both a tendon friction injury across the medial joint line (inside of the knee) and also an inflammation of the bursa (fluid filled sac designed to reduce friction) at its insertion (attachment) below the knee. Inflammation of this bursa (pes anserine bursa) produces a particularly exquisite burning pain. If it is one injury, sartorius fits the bill. If a secondary injury followed then it requires more posts..

This is a misrepresentation and a fear based way to analyze a dog's breed or breeds. In this particular incident there was no genetic testing done, and there were no purebred papers (canine   canis lupus familiaris). There is no actual proof of this dog's breed(s) and it is all heresay, which is not proof, science or fact. 
I think she's purposely backing off the planting theory to get them to comply with her testing requests. If she keeps attacking the state that they are guilty of something they will keep fighting her. There is a new AG so I think she's just trying to play nice to get some leeway. All the things you mentioned I agree with but about a new trial. KK did not prove the murder happened the way he described, if anything Kathleen could tear that story apart in a new trial. I just say if he's guilty let the evidence stand and prove it. Give her full access to test everything. Car bones whatever they have. The fact that they aren't willing to is suspect.
Bachelor of Oral Health in 2016 working in the Faculty of Dentistry's simulation clinic. (Source: medical school has always been a big part of Otago University, and for many years it was the only place in New Zealand where doctors could be trained. As the school expanded, the number of patients in Dunedin for the students to get practical experience was insufficient, so clinical schools were opened in Christchurch and Wellington, with outposts in other areas. Otago University has consciously maintained a high profile outside Dunedin, for example with a prominent building in upper Queen Street, Auckland, and reading this section of the book did leave me wondering about the value of our local universities competing with each other   does competition raise academic standards, or is it just competing for more student enrolments?

Try to use hands that block your opponents premiums and value range but still have some equity when called.(In your example A2s is a better hand to bluff with than A9s because of the extra equity for the straight and you reduce the combos of Ax he can have). 
The enabling her kids to be assholes thing is what really gets me heated. She definitely is enabling them, fussing at them or no. They may get yelled at but there is no follow through, no repercussions on their actions. My husband and I cut ties with a couple who have 3 horrible kids who wouldn stop this kind of behavior. At a party at our house they dumped blowing bubbles into our kiddie pool and got into it, soaking themselves and splashing the other kids, then ran around inside the house getting soapy water everywhere. The parents yelled but did absolutely nothing to stop them or help clean up the mess.

Having one of these programs is extremely helpful for playing online poker. If you're playing a sensical number of tables (say, up to 4 or 6), this is probably all you'll need. If you play a ton of tables, you might want a little more help. TableNinja is a commercial program that will help you massively multi table, doing things like auto filling in your preferred bet sizes, auto bringing your mouse to the table that needs action next, auto registering you for sit n gos, and lots more. I sometimes use a simpler (and free) AutoHotKey script, called StarsPlanner, which I use just to automatically place my mouse near the buttons of the next table needing action; I find that helpful for reducing RSI inducing motion even when I'm only playing a few tables.

He can manipulate anyone to believing he is dangerous and effective (reference 2008 9 election campaign), he also does not have South Africa in his best interests (A lion kills its prey for survival and provision for his family, which in Zuma's case would not be beneficial to wipe out his political competition, as this would result in mass uprisings in the country) and lastly I will give you one point, he is a tactical man, but as we all know not a very smart one. If he was smart then we wouldn't be having the scandals we are having right now. So maybe he's actually just scrambling for whatever is left on the carcass before being ripped away by the powers that be..

Dr. Fasano and other experts speculate that once immune cells are mistakenly primed to attack gluten, they can migrate and spread inflammation, even to the brain.Indeed, Marios Hadjivassiliou, a neurologist in Sheffield, England, says he found deposits of antibodies to gluten in autopsies and brain scans of some patients with ataxia, a condition of impaired balance.Could such findings help explain why some parents of autistic children say their symptoms have improved sometimes dramatically when gluten was eliminated from their diets? To date, no scientific studies have emerged to back up such reports.Dr.

As mentioned, I will even use some of the content wrote, highlighted in bold to give credit for his writing, although I hear he quit playing so he probably wouldn care regardless. Hopefully that way it easier to combine all of the information rather than me trying to re write some of his concepts and call them my own, which isn necessary.

A tip for using halftones: At small sizes, the angle of the halftone dots can create an unintentional optical illusion of lines and squares called a moir pattern. An easy way to negate this is to slightly rotate the pattern so that it's not on a perfectly square angle (22 degrees is what I usually go with).

In the popular conception, Greece and Rome are treated as these monoliths, yet their civilizations spanned many centuries (millennia depending on whether you count the fall of the Western or Eastern Empire as the end date), and changed and developed dramatically within that period. Greece comprised many city states, which while sharing some cultural elements, had vastly different forms of government and priorities. Rome went from a kingdom to a republic to a empire, and even within these periods underwent vigorous debate and reforms.

Back in the 1800s, poker players seemed to use any small valuable object imaginable. Early poker players sometimes used jagged gold pieces as well as chips   primarily made of wood and clay. By the 20th century, poker chip designs began to play a greater prominence, and the smooth edges of older chips gave way to chips with engraved slits to keep them neatly stacked together. Most recently, affordable plastic poker chips appeared in the 1940s.

Finally, if nothing else, get yourself accustomed to living far within your means. Save as much money as/where you can. Don take on debt (a single credit card is fine, but keep the balance on it low and pay it off as quickly as possible.) Buy nice so you not buying twice. Take care of your belongings. If you marry, insist on as small or as simple a wedding as possible. If you want children, marry very carefully first (don stick your dick into Crazy; if you a woman, don let Crazy stick his dick in you), buy second hand clothing and toys whenever possible, keep both to what manageable for your space and circumstances; and don let anyone stray you from the goal of keeping at least a step ahead of the crunch.

Was a heroin addict, so of course I done lots of bad things. Me and my boyfriend were friends with this other junkie couple. Not really friends, but I had met the girl in rehab a few years before, and recently connected, just because sometimes our dealers would be out and wed ask then to buy some of their stash, they would always act supper willing but would rup us off so bad. And neither of them had IDs and would ask us to meet them at a walgreens and buy syringes fir them, wed agree and they would make us wait hours there, kept saying they were close. They were always making us wait hours on them. Once they asked us to get a hotel room for them, because we had out IDs. They fave us money and we got a room for them. The second time they asked us, we were low on cash, and just tired of their bs. They lived in their car, and hadn slept in a bed in a week, and asked us to get them a hotel. Well I made my boyfriend park up the street because the motel only had in exit. And they gave me the money and I pretended to walk in the office, but really I just hid from them in their car, and when I thought they weren looking I ran for it. I very out of shape, and ran with the money, all the way to the back of the motel and to the next parking lot. Got in the CSR, with $96, called up my dealer and deleted her and blocked her phone number and Facebook.

By Dezzie Lightbulb: Boxing has always been plagued with what ifs. What if Ali and Tyson had met in the ring, each in his prime? What if Cottos team had properly checked Margaritos gloves before their fight? What if such and such a judge had bought himself a new pair of spectacles the day of yet another crazy decision? What if, what if, what if! These questions can never be fully answered. They can haunt us, and remain as cruelly tantalizing after twenty years as they were the first day. The latest what if to storm the boxing world is; what if Pacquiao has been using PEDs or steroids? Even longtime, faithful Pacquiao fans must have asked themselves, although probably in the privacy of their most inner selves, what if its true. What if Pacquiao has always been a cheat, his whole boxing career nothing more than a second rate, shabby sham?

These dishes   along with the likes of ubiquitous egg rolls and kung pao chicken   are Canadian culinary cornerstones.

Bzgl. Kino: das grte hier ist das Cineplex in der Stadtmitte. Das Kino arbeitet zusammen mit dem Eden Palast wie du auf der Seite sehen wirst. Der Eden Palast ist ein sehr kleines, kuscheliges wohlfhl Kino  > also evtl. gerade fr Neuankommer toll. Ich wei ja nicht wofr deine Freundin nach hier zieht, aber falls sie hier studieren wird: das Apollo ist mitten im Studentenviertel und somit das "Studenten Kino". Auerdem laufen da Filme die nirgentdwo anders laufen.

They also have Bergantino amps which I not heard of. Plus darkglass microtubes (but I doubt that fit my style, I don know their versatility and every demo video is essentially metal or something much much heavier than I need). They also have some older Edens and a Genz Benz Shuttle 3 (which might not have enough power for me).

But you need to make sure it works, otherwise all you will show your visitors is a short code marking the place where a contact form should be showing. Sometimes you update your WordPress, or it does the updating for you automatically, but you fail to do the same with your plugins. Other times you forget to install the plugin altogether, or fail to activate it. But there are times when the captcha is not working, and it fails to show the security code to visitors.

I disagree. I agree with the other comment reply actually. Also, if you look at the details, it the worst in 1st and 2nd year white medical students, students who haven actually worked with people yet. It states that 4th years were much more accurate in their diagnosis of pain and that they had less bias. In the next sentence it says that actual doctors, not students, do not have racial bias when measured. That the vast majority of doctors, plus they argue that no minorities were biased for or against blacks. I fail to see how that would definitely lead to an only white opioid epidemic. (I not an expert, just read the article, if you want to discuss I happy to)There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking your doctor and getting an explanation and reassurance from him! Most doctors like to see their patients engaged with their medical care. That being said, there actually some really interesting research being conducted right now into using ultrasounds in the brain to treat some diseases. I not an expert, but I don know of any serious neurological dangers to having an ultrasound near your brain. Again, your doctor would know more about this specific procedure and the research or risks behind it than anyone on the internet would.

Lot of parents view genetics as a long term solution.They are going to want to know how we can accelerate the pace of research such that we can find answers now. Studies often are used to distinguish between environmental and genetic influences on medical disorders. Identical twins share nearly 100 percent of their genes, and fraternal twins share about half of their genes.In both cases the siblings early developmental environment   both in the womb and after birth are very similar.Several small twin studies in the past decade looked at how common it was for twin siblings to share an autism diagnosis, and results of those studies placed genetics as the primary cause of autism.But some scientists believe that those studies weren large enough to note the differences in shared diagnoses rates between identical and fraternaltwins.The new study is the largest, and the most diverse, to look at twins.Of the 192 pairs of twins in the study, 54 were identical and 138 were fraternal.

I sell animal feed. Purina Pro Plan dog food isn too many steps above Wal Mart low end kibble. Science diet is only a little better and hugely overpriced. You much better going with a regional brand. If you really want a healthy dog food too, buy something grain free with chicken, venison, beef, or pork as the number one ingredient. By products aren necessarily bad, either, but just make sure there isn an overabundance of them. Cat food is generally the same vein.

Attach the pictures to the backing material. Use white glue, Mod Podge, double sided tape or similar adhesive. If you are using a thicker material such as wood or foam core, you may need a stronger adhesive. Some glues and tapes will not last as long or may discolor the pictures over time. Use an archival quality tape or glue if you want your collage to last, or if you are giving it as a gift. Paint on the glue with a paintbrush to ensure complete and smooth coating. Press the picture down onto the backing sheet. Use a credit card to smooth out any air bubbles. Dab a bit more glue or other adhesive at the corners to ensure they stick fully to the paper.

It always just comes across as very "looking for points" to me, same with the people who are like "well actually this person could be asexual!" I think it good to question assumptions and use language that doesn assume, but in a case like this where it is very very likely that Alison is in fact aware of the LW gender   it just a bit on the performative side to me.

Ms White has remained steadfast. "Overwhelmingly the feedback we get is very supportive of our move to restrict poker machines to casinos," she told reporters at Penguin in the final week of campaigning. "My focus hasn changed.

Westfield Stratford City in East London is not Las Vegas   even if the people who populate it seem to share the same affection for athleisure wear. It is, however, home to Aspers Casino, a 65,000 square foot gaming space with wall to wall slot machines, 55 table and poker games, and, on the weekend I made an impromptu appearance at the 888Poker LIVE Festival London Main Event in the poker room last October, heaving with humanity and out there optimism.

Perhaps they have less tolerance for hypocrisy and a disconnect between promises and actions.That is not what the mainstream press is suggesting.

However, I did not read the pilates abstract.I would agree with your Doctor and your Personal Trainer, "I couldn quite get out of him what he meant by lighter weight and am not sure how this is measured. If I feel my back twinging on DLs, I lower the weight automatically." while resistance training may be detriment if resistance loads are excessively heavy, light load benefits are too great to resistance training all together.So, the Gold Standard of measuring Resistance Fitness in individuals is, 1 Repetition Maximum [1RM] (as you may know.) A 1RM is the max a person can lift, it is an all out effort.Consider this article from 1991 which reported, "The reaction moments at the knee, hip, and L4/L5 joints, and the compressive and shearing forces on L4/L5 are documented in powerlifters competing in a national powerlifting championship .

I chose Green Finch and Linnet Bird by world renown composer Stephen Sondheim mostly because I was fascinated by its two most common stylistic interpretations. Within the realm of the musical, you can interpret the song assuming Johanna has already lost her mind, leading to a much stronger, more manic illustration, or you can interpret the piece assuming that Johanna is still sane. The second interpretation leads to a more somber, almost melancholy sound, adding an underlying sense of longing to the end of each phrase.

A seperate side conclusion I came across is what combat speed by race means. There are posts on the internet talking about how the "Combat Move Speed mult" that should benefit races like Hiver Prince supposedly doesn seem to make any meaningful difference in game. If you take the ideas presented by this video though, it is possible that what that combat speed racial multiplier does is make the Hiver Prince more resistant to combat speed penalties from heavier armor. The video suggests that items such as the wooden sandals don actually award you a bonus to combat speed outright, but rather they can be equipped to cancel out some of the negative combat speed penalties on items like the Samurai Chestplate. If this is true, the implication is that a Shek would see a more pronounced combat speed penalty than a Hiver Prince when wearing Heavy armor. When both of them use light armor, there should be no noticeable difference between their attack speeds. When both are wearing full heavy armor with decent combat speed penalties, it possible the Hivers retain their combat speed better. This would also heighten the value of the wooden sandals since there are alternatives for protecting the legs via leggings anyways, and equipping them would be enough to counteract the combat speed penalty of samurai chestplates or the like. Assassin Rags on the other hand seem like overkill, although this would imply you can equip them safely with whatever chain armor you like with zero fear of your combat speed being reduced. I have to test this in game sometime to see if I can notice any difference, as a great number of factors (strength requirement met) can override other attack speed rules.

Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know. 
To the same effect, please be aware of which subreddit you're commenting in. We get so many posts that we have to triage for lack of a better word, we know people like the ones they recognize and know a history on, but there's so many first time posters that have finally built up the courage to post, and it's truly disheartening sometimes to see someone reaching out for what to them is a lifeline, and for what to you is just a quick comment, but sometimes they're either used to other subs, or they aren't 100% on the sub rules. These are the ones that if you see an acronym that's amazingly  not in our sidebar glossary and say things like TIFU, or read like a mix of a relationships post and a help wanted add, or one that we've seen entirely too much of recently, AITA. Please if you see a post that's mainly MIL, but you know SO is partly to blame, suggest politely that they might want to post to r/JustNoSO as well, but as our rules have been for quite a long time, no SO bashing, which includes infantalizing. These are things that we get feedback from users that it scares them off from posting again. If you see a way to advise so that your How to Train Your MIL comes with a preview of SO'l House on it, remember the rating for that preview is PG, aka pretty good. As for that last spare acronym up there, that should be r/LostRedditor territory. Even if the put that in there, calling an OP an asshole if you disagreee couldn't be further from supportive. Instead please go with the spirit of the request and politely guide the OP in the correct direction.

If you allow the spices in the dressing for that salad or sandwich filling to steep and develop a short while, they'll do a fine job flavouring your creation.That's certainly how I felt after digging into today's recipe for curried shrimp stuffed papaya. The mayonnaise based shrimp filling chills and melds in the refrigerator an hour before being spooned into the papaya, giving it plenty of time to develop flavour.However, in some salads that I'll serve right away, such as a Singapore noodle salad, I will "bloom" the curry powder used in oil first.

Consider, for example, the relatively recent launch of the "U" feminine care products by Kotex. These black packages easily draw attention from shoppers at shelf amidst a sea of predominantly pastel packaging from other players in the category. Indeed, cleverly designed windows on the package reveal pastel packets inside, a cue to category norms. Thus a new to the category brand effectively communicates to consumers by being both differentiated from the category and relevant at the same time.

Like Katrina, there were warnings. This was not last month that Gimein was warning about exploding "ARMs;" it was April of 2008. And he was not alone in warning us about the subprime mortgage crisis of the middle and upper classes.

The market, also known as unfettered greed, was the hurricane. Now homeowners are being told to suck it up and somehow pay off the mortgages.

Practice with a single ball at a time, one hand then the other, until your throws are consistently accurate. Practice in front of your bed (so you won't have to bend down to the floor to catch fallen balls) and don't worry about catching the balls. Focus on throwing. When you can throw consistently, you'll find that catching the balls is trivial.

It was at this time thought that this manner of interring their Dead was not common to all ranks of People, as this was the first we had seen Except the Skeleton just mentioned; but various were the opinions concerning the Provisions, etc., laid about the Dead. Upon the whole, it should seem that these people not only believe in a Supreem being, but in a future state also, and this must be meant either as an Offering to some Deitie or for the use of the Dead in the other world; but this latter is not very probable, as there appeared to be no Priest Craft in the thing, for whatever Provisions were put there it appeared very plain to us that there it remain'd until it consumed away of itself. It is most likely that we shall see more of this before we leave the Island, but if it is a Religious ceremony we may not be able to understand it, for the Misteries of most Religions are very Dark and not easily understood, even by those who profess them..

This drama stealing reminds me of my alcoholic/drugging aunt who abandoned her daughter and my mother and father took her in. Growing up she was more like my sister then my cousin, we were very close. She had a tough early life dad was never around, also a crackhead, well when she turned 18 he came back into the picture she decided she wanted to move out and reconcile with him. Ended up being hooked on heroin in a short matter of time and for the next ten years in and out of rehab, over dosing, and stealing from my parents, grandparents or whoever. She finally didn come back from her last overdose it devastated us all but we were happy she was in a better place.
