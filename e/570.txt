Thank you! Unfortunately I was not nearly as good at standing up for myself in my teens when someone made me feel uncomfortable, but now I gotten much better at putting my foot down now that I older and more confident, and I recognize how these types of guys get away with doing things you not comfortable with "because you don want to be rude". So now I make it a point to protect my friends as well who haven developed those instincts yet. It helps that I married and don care about impressing some handsome stranger; if he makes me uncomfortable he gonna hear about it.

OP freely admits she didn say anything to the kids or the MIL until after all of this happened. She relied on BF to say it even though she admits herself she knew BF wouldn do it.

I don understand why this area isn gentrifying. The location is good, there an mtr there, very close to mk, tst, central is just a few stops away, there are plenty of buses to ssp. By all means it should be gentrifying but it somehow is still stuck in the 90s. They say real estate is all about location location location. Yet there are areas way more inconvenient like TKO, Shau Kei Wan, tsuen wan, tung chung, yuen long, that cost more than SSP to live in.

Now, fruit. in Milton work, and the stuff cited below) to have been a much larger driver of brain evolution across primates than a bunch of other factors. This is because it is a rarer and more monopolisable resource, which means hierarchies form, which means you have to have the social intelligence to deal with those hierarchies, schmooz with the group members, socially finesse others, etc. You also have to track seasonal production, which requires a spatial map of your territory.

No, the reality is we all suffer and worry, and in most cases "being happy" is only a temporary reprieve, never a state able to be attained or sustained.

Troy's biggest concern was trying to figure out why the Blackjack Sniper informational product was better than all the others out there. What he came up with was that there is no complicated formulas attached to this program. I did ask him at one point why that was different from others (considering I've seen this on many of them); Troy explained that all you have to do is add cards. The system itself actually tells you what to do next, which means you don't have to read about a large amount of strategies or anything. Once he made his case, Gerry and I couldn't agree more.

Invest some time in researching the area where you want to try your luck. Study the history of the area, visit the courthouse for old maps and records and read newspaper archives. You don t even have to go to the library, the internet allows you to research locations anywhere in the world. If you can locate the site of old fair grounds, carnivals and concerts locations or perhaps a field where auctions are held, you will often find a lot of coins that were dropped. Another way to find local historical information is to shop local antique stores for old pictures or postcards. Most old postcards have a photo of a significant locale, such as parks, casinos, festivals, important buildings and beaches which can inspire you to hunt in otherwise overlooked locations. You will find as you explore these old sites that while the buildings may have changed the land remains, hiding the treasures beneath. More lost treasures have been found by carefully research than by swinging a metal detector at random.

Hausdorffparty  4 points  submitted 3 days agoIt actually turns out that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain, which I think is what /u/columbus8myhw is getting at regarding Z. This means it doesn necessarily have a total order, but there is a "valuation" (the complex modulus) which follows specific rules with multiplication, which allow us to follow a division algorithm much like the division algorithm in Z. Euclidean domains are always UFDs, and so this is a "fast" way to justify that Z and Z[i] have unique prime factorization.

Texas poker even has different versions, as there are no limit, pot limit, and fixed limit variations. These all referred to various wagering limits during the course of a given hand, the basic rules of the games themselves remained unchanged. The no limit version is the kind played on television. It is probably the most exciting and that is why it gets so much airtime. In no limit poker, a player can make the famous all in bet at during any round of betting. In pot limit poker, players are limited in their wagering to the size of the pool, or pot, while betting. Fixed limit poker has hard and fast rules about how much you can bet, or a multiple of the ante, as the betting limit.

In Swat, Dir and parts of Buner our army has suffered heavy casualties. If the US military had suffered a quarter of these casualties in the two months or so since the Swat operation started, there would have been a storm in Washington. But since it is Pakistan's 'peasant' army suffering these losses it is a different matter altogether. Washington, however, is not to blame. If we remain chumps when it comes to bargaining with the US, the fault is not in our stars but us. Other countries will not put a proper value on us or what we do unless we first put a proper value on ourselves. If we go about with hangdog looks, our leaders ever so grateful for the smallest attention they get, we shouldn't be surprised if

The real question on this one is, has this dude donked with TP or better? If this was a drawee board or a low board, you might think that he donked to protect his TP type hand and take value of draws, but this is not a drawee board and its not a low board. If he has TP, the only reason he is betting is for value, and would he really bet here for value off an 8 or worse?! I think he be more likely to check and let you bluff. So, I think we can happily say that he doesn usually have TP. If he had the nuts instead, we would expect him to play deceptively, trying to get a raise in at some point.

How common property is administered is determined through the bylaws and rules of the corporation or the resolutions approved by the owners at general meetings.Any significant change in the use or appearance of common property requires the approval of the owners by a three quarters vote at an annual or special general meeting.If the strata corporation is heading into a deficit, the council has several options. It could simply complete the balance of the year and if there is a deficit, the owners repay the deficit amount in the following fiscal year as either part of the next operating budget by majority vote or a special levy or contingency expense by three quarters vote.The council could also convene a special general meeting before the fiscal year end to approve a special levy to make up the projected differences, or seek the approval of the owners by three quarters vote to suspend operations of the pool facilities to the end of the fiscal year.While I appreciate the fiscal prudence of your council, it also has to be recognized the pool facilities are a key part of your resort property through the winter, and closing the facility may have negative impact on your owners' ability to rent their units.If your strata council does not respond, you may, by 20 per cent petition of the owners, demand a special general meeting to direct the council by majority vote to open the facilities.

I don know if that is necessarily an exposition. Motti seems to know little about what he is speaking of. Hence the surprise when choked. Vader may just be saying "faith" as a one liner badass diss.

The term "dashboard" didn't originate with traffic jams that made drivers want to dash their head against something hard in the hopes of losing consciousness, but instead was passed down to us from the horse and buggy days. Fans of the song "Jingle Bells" have long known that the proper speed for a one horse open sleigh was "dashing," but when horses started to dash along o'er the fields, bells on bobtails weren't the only things ringing. The cries of the driver and passenger likely also rang out as they got splattered with mud, meaning that spirits were definitely not bright, and laughing all the way wasn't an option. So along came a piece of wood that protected the buggy's passengers from all the mud and slush, which was known as the dashboard.

In ancient times, as now, commonly used essential oils such as frankincense, eucalyptus, ginger, patchouli, and rosewood came from the furthest reaches of the globe. These vital components of religious ceremonies, medicine, food, cosmetics, and aphrodisiacs were in great demand and were more costly than precious metals and jewels. Although each region could produce clothing, shelter, and food from the resources in its immediate territory, people of all nations craved rare, exotic odors that literally added spice to their lives and lent an air of mystery to their ceremonies..

So fruit is very very important in primate evolution   and definitely not as a staple diet across primates. Consider, for example, folivores vs. frugivores. Or insectivores. Or gumivores. Fruit is only a staple for frugivores (macaques, chimps, us, capuchins, spider monkeys, etc.)   that the definition of frugivore. So fruit is certainly important and has a well documented correlation with brain size.

After thelred's death, and after nearly 36 years of raiding, England was severely weakened. However, there is evidence that suggests that England could have been a lot stronger. Edmund Ironsides, thelred's son, openly fought the Viking forces of Cnut effectively for the first time. The result at the battle of Ashingdon was a victory for Cnut against Edmund Ironsides, yet Edmund Ironsides maintained the freedom of the Kingdom of Wessex for the period of his reign, even though it proved to be only for just one year. Despite the defeat at Ashingdon, Edmund's actions showed that England was capable of raising an army against Viking invaders.

You can trace your logic back of "X side actions were a response to Y side action before that" in a cyclical cycle going back to before 1948.

And you can say that Israeli hardline policies and construction of checkpoints etc were a result of Palestinian terrorist attacks.

Moon made it to the heads up finale with a string of improbable TKOs, including one of highly touted pro Phil Ivey, who went out in seventh place, and then Begleiter. Those two knockouts came in rapid succession, and both times Moon held ace queen, was behind at the start and then got just the card he needed. In Ivey's case, Moon faced an ace king but won when he paired his queen. In Begleiter's case, Moon faced a pair of queens and won when he paired his ace. Says Little: "He was getting better than average distribution throughout the tournament," which is pro speak for landing killer cards.

The importance of natural plant products for cognition has been underestimated, in part because the active ingredient(s) in the plant extracts remained unknown, limiting data interpretation. In the majority of studies the compounds under investigation are a mixture of ingredients in which the most potent factor is likely to be diluted. Indeed, animal studies were often performed in aged rodents or transgenic mouse models for neurodegenerative disease [43] because compounds had minimal effects in normal young subjects [44]. However, it seems that plant polyphenols, which are the principal sources of flavanols, a subclass of phytochemicals known as flavonoids, might mediate the observed cognitive effects [42]. In cell culture, flavanols have europrotective, antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties [45]. In vivo, individual flavanols can enhance synaptic plasticity and learning [12,46]. The flavanol (!)epicatechin is of particular interest because this compound crosses the blood brain barrier after ingestion in food or drink [12,42]. Consumption of this flavanol improved retention of spatial memory in the water maze, whereas the approved AD drug memantine did not [12].

On the river the most likely hands he has are slow played trips and a bunch of draws that maybe got there, maybe didn AT is unlikely to lead on the river (esp. With you being the aggressor), so what are you really winning? You essentially beating a bluff and a really sloppily played AT. To me, this is a fold.. 
Completely backwards. Games where the average edge is much smaller (in general, games where you see more cards like Omaha) have HIGHER variance because more players are likely remain in each hand chasing draws, etc. More players in each hand seeing more streets and with more opportunities to connect with the board = more variance.

But PPP's Naveed Qamar was dot on.

In Vietnam you get more chewy tendons and stuff rather than protein and fat. This adds to 1. it too expensive for most people to eat 500g of beef every night.

A lot of things go through your head when you get stabbed, usually along the lines of, "There's a long piece of metal inside my body. I may require assistance to deal with this."

The coffee we all love so much has many uses beyond just waking us up in the morning. One of those uses is to create a coffee body scrub. It's usually just the high prices that deter us from enjoying the benefits of exfoliating body scrubs. Since most of us have a canister of coffee grounds in the kitchen, creating this scrub will be easy, beneficial, and most of all, cheap! Not to mention that the coffee itself has added benefits for your skin and body that many body scrubs do not provide.

If it is going to be used with pasta we will be adding Parmesan which the creaminess/ fat is going to counter balance the acidity as well.

I need to do some more research before I make up my mind. I think it important to bear in mind that these are "broken" or "worker" elephants. The feeding, the walking around, etc., serves to bring tourists there, which generates income, which helps keep these elephants free and free more elephants.. 
I felt pretty gross after that; it seems like there needs to be some very strong vetting of some of these cases for shows like this. What to prevent an abusive family member/ex partner from acting normal for the show just so they can have professional help to find their victim again?

His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. 
I also grew up with parents with a modicum of common sense who basically treated any adult as a possible sexual predator, priests included. I have kids in the Church now, and our Church has pretty strict rules from the diocese basically barring any adults from being alone with children.

Uses terms like "alpha" and "beta" in describing human relationships. Talks about attractiveness in terms of "sexual market value". run. Run the other way.
I think you should rethink accusing someone of being an apologist based on very little information. This is part of what drives moderates away from the Democratic party. You are doing exactly what I described in my first response to you. You don know me, yet you immediately want to accuse me of something pretty awful, kicking me out of the tribe. You immediately separate someone who is actually very similar in policy goals to you. That completely unnecessary and, quite frankly, offensive.

Yet when his mother uncharacteristically takes a trip out of town, he is forced to finally make an effort to take his place as an adult. The film inter splices its series of long, static takes with documentary style interviews and panning shots of Tripoli, but without obvious reason. Adding to the unease with the film direction, the camera technique is inconsistently unsteady to give a sense of realistic voyeurism or, more believable, as a result of amateur filmmaking. 
Sometimes you simply can't get off your feet, because your job requires you to stand or walk a lot or because you're stuck in an area where there isn't a place to sit down. In the latter situation   for instance, if you're sightseeing or shopping all day   do whatever you can to temporarily relieve the pressure on each foot. Walk as much as you can rather that standing still; wiggle your toes; shift back and forth from one foot to another; stand on one foot while lifting the other slightly off the ground and rotating the ankle.
And what if you never even finished that degree or the degree is more or less worthless because it from a school with no prestige? So then you get some job that does not pay a livable wage and without health insurance so you can take on even more debt through credit cards. Or when a medical issue comes up your "friends" at the bank will now give you a medical credit loan. And then when you die, heavily in debt, your family can take out a funeral loan. That way the banks can continue to extract wealth from poor Americans though out their lives and afterlives.
Yes, but it usually the healthier ones that say it. The patients that will probably die during their current admission/time in my unit don usually know. Usually I say something like "that why you are here" or "I trying to prevent that from happening", but sometimes "I don know" is the only answer I can give.

Ok pay attention noob cuz I'm only going to explain this once. We have a raising range and calling range and a folding range. GTO (Game Theory Optimal) means that you must make your opponent indifferent so that way you can't be exploited! By putting some strong hands into your folding range such as AQo you really throw them for a loop of coarse this isn't a "must" for the micros but you should get in the habit of it so once you start playing advanced opponents you don't make rookie mistakes like OP did. Perfect example.

Et bien, pour ma part, je ne suis pas choqu! Pourquoi payer les enseignants 35h et que ceux ci ne soient pas prsents les 35h au lyce.

Toutes ces activits peuvent d'ailleurs tre ralises dans l'enceinte de l'tablissement. On peut se demander alors pourquoi cette proposition heurterait les enseignants.

Honestly, it's too stressful to worry about always having an orgasm. Yes, I like when I do, but I'd rather focus on feeling good than be worried about hitting that. I want to be in the moment with my guy, and if that means that I don't prioritize having an orgasm, I'm ok with that.

In other words, ideological commitments are not necessarily sexual ones. It is even possible that an ideological commitment to a particular form of sexual behavior produces a desire for deviance.

Sadly, this is what we have to deal with in current age of WoW, when devs decided to make PvP a side game for someone other than PvPers. Now you only have hardcore rated pvpers(which few in numbers compared to other fields of WoW) + few casual pvpers here and there. They lost semi hardcore players like me when they removed power difference, pvp exclusive gear and progression system. I don really see any point of doing pvp anymore, because everyone is same in terms of power and rewards are lackluster and full of RNG.

As the story goes, famed cyclist Lance Armstrong not only beat cancer, but used it to his advantage. Following his near miraculous survival of testicular cancer, in 1998 Armstrong returned to cycling with a vengeance. He had been a rising cycling star before the diagnosis, but now he seemed unstoppable. Had cancer transformed him into some sort of superman? In a sense, yes. Pre cancer, Armstrong had been weighed down by several extra kilos of upper body mass. It wasn't fat   he was just a muscular guy. Still, the extra weight was a burden, and since it was in the upper body, it didn't help him move the pedals any faster. On hill climbs Armstrong had been vulnerable to falling behind smaller, leaner cyclists. But now, Armstrong's post chemotherapy emaciation was his new upper hand, and it was what helped propel him to seven consecutive Tour de France wins [source: Carmichael].

A lot of people are talking about how they probably changed their diet intentionally either to feel good about their workout or to match the fact that they are exercising. Whether they are right, I'm not sure, but last summer, I went from non active to running a few miles every other day and I wasn't focusing on my diet, but I did notice that I craved more healthy foods and was more avoidant of unhealthy foods. This wasn't a diet I was trying, it was just what I suddenly started wanting. I'm 20, btw.

I continued to lose money and had a particularly bad month. I was down to about 10k. One of my roommates had been suggesting for months that I keep some empty heads up tables open while I played 6 max and if anyone sat me, to play them and that it would definitely be easier than playing only 6 max. I had been unwilling to do that because I thought HU was harder and I was already losing so much, I didn want to risk trying to learn a new game and lose even faster. I had no choice now, though. I was desperate and I needed to do something, anything at all.

They want an excuse for shitty behavior. That is literally all God is for them.

In this world, we'll experience a reality forged from the physical world around us and the digital world we create to exist on top of it. We'll be able to view this world dozens of different ways.

Even if we decide that altering ourselves is ethically questionable, we can achieve a similar effect just by building display capabilities into a pair of glasses.

However, the Greens spokesperson for gambling harm Justin Field said thecap didn't go far enough. "Any pokies plan that fails to rapidly reduce the total number of machines in NSW continues to lock in increasing harm to people and communities," he said.

But MrToole said the reforms were the "most significant changes to gambling regulation in NSW for a decade".

The sub is what it is. When I first came on as mod I was passionate about making this a welcome place for everyone and particularly more welcoming for Koreans than it had been, but over time I realized this wasn possible to enforce in an even remotely consistent fashion. I think we done better than before by stating the rules and enforcing them as objectively as we can. Again not perfectly, as long as humans are involved in moderation it can never be truly objective, but we have have a doubt or question we discuss amongst ourselves and try to come an agreement, which is what happened here. I know there are a lot of complaints about the sub, but again I think that more due to the person making the complaints mindset.

If you're a biker, the best location for your man cave may well be your garage. There's no reason you can't spruce it up with an orange and black color scheme and some sweet flame detailing on the walls. You might not want (or have room for) a huge TV and couch in there, but you could certainly fit a bar and some stools into a corner for when you need a break from tinkering with your hog. If there's a reason why you can't deck out your garage, you can still work the biker look into your man cave in the basement or spare room. Again, orange and black is the way to go, and flames are always a plus   you may want to stock up on "American Chopper" DVDs while you're at it.
