Turn I hesitant to comment. I don have a lot of small bets in my turn range even though I know PIO likes them in a lot of spots like this where the A peels off on the turn. I have a hard enough time executing 2/3 accurately. I will say this hand and JQs should for sure be barreling turn.

JTs and JQs not only have equity by drawing to essentially the nuts, they also block our opponents strongest Ax and Kx which make them great candidates to triple off.

Think that something from the tribe perspective that still needs to be reviewed, Allen said of the Senate bill. concern, separate from the compact, is that outside influences coming into the state of Florida, non regulated, is something that we don believe is good for the industry in general. I think that that language is something that we have to work through with the state. Much of the controversy concerning the games has centered on companies that paid cardroom operators as much as $100,000 to be a player, which acts as bank. The companies then hire workers to act as but videos of the employees showed that they were sometimes absent from the card table while the games were being conducted. The Senate proposal would require the companies and employees to be licensed by the state, while the House proposal (HB 7067) includes an outright ban on cardroom operators offering the games. Legislative action is needed for the tracks to add slots.

We can argue whether or not it is in America's best interests to decrease its influence around the globe another time. I personally think it's a horrible decision to decrease influence, especially with Russian and Chinese spending and investment in the Middle East and Africa increasing their influence.

It also does a lot of interesting things with mental health (npcs, especially Lucatiel), and Buddhism (daughters of Manus, with a big gold star for Nashandra), and I get a lot out of pondering the importance and meaning behind that stuff.People_Are_Savages  3 points  submitted 1 month agofor people who aren familiar with buddhism, the primary belief is this: all suffering in the world comes from desire, the wanting of things you don or can have, and by reducing and eliminating desire you can reduce both the suffering you experience and the suffering inflicted on the world around youNashandra is explicitly a being of "want", and many of her actions increase the suffering of others (and herself) as the cost of obtaining her desires.At the simple end of that concept, she manipulates Vendrick into crossing the sea to make war on the giants for reasons that are not explicit, described vaguely as taking something from them; it not revealed what that thing is, but the result was conflict and death, an eventual revenge attack on Drangleic, and contributing to the divide between herself and Vendrick that eventually would lead him to put a plan in place to stop her from accomplishing her goals.On a wider story level, her ultimate goal seems to be gaining access to the Throne of Want, which is strongly implied to be the Kiln of the First Flame.

This geographical aspect raises another possibility for the seeming lack of Celtic influence on English vocabulary; it may be possible that Old English speakers first came into contact with people who spoke a very Latinized "Lowland" dialect of Celtic that was distinct from what been described as "Highland" British Celtic, the parent language of modern Welsh, Breton Cornish, if Celtic languages were even present in the south east of England at all. Indeed, it seems likely that before the arrival of Old English, Latin developed in that area of England in much the same way it also did in Gaul, becoming widely adopted with Celtic dialects being spoken only in very marginal spaces..

Since poker became the "big game" in Las Vegas, many people are buying chips for home play. An interesting way to do it is to literally buy them from the casino and take them home with you. Use them for your home games, and if you ever stop playing, or need the money, cash them back in at the casino you got them from for full value. Don't worry about the changes a casino may make, or even the possibility of a casino being sold or closed down. This would only make your Las Vegas casino poker chips even more valuable

Her jungling is slow and inefficient, and the common consensus seems to be that she doesn even begin to become a champion until level 11.Her winrates are as expected in an early game meta   46% winrate in toplane seems to be the best place to "hide" Kayle   Whereas 41 42% In the mid/jungle seem as if she is ineffective there at best.However, her late game ramp is absurd   Once she hits 16, regardless of how many times she has fed or done poorly, she is an unstoppable force and will almost certainly win the game.This makes her feel very bad both to play as, and to play against, because regardless of the Kayle player skill, if you ever hit level 16 and have not won the game against her, you are almost guaranteed to lose, and if you are laning as her, you are a helpless, muling kitten.Will anything be done to make Kayle a little more bearable to lane with, possibly by taking away some of the unstoppable late game power? I feel the champion should feel good to play at all stages of the game, not simply hoping you can "survive until level 11" and rely on your teammates to carry you like an anchor until that point.LeagueOfMeta was quite a different place years ago.

Your pets rely completely on you for quality of life and what he did was put his own emotions over the suffering of his pet.

At the same time, Jellico was in an unenviable situation too. He had to fill a seat on the most advanced ship in the fleet, on very short notice, and he had reason to believe war was going to break out in his sector. The weight of the world must have been on his shoulders, I doubt he felt he had time to get to know the crew and bring them along slowly, he felt he had to get them into fighting shape after years of very cushy diplomatic and scientific duty..

When Lyndon Johnson found out that his Chief of Staff Walter Jenkins had been caught having sex with another man at the YMCA bathroom down the street from the White House, he knew his longtime friend and comrade had to go. As Lee Edelman points out in an essay about the Jenkins affair, "Tearooms and Sympathy: An Epistemology of the Water Closet," having gay sex meant certain death for a political career because having gay sex meant vulnerability and breached borders and that the Soviets would invade any minute. This was all the more true since Jenkins was the receptive partner in the exchange and his lover was "foreign born.".

The last great public expression of shame, I think, was in 1995, when actor Hugh Grant went on Tonight Show to express his deep mortification for, of all things, getting caught with a hooker. It seems such a quaint offense in our era of real sex scandals, ones that now include assault, rape, human trafficking rings and pedophilia   yet such was the threat to Grant's rising career that he had to ask the American public for forgiveness.

The first step to identifying authentic casino poker chips is to know and understand as much as you possibly can about the chips, and the casino that you have taken an interest in. While it is true that many casinos are owned by large scale companies, each one has a set of chips that is specific and unique to them. This is basically due to the fact that there is a certain amount of funding per casino that backs each chip that is part of that casino. This is why most casinos do not honor chips that have been issued at other casinos. There are rare exceptions to this rule, and casinos in Nevada, Las Vegas are generally the exception.

You get a delta because I am now realizing my ideas of what strong men look like are equally distorted, based on the difference between bodybuilder muscularity and functional muscularity.

I switched from the Cascadias to Peregrines about a year ago and much prefer running on the road in the Peregrines. They are just so much lighter. On the trails, you do go through pairs faster (as stated above, the Cascadias are beasts and can go a many miles between pairs). That said, i haven noticed any major shift in my trail approach with the Peregrines even though they are a more minimalist shoe. They have a solid enough rock plate, just not the major "cushiony" ride you get with Cascadias.

I have a question, rumor is that Above and Beyond and/or Seven Lions will be here because anjunabeats has a stage. However, on the same day, anjunabeats also has a show in New York. On top of that, some anjunabeats artists (Mat Zo, Ilan Bluestone) are already at sunset. Doesn this mean it more likely that A and Seven Lions will be in New York, while the others are in Florida?

When you fully love yourself and embrace vitality, and really live your life, you are being the best father figure you can be for your children. If you set an example that you are someone who denies reality and lets themselves get walked all over, you are skewing your children chances at having a clear "reality meter" in life. They already see reality between you and your wife, whether thats consciously or subconsciously, so if you do nothing about it, it can really start to mess with their ability to know what reality is and what taking the right action in life is, when they face situations in the future where they are either being mis treated, neglected etc.

But Russia couldn care less if a Russian joins the church. What at question is the method. Proselyting is outlawed and they sticklers about it.

And they don If someone wonders in the chapel and starts asking questions, then the missionaries have full rights to jabber away. If another member invites a friend to church, no problem. But absolutely no proselyting!

I'm the female with ADHD in my relationship. I feel like I have different struggles because men are "allowed" to be the messy ones, and women traditionally have always taken on more housework. I feel like it's somehow more ok for men to have ADHD and struggle with the typical symptoms. I'll never be a housewifey type of person, I'll never have enough tact to not occasionally interrupt, and I'll never be able to keep organized or avoid racking up tardiness at work because I lost my keys again. Most of the men I've dated, including my current boyfriend of 3(!) years, have a lot of trouble coming to terms with this and it does cause issues. He doesn't think I'll be able to raise kids with him someday because "I can't even keep my medication bottle out of reach from the dogs, how am I going to be able to keep a kid safe?"

They ship everything in those big, obvious boxes so there a higher than normal chance that customs agents will spot it and you have to pay more before it can be delivered.

Whatever you read, don just read some fantasy novel or some book someone recently read that was "pretty good" or whatever. What I think will actually get you out of your rut might need to be something utterly masterful, where after reading a passage you recognize it one of the most beautifully written things you read in your life. That where you get inspiration from literature. Not simply from cool concepts or action scenes, but from great prose.

Lastly, with regards to OSHA, the exact policies that an employer follows regarding drug testing is not a required track, but rather a set of limitations. It not that OSHA says no drugs allowed and you must test for these drugs amongst your employees, but rather, you must follow safety procedures, such as being in control of your faculties when operating certain equipment.
