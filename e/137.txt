Also are you really actually concerned about how much time your husband is spending playing poker online or is your real concern the sexual nature of the chat that is happening at the poker room site?

If he does not agree to stop the chatting then he doesn't deserve your worry in the first place.

An inherent error in the model design could cause a bias that leads to more people from a particular Hispanic neighborhood being arrested. This has already happened.

In truth, the functions of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are not so straightforward, but this is a useful rule of thumb.[1][2]There are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system; pre  and post  ganglionic.

My best friend, 20, is a delusional 'artist' who needs to grow up. IMO, a best friend is someone who supports you and puts up with your shit. If you are doing anything that is egregiously bad, they will try to talk some sense into you   but love you through the ups and downs. Your friend is 20. That is a kid. However, you don know their potential and you don know whether they will be successful. It not sunshine and rainbow worlds that make people succeed in an arts based career. Also, pretty much anyone who has ever made it against the odds will tell you that you have to try. I can imagine telling someone to grow up, get real and accept they will never succeed as an artist at 20 years old. If you read up on successful contemporary artists   most did not taste any success until late 20s or 30s. Very few people have even come into their own at 20   they are still finding their "voice". All this aside, why are you so critical of someone who is supposed to be your best friend? This isn your BF or GF or spouse. You are not supporting them financially.

Free Cubs tickets and half day Fridays might seem like a scene out of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," but it is a way of life at Chicago based digital marketing agency Be Found Online.

I had that problem so I created a range of + 7 sec on the goal pace so I would have a 15 second buffer range. This worked well for all 18 weeks of my marathon training plan. The better the GPS signal, the better your alerts will behave. Also, terrain matters. Its harder to maintain goal pace on an incline or decline since you tend to slow or speed up. Effort is harder or easier hence the grade adjusted pace strava will report. Intervals were difficult to dial in but with some practice, it didn buzz too much.

This might be common sense, but a lot of being adaptable and ever growing has a lot to do with the internal relationship with ourselves, especially when it comes to emotional intelligence. Perhaps a way to deepen the RPWs topics is to think more about how to properly grow and strengthens ourselves from the inside. Things like developing emotional intelligence, learning to see through our own bs by developing integrity, and stabilizing core values of being loving to the world by first being loving towards ourselves. It takes smart women to really navigate new obstacles in a graceful way, so maybe something that we could focus on more is becoming smarter.

Some people approach credit like a poker game, with the mentality that you can lose money if you don play your cards. Although it always advisable to pay off your bill in full every month to avoid interest charges, not using credit cards at all can actually backfire when it comes to your credit score. If an issuer looks at your account and sees that there hasn't been any activity for a while (how long varies, but more than a year is a good rule of thumb), they might close it. Losing that credit line hurts your utilization ratio, which can hurt your credit score. Lohrenz suggests charging a small amount regularly   maybe a recurring bill like a gym membership or Netflix subscription   and paying it off every month. Some issuers will let you set up automatic payments from your checking account, so you won't forget to make those payments.

TIL that a supermarket was closed down so that Michael Jackson could fulfill his dream to go to a supermarket and shop like everybody else and experience what it was like to "put things in a basket." It was populated with his friends and family pretending to be fellow shoppers and employees. Michael wanted to be normal, Antoinette and her friends wanted to pretend to be "the peasants they saw out the window". But Michael actually wanted to BE normal and HAVE that normalcy, while Antoinette lot wanted a chance to carry milk churns made of gold (seriously, she had milk churns made of gold to be "suitable" for her to carry) and have a few hours pretending to be "noble peasants".

From stated metaphors like Romero Night of the Living Dead, to meta farces like Wheedon Cabin in the Woods, it is generally agreed that successful horror movies are successful because they tap into something cultural at the time (though still debated (I have a great video on this subject for the movie Halloween, but the source is not scholarly and I rather not risk things with the mods more than I have already, but PM if you interested)). With that in mind, I would like to highlight that, if not self evident, The Twilight Zone is a horror series that frames itself in fantasy and science fiction.A lot of the social commentary found in The Twilight Zone was not original to The Twilight Zone.

These sorts of things aren really tax breaks for corporations in the final analysis. Burger King "sells" these shamrocks to customers and therefore receives income that is otherwise taxable. Burger King then makes a donation equal to the amount of shamrock sales they made, and this contribution is considered tax deductible.

1V into 1 delivers 1W. 2V into 1 delivers 4W. 1V into 1 plus another 1V into another 1 (with a common terminal) may total 2V, but they deliver 2W, not 4W.

Il a expliqu qu'tre cuisinier, cela venait du coeur et du ventre et que tant qu'il n'avait pas compris cela, dans ses premires annes de chef, sa cuisine n'tait pas vraiment intressante.

Hi there   we happy to approve your question related to your novel, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists, based on past experience: some aspiring novelists have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it not always what you want to hear..

Gaga has many tattoos and gets new ones often. She was below the legal age of 18 to get a tattoo in her home state of New York so she used a fake ID.

This is why LSD can be such a potent tool for understanding yourself, your past, your fears and desires, your mistakes, and so forth.

When you come across a poker chip that is heavy, you can bet that this is a highly durable chip! Many who play poker, play in casinos, or are considered to be professionals in the gaming industry agree that when a chip has more weight to it, it is more durable than the lighter chips.

While it's true adults are less vulnerable than children (I'm aware 18 is adulthood, thanks!), that doesn't make anything done to them completely acceptable. I don't want anyone to think that if a professor or boss comes to them and says "hey, your grade is slipping/your job is in danger, but you can make it up to me" through sex that a) that's in anyway acceptable for someone with power over them to do and b) that they have no options to get that abuse of power to stop.
