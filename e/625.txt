I fell in love with Erkin Koray immediately when I saw this video of him performing the song Cemalim, his hypnotic vocals, the dusty psychedelic sound, his laid back swagger. The google store has this album listed as Mesafeler and it apparently short a song that on the original cut (digital age woes) and it seems to be the only album on there that mostly complete, then it just compilations, which is frustrating, but anyways. The man is a pretty significant discovery for me, music 70s psychedelic music from Turkey has no choice but to be interesting, and he brings a seamless blend of Turkish folk with psychedelic rock.

But this justification won stretch any further. People that develop nonfree software, even software with malicious functionalities, often try to excuse this on the grounds that they fund some development of free software. However, a business that is basically wrong can be legitimized by spending some of the profits on a worthy cause. For instance, some (not all) of the activities of the Gates Foundation are laudable, but they don excuse Bill Gates career, or Microsoft. If the business works directly against the worthy cause it tries to legitimize itself with, that is a self contradiction and it undermines the cause.

To the casual passenger, any airport can be a veritable hellmouth. The food sucks, the people who work there are unfriendly due to the soul sucking nature of working at a goddamn airport, the price of a beer makes Rupert Murdoch go, "Whoa." In an environment like this, a single canceled flight can send you screeching head first into madness. So, really, it's no surprise that there are airport themed conspiracy theories. What is surprising, however, is that almost all of them focus on a single place: Denver International Airport. The site is a hotspot for various, usually New World Order themed conspiracy theories that basically paint the place as a thinly veiled front for a massive murder factory fueled by the Illuminati Nazi devil. These are based on its supposedly swastika shaped runway layout ."Hey, Bob, look! There's a where they've vanquished that war demon and everyone lives happily ever after!"

It keeps the rats out of his crops and grains. Even then, they don adopt out barn cats in the winter, and that in the deep south where it doesn freeze often.

And then would the Queen be allowed to appear in a lovely aqua marine frock with some costume jewelry looking broach and address the young people of the Commonwealth? God save the Queen..

Great weekend, couldn have planned it near as smoothly without all the bits and pieces of information y offered!. 
Ciara GalvinIT was an evening you wouldn't send the dog out in, but off we trekked to the cinema for Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. With the rain pelting outside, we settled into our seats along with the eight other cinema goers and we put on our 3D glasses.I was looking forward to the second cinematic instalment of Frank Miller's graphic novels. 
But Foucault forgot to mention the other secret of modernity: violence. Violence is that which we moderns supposedly do not engage in. Someone upsets us, we do not shoot them or beat them or kill them. 
Someone with a questionable conscience could do exactly what you do, but for a much lower price; so people vote with their wallets.. 
I 100% believe his explanation, but it's helpful to see another guy articulate the same sentiment as my boyfriend about how he views porn.

Well. Hmmm. There was a certain point on the 'come down' from the sheer 'pain' of the chilie peppers, which was a kinda pleasuriable pain. 
Hey everyone, please delete if not allowed :) I have a friend who joined the gym about a year ago and he used to be quite skinny, but now he has gained a fair amount of muscle. We went out for breakfast and he ordered two sets of individual pancake meals. He also just eats a lot of whatever, even if it's not necessarily good for him. 
Bellamy original version was non secular, and, just like the Constitution2 and all of its Amendments, did not mention the word "God". The Declaration of Independence uses the word once, in the phrase "Nature God".) This does not mean that the Founding Fathers were a religious hardly so. 
As I keep saying, it's all too easy to spin fiction here. The falsehoods are far more fun (if only because clandestine conspiracies are more interesting than the mundane truth), and as such, they keep repeated and augmented until such time as users who have the right intention   like you, for instance, who want to be open minded   wind up weaving them in to what precious few facts might actually be present.
Ohh that poor coyote that ate those dozens of baby bunnies alive.

Alright, it looks like you have a few things you misunderstanding. they bet 100k, you go all in for 90k, they get their 10k back and 180k will be in the pot. Second, even if your opponents have 10s of millions in their account, only the amount that is on the table can be bet in a single hand, which will likely be the table cap. I took a look at WSOP and it looks like their lowest stake is now 5k/10k, which is kind of unfortunate; I know they used to have much lower stakes. So in that case, you basically be relying on luck to get a decent starting stack. I recommend just sitting down at a table with whatever amount you have, wait until you get dealt AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or AK, then go all in preflop. Hopefully that gets you a few more chips to play with. 10k was variance and 5k was punting. At the time it was over half my bankroll and I was considering quitting and throwing in the towel. Ended up getting back on a stake and played full time for the next 6 months and made it all back plus like 50k by the end of the year. Honestly it was really good for me overall as a player since I had never actually worked hard at poker before then. But seeing that alternate timeline where I give up and get a job at McDonald again become so close to reality was enough to push me. I never let it get that close again that for fucking sure.

Last night, I was cleaning house in poker until some old guy with a grey mustache comes in. After about 30 minutes, it only the two of us playing. He calling every bluff, talking all kinds of trash and we going back and forth.

But at a City of Hope charity poker tournament in Ingelwood, Calif. July 29, Khloe Kardashian and Kendall Jenner's appraisal of Kim Kardashian's 5 foot 3 figure was so effusive that the social media loving star simply had to document it for her Instagram stories, eating up their remarks while half heartedly protesting that 119 pound was "not that skinny." No, of course her arms were not the size of Khloe's pinky, she demurred, and it's simply ridiculous to suggest she was the same size as Kendall's can only fit a phone and lipstick purse..

I am 100% sure that even women with "perfect" bodies have random "flaws" that they obsess over. Victoria Secret models still Facetune their Instagram photos for heavens sake!

When the contractors come to fix that old sheet rock next month it's going to be a serious problem". Yeah sure, you're right he tells me, I really thought he would do it. Well this fuckin miser goes out and buys 2 tubs of holy candle wax instead and tells us to just dip our heads in it. He goes "It works fine, we just don't have the budget to replace all the shelves right now". I swear to god I'm going to take that Evangelist gig in the settlement I can't take it anymore.

However this is an incredibly big plot point, and the main driving force in his character arc and story as a whole, as there's a point where Edmond Dantes realizes that he actually had gone way too far in the name of vengeance and lost his humanity.

In some ways his most extreme work comes from this aberrant moment of peinture vache (stupid painting), as he called it   it's as though, in parodying other Belgian artists (Ensor, and a particularly gross comic illustrator named Deladoes), he touched a demotic rock bottom from which he could only recoil in the end. But Georgette hated the new style, and by 1950 Rene was back to the old one, often repainting versions of images he had first made in the '30s. This recycling fitted his own idea of himself as a craftsman rather than an artist. You could make more than one chair to the same pattern.

Enforce your boundaries and stand your ground. Tell them straight up, "Please stop making these jokes about my husband. It's disrespectful and if you continue to do so, then we will go no contact for a week." And then follow through with it. Add another week if they try to skirt around the issue and continue disrespecting your husband. You have to show that their actions have consequences and that you and your husband are a united team, and you're putting both of you first.

I was really surprised by the reaction of my family. It is like they don't believe it. Despite all the health problems we all have (mine being the worst of us alive now) and the early heart related deaths of males in our family, they all get quiet when I talk about it like they don't believe me. I am the youngest of the kids and everyone always treated me like I was a whiner and was faking illnesses. Maybe they would feel guilty if they actually accepted that I have a real illness, so that is why they can't allow themselves to believe the diagnosis. No one else in my family has gone to a geneticist for testing despite having symptoms.

Look they told them to stretch the food in last hand out. Also i dont get how many of you call everything an asspull. If war was done by the numbers everytime you would know the result before the fight even starts. I am no expert myself but a lot of you act like you have studied humans and history for years and believe that there is no chance something like that would ever happen. Personaly i believe that when someone is pushed in a corner without anywhere to go they will give everything to survive. And i am sure there are a lot of historic cases that prove that. Anyway at the end of the day its fiction and not a 1:1 representation of the events so some leniency is allowed

I don't think the problem is so much that it didn't make realistic sense, but that it somewhat undercut the tension of the scene (Bathos). Its a very marvel esque wink at the audience technique, which made the movie feel more similar to the movies being made now than the star wars movies that had come before which is a bit of a problem, since presumably the universe itself hasn't changed. That was kinda my problem with the movie JJ obviously loves star wars given that he made every effort to include all the aesthetic and surface level details of the OT (stormtroopers, a rebellion, ect), but the tone, direction, cinematography, writing, ect.

Another study of 497 Dutch adolescents and their mothers, also published in 2011 in the journal Emotion, found that 47.8 percent of the subjects were unaffected by the weather, and that 16.8 percent were summer lovers who reacted positively to warm sunny weather, while 26.8 percent were summer haters and 8.7 percent were rain haters, who were measurably angrier and less happy on days with more precipitation. On sunny days, in contrast, the rain haters were happier and less angry, though still fearful. "So, the total group of people who didn't like the rain was about 25 percent of the sample. The main difference between the rain haters and summer lovers was that rain haters didn't react as strongly to a lack of sun and low temperatures as summer lovers did, whereas summer lovers didn't react as strongly to the rain as the rain haters did."

Its a little difficult to think of Ellsworth Kelly, Jacques Villon, Grant Wood, Laslo Moholy Nagy and Thomas Hart Benton as painters for war. But its true, and true for many of hundreds of other artists in the 1915 1918 era. Its not as though they were in the trenches gunning down the enemy or lobbing hand grenades into the swirling gunsmoke. They were camouflage1 artists employed as magicians, Wartime Magi, employed/drafted to make ships and such disappear. since it was (sort of) first noticed in 1915 that designs odd to the environment, stark geometric patterns and such, were capable of fooling the eye, people with design capacity were pressed into service, rendering offensive and defensive instruments of war optically semi impervious with variations of the then five year old modern nonrepresentational art. That must been a very odd position to wake up to every morning. course the idea of camouflage in the animal world is probably 250 million years old animals and insects have been blending into their environment for eons, and I sure too that early hominids did their fair share of walking behind brush.

Things that work for me: hip length (shorter than some people hip length) fitted tees/tops with wide legged pants, long cardis with skinny jeans/pants, maxi dresses with an empire waist that are fitted in the bust and flow under that, and swing tanks that are fitted in the bust. The swing tanks have to hit at my hip bone or they just look weird on me, but they somehow look fantastic with blazers and jeans.

The irritating conversation with Broome wore on and I told him about the ovarian reading tried on me by Serge Benhayon, and the grim excorcistic mind fuck that went on at the Sacred Esoteric healing workshop. I told him I submitted complaints to the NSW HCCC. Hamish mumbled and said really a lot. Again I asked if he was sure he didn know anyone associated with UM and I directed him to the Naming Names page on my Accountability blog.

During the Bush years, when war became peace, lies became truth, greed was good and evil was necessary, I fantasized that Dubbya would be impeached and that his evil puppet master Dick Cheney would actually go to jail for crimes against humanity. 
Had we followed our policy, this would have never happened. I can assure you that we have our property thoroughly covered with pest control services, however, even when we do everything perfect, with ground level properties in Florida, it is a constant effort.

 Definitely shower but I find that wet hair is hard to work on if you want a scalp massage. We don really care about hairy legs or armpits but it makes the flow of the massage a bit better if it hairless. Sucks to work on really hairy dudes but oh well.

Miss me with that BS. She is tremendously rude to people that ask her questions trying to understand what's going on.

Let me tell you, u/anon2777 why I play poker. It's not the moment when that board runs out just so clean. It's not the A that came on the turn or the Q that fell on the river.

This also results in normalization of the undeveloped immune system that is present in germ free mice. When adult germ free mice were colonized with normal bacteria, they continued to show reduced anxiety like behaviors, suggesting that the absence of gut bacteria early in development has a permanent effect on the brain wiring related to anxiety and exploratory behavior.14, 16In contrast, when germ free mice were colonized early in life as pups or during adolescence and then tested in adulthood, normal anxiety like behavior was observed,13, 15 suggesting that microbiota influence the way the brain is wired early in development.17In addition to studying mice, researchers have used antibiotic treatment to manipulate gut bacteria. Exposure to antibiotics in drinking water has been shown to lead to reduced numbers of gut bacteria in mice and to a reduction in the diversity of the bacterial population.18 Consistent with work in germ free mice, mice exposed to antibiotics for a single week showed increased exploratory behavior and reduced anxiety like behavior, an observation that was linked to changes in the bacterial profile.19 Two weeks following the end of the antibiotic treatment, both the bacterial profile and the behavior returned to normal, suggesting that transient changes in gut microbiota can influence behavior.19Having established connections among gut bacteria, the brain, and behavior, it is intriguing to consider the ways that microbiota may communicate with the brain.

Yes, it's absolutely biased. The article's merit isn't in its ability to make sure it balances mean things said about Shapiro with nice things. It's merit lies in the arguments, logic, and FACTS sites throughout. Furthermore, if bias is something that allows a conscious observer to immediately dismiss an article, literally everything Shapiro has ever touched is immediately dismissible.

Set upon a hilltop overlooking California rugged Central Coast, Hearst Castle was once the extraordinary estate of legendary media mogul William Randolph Hearst, the founder of what now known as Hearst Communications. Designed by acclaimed American architect Julia Morgan and constructed between 1919 and 1947, the enormous Spanish revival property features several notable structures, but none more important and more recognizable than Casa Grande, the soaring, cathedral like twin towered structure that served as Hearst principal residence. This elaborate mansion holds 38 bedrooms, 30 fireplaces, 42 bathrooms and 14 sitting rooms across 68,500 square feet and visitors are able to view portions of the home through one or more of the available tours. Shortly after Hearst death in 1951, the property was donated by the then Hearst Corporation and is now managed by the California State Parks as part of the San Simeon State Historical Monument. Located off of Highway 1 about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles near the city of San Simeon, the majority of visitors must take Highway 1 (Pacific Coast Highway), then Highway 46 towards Cambria to Hearst Castle Road, as a significant portion of Highway 1 from the north is currently inaccessible. While no lodging is available at Hearst Castle, a number of hotels can be found in San Simeon and Cambria, such as Blue Dolphin Inn, Cavalier Oceanfront Resort and the Morgan.

They at first had first to their date, but as I kindly and politely explained our situation and that the $65 repair plus shipping was as much as a new one and they were very nice and paid for expedited shipping both ways and repaired for free. I didn't even have to prove it was a recent purchase or anything. Their customer service was top notch. I've had similar experiences with LEGO when my dog ate a lego man.
