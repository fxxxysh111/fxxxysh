That would of course be an odd thing to do, given that Republicans, who had a 100 year history of opposition to slavery, support for the civil rights of black Americans, efforts to pass anti lynching bills, opposition to Jim Crow laws   efforts to disband the Ku Klux Klan. The GOP even voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act with much larger majorities than Democratics. Why would racists and segregationist Democratics now become Republicans?

Hand 5: I honestly thought about checking this back on the river; on the turn I was hoping he had A5 or A4 so I didn't think the river was too great for us. But I try to keep myself from thinking shit like "well this is the worst full house I can have so I have to check", especially considering the stack size. I shove, he tanks for a solid two minutes so I'm positive I'm good and he finally sighs, throws his stack in, says "AQ is good" and shows me A5

Okay this is all not just coincidences anymore. The shredder company showing up right as Seungri was talking with police was already shady enough, but it could have just been an ill timed coincidence. could have been. But now this? Nah it just is too much that they want us to buy, too much they want us to believe. And why should we believe it? YG is a pathological liar and anyone would have to be completely naive to imagine that he couldn be personally involved here, none the less completely clean of any illegal activity overall. He already lied and said that the texts of Seungri don exist, oya so what does the Anti Corruption commission have in their possession right now Yang? And I don think that Seungri has enough power to have the police in his pocket the way he does by himself, as well as all the other criminal connections. Its far more likely that YG is behind him and that Seungri is working with YG associates.

In all seriousness though, investing more time into a game long term would yield more money in the end, and for us on the consumer side it makes much more "obvious sense."

Salt Lake City zoning only allows massage parlors that are NOT connected to a medical use to be placed within a specific area called a commercial corrdior. In SLC proper, those areas are restricted to between main street and state street, between 900 south and 2100 south.

The poles are relatively easy to establish: the literal camp would have believed in the gods. These stories make claims to be inspired by the muses, who witnessed the events and ostensibly use the bards as mouthpieces. The word "mmemnonai" is a storytelling word which means "I remember" but really "I remember exactly." (My Ancient Greek is weak, so please pardon my lack of a Greek keyboard, and my almost certain misspelling of the transliteration.) So for uncritical readers or devoutly religious ones, they probably would have understood it as literal. It may be that such readers were the majority.
According to Blume, getting the best price in each individual trade is not necessarily every trader top priority.

Honestly, and this is a thing that would pissed me off five years ago: time. In our early twenties my husband and I were happy with us and our dogs and our home, our goals and our adventures, and were sure we never wanted a baby. Then in our later twenties that opinion softened and at 29 I woke up one day and said "I been thinking for a long time and I think I might want to have a baby" and he said "oh thank god me too and I didn know how to tell you." Now we have a toddler and we have lost absolutely nothing (well, a few hundred dollars in baby gear and a bit of sleep) and gained a family member. It was right for us.

In 2008 and the first part of 2009, 32 greyhounds died or were euthanized. The track's vet, Dr. Lisa Robinson, quit keeping data on outcomes in May 2009. She did not respond to requests for an interview by the Times, so this reporter used the GREY2K's figures to extrapolate how many dogs may have been euthanized. In 2008, the percentage of injured dogs (182) that had to be euthanized (27) was about 15 percent. If 15 percent of the 452 dogs injured since 2008 had to be put down, that would mean 67 greyhounds were euthanized over four years.

Regular veterinary visits. When you take your dog in each year for his veterinary exam, the vet doesn't just give him some vaccinations and send him on his way. He does a thorough exam: palpating the body to make sure all the internal organs feel normal and there are no worrisome lumps or bumps; checking the condition of the eyes and ears; listening to the heart and lungs; checking the weight; and taking the temperature. Because dogs age differently than people, this annual physical is comparable to you having a physical exam every five or six years. This is especially important if your dog is middle aged or older because it gives the veterinarian a chance to find and treat health problems before they become serious.

And the more you develop this mindset, the less you be bothered about each incident. And as a bonus, you use the power of your mind, the instinctual way it integrates unconscious experience and changes how you react to these situations (social in this case).

I don think anyone thinks Trump tax returns are truthful and accurate. That the point. Michael Cohen pointed out in his testimony that the reason he thinks Trump doesn want his tax returns in the public is that it would give tax experts a chance to go over them with a fine toothed comb and find out all of the shady tax dodge schemes he been involved in. That would have been an interesting outcome.

And those other people are not, of course, as fully human as "people like us." And so debating whether homosexuals should be executed becomes "good journalism." If the journalists at the BBC had stopped for a moment and asked "If I were queer, would I ask this question? How would it feel to be queer and know that if I lived in Uganda I could be killed for loving someone else?" then they know that killing people for the gender of the people they love is no different than killing people for the color of their skin or their religion. 
I agree completely. It feels like a fan made movie. It a cash in to appease a simple minded audience, because although the fans love to attribute great philosophical and social commentary to Star Wars (lol), what they actually love is when big space thing go boom and lasers go pew over and over and over and fucking over again.

The better option is to elect leaders that don pander to Fox News   if no more politicians went on the shows, if they couldn get access to press conferences   they lose credibility and viewers and dwindle away, or be seen as an opinion vs news.

Remove credibility and stop citing them, stop calling them news, and they stop being taken as fact.

In most countries the political class have for some time been running things in a manner totally contradictory to what the public desires. It seems most of you fear that direct democracy will enable populism but really it will kill populism, which is a result of large segments of society being politically excluded and compounded by the populists having no responsibility for anything. In Switzerland people have ownership in the system and are used to taking responsibility for their countries political affairs, and that why they vote for fiscally sensible budgets and don just demand to raise taxes on the rich to 140% and execute unpopular celebrities or something..

As for the players, who actually pays attention to the dealer making change and raking the pot? So long as they just shorting a white here and there, they can just say "Whoops" the few times someone calls them out and play it safe for a while whenever that player at the table. Hell, I wouldn even notice a green missing from a large pot as low as 1/3, and I definitely seen dealers be excused for forgetting there only 5 greens in a black before with a dismissive chuckle.. 
If she shows significant improvement in the areas of short striding, holding her head to the right, holding her tail to the left, and/or willingness to bear weight on the leg, then very likely you have a pain issue.

For the next part I made a screenshot to better explain what strategy I use. As soon as the Sire teleports me, I click at the spot under the number 1. Once I reached that spot, the Sire will have spawned a pool on the left that you avoid by running away. When you run back to the Sire, you won be hit by this pool either because it its 2 tiles on your left. Now when you run back to the sire to attack it again (number 2), it will spawn another pool that you avoid by simply running towards it. By following line 2 the tentacle next to Sire won be able to hit you.
