The Poker Run was originally an event bikers played out on their Harley, but over the years it has been borrowed by Boaters, Runners, Bicyclist, Car enthusiast and I'm sure by others. The concept of a Poker Run is to travel a course or route and while doing so pick up poker cards along the way. Each person makes a 5 card poker hand from the cards they collect with the best hand winning money or prize. The way this is carried out for bikers is; each biker travels the planed route, every few miles there is a checkpoint at which each biker must stop and pickup a poker card. There are 7 checkpoints with the 7th checkpoint being at the final destination. Once all riders have reached the end, the rider with the best 5 card poker hand wins a grand prize. There can be variations to the prize scheme but the idea is to award cash or merchandise prizes at the end.

If the store has their shit together they won mess up, but sometimes people do forget the cold stuff.

I find that my self care away from the poker table impacts my mental game at the table. Seems so obvious when I type it out. But it's still worth mentioning I think. My biggest opponent in poker is almost always myself. Fast fwd a few hours, this guy at the poker table called me an idiot after I beat him and I had to control my urge not to smash his face. Such a major contrast!! I guess md'ing that day just lit a fire under of those potent human emotions, like love and anger. My take on things tho is I'm not afraid of my feelings. As long as my actions are authentic and skillful (close call tho wth that poker douche nozzle), I just view my feelings wth a sense of curiosity as they arise and inevitably pass. Hope that's helpful.

What's the lesson? It could be that attendees crave more wide ranging discussions about timely topics. At the main stage CMOs from Ancestry, eBay and Cigna largely talked about their own campaigns. No one with a CMO title spoke on the second stage, where the line up included Ramsey simply riffing on eMarketer reports about topics including voice search and advertising trends for over the top and connected TVs. Kawaja's talk was actually called "Fire your CMO: Marketing's Future Will Not Resemble its Past," which he used to describe why traditional brands are falling behind direct to consumer startups like Airbnb and mattress seller Casper. Paskalis did not give a formal presentation; he just fielded questions from ANA executive Bill Duggan, including about how the bank hired a "brand safety officer" to help keep the bank's ads away from questionable online content.

If they can "win" with their position then they flip the board and they don lose. It has never once been a discussion because for that to happen they would have to have real talk. I swear it like they turn on that Fox news and say "Tell me what to be mad about now".Edit: Is there any chance we can get a law to ban propaganda and lies claiming to be news? The harm it caused alone should make an easy argument for it.

Cables, ink, and certain accessories are where all the money is at. That $10 2 pack of HDMI cable sounds like a great deal, but truth is it only cost the store 60 cents. When computer sales would happen, management would drill it into our heads to attach more accessories, attach the company antivirus software (which was an easy sell, the software was actually good and I have no problem selling something that is actually beneficial).. 
At the time, it gave great reward for time spent. The game was starting and ppl were getting a lot of useful stuff like megacrysts and megacytes to max out espers which was a big deal back then.

 104 points  submitted 3 days agoBrutus came from the Corgi and Dachshund Rescue in Wyoming. He was badly abused as a puppy, and he still has anxiety but he's worth every anxious moment. We pulled Barry from a county shelter in a small town called Collierville in Tennessee. We drove from Florida to Tennessee after work one night to be there the moment the shelter opened the next day, and we were able to pull him. I talked to the shelter's director a few days prior, and she was willing to hold on to him until we got there. She wanted him to go to someone that had experience with corgis. I'm still not sure how anyone could give up such a great little guy to a shelter. He's the best friend anyone could ask for. Barry is currently sitting on the couch next to me, and he never leaves my side.You just need to keep your eyes and ears open. Corgis rarely show up in shelters, and when they do, the staff will usually try to give them to a corgi rescue or an experienced corgi owner. So, it's best to reach out to corgi rescues in your area and get on their waiting list. Some rescues go out to puppy mills and talk the owners into surrendering their corgis and whatever litter they may have. Keep an eye on Craigslist in your area, too. You'd be surprised what pops up. I've driven to Atlanta and back just to grab a corgi that popped up on Craigslist. She was 6 and the owners decided they couldn't keep her anymore. she was previously an "outdoor dog," and I've never seen a pupper so happy to rub her body all over a couch.

But, in this modern and unarguably unsustainable economy, there is a strong correlation between the amount of money spent on something, and the CO2 emissions required to build that thing from scratch, with a few exceptions (buying a forest to preserve it, investing in steadily improving next generation solar and battery technologies). Even though this house is made of wood, it took a lot of oil to make it, and given the deciduous trees, a lot of coal and methane leaking "natural" gas is required to heat this house. 2 points  submitted 19 days ago
[Brison departure] left us two large challenges that could not be solved with one person. We needed a Nova Scotia minister and a Treasury Board chair with ministerial experience.

This is an unfortunate reality that I think will only continue unless something is done.That being said, you basically have to just keep reaching out to friends.

All biopics can be this way, but you do have to wonder, given Timoner's documentarian background, why she opted for a narrative feature. If it's because James Crump recently made a documentary about Mapplethorpe and Sam Wagstaff in 2007 (Black White + Gray), then the question becomes: Why make this movie at all?. 
Its not suicidal, but no. He faces Impeachment, not a criminal trial (yet) Neither Johnson nor Clinton appeared as witness at their impeachments or made such a statement, and neither do criminal defendants.

And yes, I do get the argument that there is only one or the other: If you support animal rights then you support them, no grey area. But in my experience morality does never work like that.

Further, what of the court system? How are criminal and civil matters resolved? Not that I can think of various ways a private enterprise could adapt that role, but once again where is their motivation to be fair, balanced, and impartial? There admittedly a lot of corruption in the court system now, but I just don see how privatization could possibly solve that.

What I use to tell my clients is that they need to get two white shirts and one blue shirt. Get a couple ties that match and a pocket square. That all you need. Even if it one shit, but changing the shirt/tie combo it will give you several different outfit choices. But going back to the white shirt, they get dirty and you find yourself wearing them often. White shirts are something you can wear day after day. Change the tie each day and you look fresh, not like you wearing the same damn shirt 5 days in arrow.

Experimental probability is the number of times some particular outcome occurred divided by the number of trials conducted. For instance, if you threw a coin ten times and got heads seven times, you could say that the experimental probability of heads was 0.7. The theoretical probability of throwing heads on a fair coin, for instance, is 0.5, but the experimental probability will only come close to that if you conduct a large number of trials.

In the bathtub, but not on a phone. You can set your tv up in the sink. I highly recommend leaving the hot water running in a very tiny stream, and wedging a toothbrush handle under the stopper so the tub drains slowly. That way, your water never gets cold so long as you move around from time to time. If you sit still, the water at your feet will get too hot and slowly cook you, but it better than shocking yourself when you inevitably fall asleep and drop your phone. 1 point  submitted 3 days ago

Color and its use and abuse is a very personal thing especially the "abuse" part. The pamphlet below (Views of the New York World Fair, 1939, and published that year) to me is certainly one of those entries in the history of the abuse of color, not so much that the colors used in it are odd together, but the saturation of color across the board leads to something like Splendorama hyper color. I not sure why the colors are like this they remind me of a color equivalent of a laboriously and not very good translation of a tech manual. It isn as though color printing was new in the publishing industry, as books had been printed in different colors besides black for at least 300 years by this time; even full color printing had been around for 120+ years, so it isn as though they were experimenting with the color equivalent of newly available typefaces in a 1985 word program. Color photography in books is brand new at this point, the wide scale use taking place this year, but these images are not photos, so I doubt that this had much of an effect on the creativity of the designer. was very adventurously used int he early sci fi pulps and monthlies, but that stuff was already being employed for two decades by this point so their newness in regard to publishing experimentation is not an issue. so far as sci fi and color in the movies goes, that also wasn an issue because it didn exist yet, as the first color film1 in that genre didn appear until Lesley Selander awful Flight to Mars (1951).

Still, I estimate that it only takes 10 15 minutes to do a full bath + claws + ears.We also keep their nails trimmed more often than we would a normal cat, since they can accidentally scratch themselves (or each other) due to the lack of furry armor.You can also clean them with coconut oil, if a full water bath is undesirable at the moment   plus, it great for their skin!chive_machine  4 points  submitted 2 years agoBathing tends to happen between once a week and once a month   in the dryer months, they seem to get less oil buildup on their skin, so they both need to be bathed less and are more prone to having dry skin issues if bathed too often.Sphynx vary pretty significantly on how much fur they have   there are some cats that have basically none (and their skin can feel kind of tacky to the touch), and there are some cats (particularly recent descendants of outcrosses) that are almost fully furred (although those can be shown).
