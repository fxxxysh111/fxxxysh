I could go through your comment point by point again, but I think we both know that it won't serve either of us. My evidence won't convince you, and your deductions are things I've already seen debunked a dozen times before.

Edit: when I was a student [2016 2017], I asked about pricing at a very large hospital that I was training at and it went something like this: CT of the abdomen pelvis was $4,000 and the cost of 1 vial of contrast was $500 and the radiologist fee was also $500. So $5,000 for a routine scan I do a bazillion times a week. A CTA head and neck (so a special scan we do to look at the blood vessels in your neck and brain, something very commonly ordered in stroke victims) was $7,000 PLUS the cost of the contrast and the radiologist fee. I remember a kid needed a CTA head and neck but they knew they couldn pay for it so they settled on just a CTA head. That was still $4,000, plus contrast and radiologist fees. WTF.

The reason parliamentary democracies have a bureaucratic machine that helps fill out positions like ambassadors is because parliamentary democracies are messy places where millions of different opinions converge. In foreign affairs, a professional corps of diplomats reduces the element of chance by producing an army of highly trained, poker faced operators whose bloodstream is resplendent with "national interest." You can go wrong with a Maleeha Lodhi, or a Wajid Shamsul Hasan or a Husain Haqqani. But you can't go wrong with civil servants you've never heard of. Why? Because nobody's heard of them. That's the point. And once they are done doing their job, nobody will hear from them again.

This article considers one strategy   called "tight" in poker and compares it with trading. In poker almost every table has a very tight player. They only open with aces suited or a high pair. This is a reasonable strategy and mostly these players make small profits or break even. They rarely make large gains though because other players know that once this tight player raises he has a good hand  and so everyone folds around them.

Despite the positive and sunshiny forecast for the future of kombucha, some well respected entities continue to urge caution. The same study pointed out that some people reported scattered adverse effects, such as nausea and dizziness after consuming kombucha, as well as some cases of poisoning possibly due to the unhygienic conditions under which the beverage was made. Further, kombucha is definitely discouraged among the pregnant and lactating crowd. As a result, the Mayo Clinic recommends avoiding kombucha tea altogether until it is studied more definitively.

First, I would like to state that it is clear from the research in this area that there is a correlation between cohabitation prior to marriage and divorce.

Buttermilk is a popular ingredient in desserts for meals that call for a lush finale, and that same quality makes it a perfect post coital reward, too. How? Try a buttermilk shower. The wonderful feeling of cool buttermilk poured over the body can be enough to start an encore. For the non kitchen savvy, heed this important tip: Do not, under any circumstances, microwave or heat the buttermilk much above room temperature; doing so will make it curdle. Speaking from experience, stinky clumps of curdled buttermilk is not the best way to put an end to the evening. It's more of a humorous end can be memorable too since we're speaking about romance here, leave the laughs for that special moment when you decide it's time to share your junior high school photos instead!

Oh my gosh. I mean, there are so many. I think sex trafficking is a pervasive issue in this country.

But sex trafficking happens every day in front of our faces. We're talking about kids who go to school every day and then are forced into selling their bodies at night.

Arbitrary or spiteful CPP decisions ignore the true value of the CPP. To quantify that value, consider that if someone is entitled to the maximum CPP at age 65 in 2019, they would need to have $277,075 in an RRSP earning 4 per cent per year to provide the same income to their life expectancy of age 90. This assumes the CPP rises each year at 2 per cent inflation, and that they earn a flat rate of return each year for their RRSP. Age 90 is the life expectancy for a 65 year old Canadian.

To be honest, most the books I read are centered on geopolitics and environmental policy as its the sector I looking to integrate, so most "pure" environmental literature I tend to go through are papers. That being said there are some very good, non scientist worded and friendly papers I highly recommend. (Once I get to work I link some below).. 
My niece is trying to remember the rules of a card game that involves inflicting various acts of sadism on whoever ends up holding a black Jack. Said sadistic acts are determined by the suits of cards somewhere in play   for example, a Diamond results in a punch, a Club results in a pinch, and so on. The only other thing that she can remember is that one of the black Jacks is removed from the deck before play commences, leaving just one.

In the present day, residents of the UK freely have access to hundreds of operators offering sports betting, casino, bingo, scratchcards and more and this is an important sector in terms of national revenue. So, it feels like a win win, the nation is profiting, and gamblers are spoilt for choice with high quality games. The convenience of online gambling is making it a hit.

There are so many variants and skill levels of poker, it makes it difficult to find a land based venue that is hosting a game appropriate for every player. Therefore online poker has thrived   the range of games can be accessed at all times of the day, and users compete against one another all around the world.

The possibility of a guerrilla war would be what worries me. Historically, the US has not fared well in those. I think the only guerrila style insurgency the US has every completely defeated was in the Philippines in the early 20th century. We were incredibly lucky after the Civil War and World War II that the militaries of the Confederacy, Nazi Germany, and Japan chose to surrender en masse rather than go underground and continue the fight.

It frees the parties to remarry within the Catholic Church.

Given Utah, Clemson, Baylor, OSU, and LSU all go undefeated, who would you say deserves the playoff spots? Utah (11 P5 wins), Clemson (11 P5 wins), Baylor (9 P5 wins), OSU (10 P5 wins), and LSU (10 P5 wins). I would easily leave Baylor out because it doesn matter that they put up 70 on Rice and Kansas, their schedule doesn come close.

Review the basics. Rule out any of the simple solutions first. Did you recently change the type of litter your cat is used to? Did you move the litter box to a new location? Did something dramatic occur in the area where your litter box is located (this could be a loud sound, a dog scaring the cat, etc.)? Did you recently clean the litter box and use a cleanser your cat doesn't like? Does your litter box need to be cleaned? Each of these are simple fixes: Go back to your old litter; try a different location as your cat is telling you he doesn't like the new one; unless you are sure there is nothing in the area that could have scared your cat, try a new location to see if the spraying stops; do not use strong cleaners (especially ammonia based ones) as cat's do not like these strong smells (basic soap and water or bleach work best, rinse well); replace the litter..

Many times when we just wake up with a stiff neck after one night of sleeping in the wrong position it is just that our muscles have gotten stiff and we need to get some blood flow to them in order to alleviate the pain.

Unfortunately, there no point in fighting this current. Their culture is different, and sometimes, completely incompatible with others. The only way I ever seen a Korean person stop the behavior that bothers western people (that the Koreans themselves are largely unaware of) is by befriending them. After some time spent together, they often start to see other Koreans little slights against you as clearly as you do, and get annoyed by it as well.

Hey there, thanks for sharing. I know the feelings too well. On top of the world, life is sweet, nothing can go wrong and then misery, hopeless, desperation, anger, regrets. The amount you win just doesn matter for compulsive gamblers. That site could give you back your $40k in losses into your account right now but you won take the money out. You will try and win back the other $50k that never existed in the first place. And if by a miracle you do get to $100k, you might withdrawal and let say you did. Made a sick profit and you spend some winnings, buy some gifts, put some money away, etc. Then it will set in slowly but surely, the brain will crave for action. You can sleep well because it all you think about. Be it the same site again (which they are hoping) or some local casino, but as long as you give in, you continue to bet, and then before you know it, it all gone.

I think big games like the World Series are an exception, but in general poker is more interesting than baseball because there more for the (average) viewer to do watching poker.

For instance, why isn there any in game progression? In his manifesto, Garfield wrote, "Many games allow the players to level their characters or their tools. Technically I believe this could be done in a non exploitive way, if the cost to level weren't open ended (or progressively more expensive making them effectively open ended). For example, if free players had a 10% disadvantage to paying players and a player could only pay one time to level   that would be a capped and probably well distributed cost to the community.

If an opponent acts within seconds of his turn then he may be using the auto play feature. Online casinos make use of check boxes such as "fold," "raise any" or "call any." The thing you should look for here is the command "raise any," since it denotes a strong hand while "check" denotes a weak hand, and "call any" means the opponent is waiting for a miracle card..

Wall Street or Banking is the heart of a capitalist economy. It collects money through banking and financial services and redistributes it through credit. Banks let society pull money forward. The idea is to borrow money to increase productivity Then once productivity is increased you expected to pay the money back, but with increased productivity, your resource to pay back your debts is increased. 2 examples. Overall, banking lets the economy grow at a much faster rate than by increasing productivity through elbow grease alone.

They could definitely sell another one as long as they make it a $30 $40 game (with or without MP, but needs co op) and don try to push it as a AAA console seller. They should go for a more glorified Arcade game exclusive approach, kinda like how Trials Evolution was back in the day on 360..

Mobile phones have made a tremendous impact on the world, for sure. Once I saw a widow in Albania standing in her field with her cow, far from any building, talking on a mobile phone.

Now with touch phones, people in very isolated places can do banking or get news with apps.

A big part of today's e commerce landscape is the affiliate program (also known as associate programs). This area was pioneered by Amazon. Amazon allows anyone to set up a specialty book store. When people buy books from the specialty store, the person who owns the specialty bookstore gets a commission (up to 10 percent of the book's list price) from Amazon. The affiliate program gives Amazon great exposure because it now has over 1,000,000 specialty bookstores all over the Web [ref]. Therefore this model is now copied by thousands of e commerce sites. If you are setting up an e commerce site you will want to consider an affiliate program as one way to get exposure. Link Share is a company that helps e commerce sites set up affiliate programs.

Never before have we seen such nasty and insulting words being hurled at the rulers, and the public believe these accusations to be correct. Everybody knows about the past of our president and the given to him by the foreign media. Painful and annoying is the attitude of Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani. While claiming to be a descendant of Hazrat Ghaus ul Azam Abdul Qadir Gilani, he does not hesitate to tell lies with a poker face in defence of his President Asif Ali Zardari. The prime minister international standing appears to be so low that not once was he mentioned in Bob Woodward latest book Obama Wars.
