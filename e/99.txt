What you are feeling is NORMAL. It is OK! It ok to be pissed, to feel helpless, to feel despair. That is a sign that you are still alive, still human, still on the right side. But please don give up and bail on us. Some comrades in your age cohort will do just that, in a variety of ways: they kill themselves, or completely fold in on themselves in an involute and inert way, or surrender to the pull of "a normal life" and try to stave off their creeping political awareness however they can. DON DO THAT. Once you go down that road you leaving the rest of your comrades high and dry. We need you if we going to unfuck this world. Those of us in our 30s and 40s and 50s have been through what you going through and we care about you and we can help if you need help (feel free to DM me, for example).

I literally saw that the nurse who watched the door had stepped away and that the doctor wasn't watching and just sauntered behind him til outside then hopped the very normal wooden fence. Second I can't believe this moment.

My armpits are darker than the rest of my body because of my deodorant and I don't really know what to do about because I'm not sure if it's deodorant stuck to my skin or the deodorant staining my skin. Even though I do wash them every day, it's still not enough to either dislodge deodorant or remove deodorant stains. However I really don't wanna change deodorants because my armpits are super sensitive and I sweat/smell a lot so it's difficult to find deodorants that cover both needs. I'm just so frustrated :(

Most Famous Football player? The most famous football player today would be David Beckham. Though he is nearing the end of his career, it is difficult to argue with his status of best known footballer to those who aren't fans of football, in addition to those who are. However, while he'd be best known to fans of football, he would undoubtedly be less well known than Beckham to non fans.

Have you noticed that when you play in a live casino you seem uncontrollable? You keep coming back to that cash machine to withdraw cash so you can bet more. Well, at home, while it is easy to get lost in time when playing in a casino, you always have ways to stop yourself. Perhaps you could use an alarm clock that will limit your playing time or a love one who will tell you it's time to stop and sleep..

But it's really not funny.

Cashman would never cop to this, of course, but having this signing on his watch has to be an enormous invisible elephant crowding him at his desk every time he ponders another free agent deal to the end of time   and who could blame him?.

Countless stories set in the 1950 and 60 juxtapose the conservative conformity with modern reprobates like racism, homophobia, drug use, spousal abuse and PTSD; all of which certainly existed in this time frame, and without public acceptability, but it arrogant of our cohort to assume every one of these sins was under the surface of every home as we "correct" the facade with our openness to these problems. 
I can say for certain it does, but I can point to This Study on if Religion lowers Suicide Rates that concludes "They do in the US and Russia, but it increases them elsewhere."

I don know if it actually lowers rates but.

Yesterday Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize. I suggested that his speech was gag inducing and spent the rest of the day, here and elsewhere, being attacked for not seeing how incredibly subtle his "war is peace" philosophy is. I was also roundly attacked for suggesting that his claim that there is "evil in the world" and for decades it has been the US burden to fight "evil" with "just wars" sounded a hell of a lot like the Neocon rhetoric of George Dubbya and his granddaddy Ronald Reagan..

Because OMC plays so few pots, he doesn actually contribute to the jackpot/promotion pool. If the casino ran bad beat jackpots with large table percentage and ran hot seat (random draw) promotions primarily instead of high hand (which involves getting in the pot), that another advantage. Between those, the $1/hr give or take comp, and the fact that some times he chops and doesn have to lose a blind when he only has QQ, it theoretically possible.

But "friendly" poker can have the expected outcome go wrong and cause you to lose your stack, (to say nothing of ruining your credit, when borrowing to pay gambling debts) and possibly lose face/your reputation! By betting money into a pot that you know you're not likely to win, you're taking big risks (and, if you fold your bet/wagered money stays in the pot). On the other hand, sometimes opportunity strikes and looks so winnable, and the other players so "bluffable", that it seems worth such risk. Have your limits, strategy and backdoor.

It's a natural human tendency to do this, and poker players know this all too well. The truth is, you looked at a KQos from early position and then had to answer a raise from the unpredictable player two seats down.

So when James pushes $2 into the middle of the table, I am skeptical. In our circle of players, James is known as a big bluffer who will risk enormous sums for small stakes in the hopes of making a quick gain, not unlike certain Wall Street bankers.

"In the context of the Pledge, the statement that the United States is a nation "under God" is an endorsement of religion. It is a profession of a religious belief, namely, a belief in monotheism. The recitation that ours is a nation "under God" is not a mere acknowledgment that many Americans believe in a deity. Nor is it merely descriptive of the undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of the Republic. Rather, the phrase "one nation under God" in the context of the Pledge is normative. To recite the Pledge is not to describe the United States; instead, it is to swear allegiance to the values for which the flag stands: unity, indivisibility, liberty, justice, and   since 1954   monotheism. The text of the official Pledge, codified in federal law, impermissibly takes a position with respect to the purely religious question of the existence and identity of God. A profession that we are a nation "under God" is identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation "under Jesus," a nation "under Vishnu," a nation"under Zeus," or a nation "under no god," because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion."

That why it actually not very surprising that British Celtic imparted only about ten loanwords into English, but also why it very surprising that there is an absolute lack of Celtic influence on Old English syntax and sound system. This is likely because the British Celtic languages were regarded as very low prestige dialects spoken by marginal people with the lowest social status between the onset of Anglo Saxon colonisation and the Norman Conquest. The Norman Conquest is significant because the introduction of a new, Norman, ruling elite upset the previous binary between British Celtic and Anglo Saxon languages; there is indeed evidence of Celtic influence on the Middle English language which was made possible by English reduction in prestige, being replaced by Norman French.

The lower stakes don't alarm the brain quite so much, and the poker player is able to focus and make better decisions.

All of those names are uncommon enough to raise an eyebrow or two. I have other cousins whose parents gave them names that started with a hard k sound (they are actually spelled with a c in every case) to match the father name and the last name. 
I also started looking into the benefits of sex orgasms and it really helped change my mindset. Number one   women don't have to be especially "turned on" to start having an intimate experience (that's what foreplay is for). Number two  try not to view it as a chore and focus on the really nice parts (how good it feels, how close you feel to your partner after).

The Real Wheel of Fortune:Roulette is a game that does not require much skill. All you have to do to win is guess what number or color the little ball will land on. The right color pays out at 1 to 1 but the right number will pay out at 36 to 1. This means a bet of 100 dollars will get you back $3600. Players can spread bets around the table as long as all of your bets do not go over the table max. Each player is given different colored chips to make sure that players chips do not get confused. This is because it is common for several players to bet on the same number. Besides the color and number of the winner you can also bet on if the number will be an odd or an even number or which of the 3 groups of 12 numbers the winner will be in.
Training] to me represents modern day yoga, exercises adapted to our current lifestyle where we sit at computers, drive in cars and predominantly lead sedentary lives  [The] postures resemble yoga positions and when I first saw the pictures of the exercises I incorrectly assumed these were modified yoga postures and that there was nothing new, just a reinvention of an ancient tradition. Within my first 60 seconds of my [session], I realized how wrong I was. These subtle variations in positioning that form the basis of the work completely alter the dynamics of the exercises and force the body to adapt, to use muscles we leave dormant, strengthening the body in just the areas of weakness that modern life generates..

Also, playing on uneven surfaces such as a cambered road or path can put increased pressure on one side of the body.

Good friend of mine is a PA in a sketchier area of NYC. Told me a story of a woman who came in and told her she "Thinks she's got a rat in her pussy!" Excuse me ma'am what?! Well apparently whenever she and her man start going at it he feels a sharp sting on his penis so logic concludes that a rat is living inside her vagina and biting her mans penis whenever they have sex. Turns out she tore while giving birth a few months before and the surgeon left the needle attached to the stitches and it was inside her vagina.

Very cute indeed. Are there any scientific studies out there to prove frogs do infact form emotional bonds with eachother? When two snakes "cuddle" like that it's not actually because they are friends but because they tolerate eachother and both want to use the same space because it's safe there or a good basking area.

In the last 24 hours I come across two antiquarian outlooks on the longevity of the world coal supply after not having seen hardly anything of the sort written in the 19th century. (The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy". Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know.

Even if that wrong, I think the oldest lines we can trace back are those to Egypt because, well, we know people that lived in Egypt in that time XD They are going to make more DNA analysis of Egyptian kings and we will be able to proof it.

The reason is because the only way to earn money is not to play optimal game theory strategy. For example, in the above example when the opponent made a $20 dollar bet into a pot of $100 optimal theory say fold 6 out of the one time, but if you have been noticing the guy has been bluffing a lot more times than is optimal game theory, then the only way to make money is to call him more than is optimal according to game theory and try to out play your opponent or improve your hand.

Holding two pair in a home game is also hard. Often, it's beneficial to try and keep multiple players in the hand to increase the size of the pot even though it's technically bad poker.

The Economist: How do you de escalate a potential conflict when it starts to creep up and what do people think works but in fact doesn McFate: There is more to war than warfare, and more to warfare than killing. Understanding this is the key to de escalation, but many do not get it. Battlefield victory is obsolete now, yet America still invests trillions of dollars in aircraft carriers, fighter jets and killer robots and ponders why no one is deterred or defeated. The West suffers from strategic atrophy. We yearn to fight conventional wars like it's 1945, our glory days, and then wonder why we have stopped winning. War has moved on, and our enemies have moved on with it. Today, war is decided in the information space, before the first shot is fired. Diplomacy and traditional statecraft are not enough. We need information dominance and strategic subversion to prevent problems from becoming crises and crises from becoming conflicts.

Because we live in a horrible world, things like rape, murder, and rape murder can sometimes go unpunished. So the only thing that really makes us feel better is when the perpetrator is caught in the most fittingly stupid and embarrassing way possible. Take this case from Holland, where a cold case from 1999 was solved in 2012 in a manner that shouldn't have gotten past the casual suggestion phase: They just asked politely for people to submit DNA samples, hoping to randomly find the murderer."Worst case scenario, we get free blood!".

Therefore, I think it entirely possible the searchers could have contaminated DNA left by BG. I really, really hope they have something useful but the odds are bad right now. Hopefully improvements in DNA technology will solve this soon.

You can go to a local gym or community center and develop a personal exercise routine by doing push ups, sit ups, and weightlifting for you to work on by yourself. 
This video is a compilation of the thoughts of many of my friends on their outlook on life. I found that Existentialism makes a lot of view points valid and I wanted to place them all together to see how they clash and bend off of each other. I think that because so many of us have differing viewpoints maybe existence is subjective and it is what we make of it. 
I don't know specifically about the law society, but in healthcare they passed a regulation that says we must report pretty much everything. Each College is interpreting that differently. If you don't report a minor thing you're not likely to get spontaneously in trouble, but if they decide to go after you for some other reason (or someone reports you who is targeting you) they could nail you..

As our stay at this place was not likely to be very short, I thought it very necessary that some order should be observed in Traficking with the Natives, that such Merchandize as we had on board for that purpose might continue to bear a proper value, and not leave it to everyone's own particular fancy, which could not fail to bring on Confusion and Quarrels between us and the Natives, and would infallibly lessen the value of such Articles as we had to trafick with. In Order to prevent this, the following rules were ordered to be Observed; viz.:. 
I wait years between albums for western artists all the time but the quality advances each time (mostly). 
I on immunosuppressants as well. I prefer it if people are any type of contagious sick that they stayed home vs going to the gym not only for people like us, but for the general population too. It rude to knowingly spread contagious illnesses. In a perfect world, cleaning down the equipment would be enough but I don think it is. Every time you cough, breath, etc you potentially spreading those germs. I think I gotten more grumpy about this type of stuff since starting immunosuppressants because you right, that cold doesn just take me out for a week and steroids are such a horrible/amazing drug. I have colitis, celiac, and likely endometriosis (have yet to have confirmation through laparoscopy) and pressure on my abdominals from the fabric does not feel nice. I started working out at home wearing almost no clothing, so I find that too tight too much fabric really does disrupt my form and comfort. The least important thing is that I also feel less attractive wearing these leggings, I don find they are flattering on me. I like my abs, and I don mind that my body bloats/swells. I don need to "suck in or flatten" my natural curve.
Now, the fuck you I do what I want and you beneath me types can all go fuck themselves. I want that distinction to be clear.

Some majors are harder than others. Some would advise you to take an easy major and get a 4.0 just to help you get that first job. But you have to understand that working with computers is not a highly desired job in most companies  it is work that most people would dread, so that 4.0 is less important as the economy improves and is unimportant after you get that first 2 years or work experience. On the other hand, you could go with the hardest major you can understand (mathematics, various engineering), perhaps not get as high a grade, but conclusively prove that you a massive brain. Employers see those majors and just want to hire you for your brain, you be working with computers all right. Having such a major on your resume is good for your entire life, it will open up all kinds of doors. You can eliminate programs that are too hard by looking up the name of the textbook used for the mandatory intro class and getting a look at it in the library or bookstore.

But is it any easier to affect actual change? The thing that frustrates me the most about whenever the internet has some freak out about some social issue popping up in media is who or what is this even helping? Setting aside the fact that there are all sorts of more pressing issues we could be getting angry about, even if we just narrow our scope to only caring about these issues, what is achieved from all of this internet fighting? I doubt we changing any positions on this. The people who already agree get to pat themselves on the back for not being an other and we all get the chance to kick an easy target. The people we against harden themselves in their position and have their ideas that the left is only interested in trivial issues and hating on them reinforced, which makes it harder for us when we want to push for other, more serious issues. Gender discrimination in the workplace is an issue, proper access to birth control and other healthcare is an issue, fair and adequate parental leave is an issue, etc, some trolls on the internet not liking a movie made by billionaires because it stars a woman who a millionaire is. way down the list of things we should be angry about. It not not an issue, it just not one that has returns which justify all of the political capital we waste on it.

The part that kills me is in these threads there is often times someone who says "it the least she could do" or "it a small act to show her consideration."

Here's the thing: The reason Bond's dramatic reveal is so, well, dramatic is that it's completely unexpected that a pair of low cards would actually win the game. It's statistically ludicrous that Bond won with what he had. And while it seems "smart" that he would surprise everyone like that, for anyone who knows how to play poker, the real reason it's shocking is because no idiot would hold on to those cards in the first place.

Are there any studies about tolerance buildup with long term Pramipexole treatment of RLS? I on it for 8 years now and have to increase my dosage by a bit every 4 6 months. While my dosage is stil fine (about 0.35mg) I quite bothered by the possibility of being at max dosage at some point and running out of treatment options. If I extrapolate my increases in dosage I might by at about 1mg before I 70, at which point the side effects might be intolerable from what I read.

Analysts and executives say there are several solid reasons to make and promote such cars now. They can help lower average fleet emissions to meet government requirements in Europe, offsetting increasing sales of conventionally powered sport utility vehicles.

It was a drop of about 2.6 per cent.But the price has recovered during the early afternoon, and is none back at $69.82, MarketWatch reports.It came after United CEO Oscar Munoz released a statement Monday night that doubled down on his airline crew's decision to remove an elderly passenger, claiming he was'disruptive and belligerent'.The airline is facing a furious backlash after footage emerged of the 69 year old, bleeding heavily as he was pulled from the jet.Amidst the anger, Munoz issued a public apology saying he 'apologized for having to re accommodate these customers.'But in a private email to employees, the CEO defended the crew's actions, calling the passenger'disruptive and belligerent' and praising his staff for going 'above and beyond'.Social media erupted immediately, labeling Munoz and United 'tone deaf' and 'condescending'.Munoz said that while he was 'upset' to hear about the man being violently dragged off the flight, that airline crew had simply been following 'established procedures.'The CEO described how flight crews had offered up to $1,000 in compensation for anyone willing to catch the next flight before approaching the passenger to 'explain apologetically' that he was being denied boarding.He had then 'raised his voice and refused to comply' with the crew's requests to leave the aircraft, and became increasingly 'disruptive and belligerent,' he said.'Our agents were left with no choice, but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight, he repeatedly decline to leave.'Munoz added that the passenger refused to comply with the officers who then 'physically removed him from the flight as he continued to resist   running back onto the aircraft in defiance of both out crew and security officials.'The comments have sparked outrage online with people claiming that the CEO was attempting to shift blame to the police'While I deeply regret this situation arose, I also emphatically stand behind all of you, and I want to commend you for continuing to go above and beyond to ensure we fly right,' he said.The CEO did, however, concede that there were 'lessons we can learn' from the experience and that United will continue to look into the incident.He also had a final reminder that treating customers with 'respect and dignity' should be matter of course, 'no matter how challenging the situation.'.

As the stock market was pressing higher and higher in the summer of 1987, Martin Zweig had a feeling enough was enough.
