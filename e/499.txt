But honestly, reading people's race reports here and how often people took pride in their achievements of any level, the encouragement they got from friendly folks here, and how they pushed through definitely helped me. I decided I didn't want to let myself down and have all my work to this point be for nothing..

I been reading a book called Canon Revisited by Michael Kruger. In it, he reviews various canonical critical methods, and articulates what I found to be a compelling point. He argues that a believer cannot disengage his faith/theology from canonical evaluation, unless he supposes that the canon writing, reception and acceptance as canon were wholly human endeavors, separate from God divine intervention, as one would evaluate any other ancient text. But, I can because the Church does believe God divinely inspired and directed what ultimately became canon, so why must we subject our text criticism to a secular/non theological evaluation method?

 7 points  submitted 1 day agoYou right, but if that is the case then the fact that such a person remains in a Church that ordains people they think are illegitimate is in itself incoherent. If you are a communicant that means that you are confessing that you believe in the doctrines of the body you belong to. If, for example, I somehow came around to changing my mind on the ordination of women, I simply could not continue communing in the Church of Canada, let alone remain in the Anglican Communion at all, because the issue goes to the foundations of doctrine and principles and the very legitimacy of the Communion, not simply about whether or not, by accident or design, I happened to only be at services with male clergy.The whole thing is ecclesiastical nonsense.

I'm honestly in the same boat. A few months ago I realized that in my life a huge part of what will give me purpose is being a good mother, and I'm still a couple years away from feeling comfortable to start that journey, AND I'm not married yet, nor do I feel confident in getting engaged any time soon. However, before I try and even bring up marriage with the person I'm seeing I have to bring up what I've realized to him, and see if he sees that as something that will happen.

Let also look at the main series games for leveling a Pokemon. When you need to level up, what do you do? You take your Pokemon out and battle with it somewhere. If you got a brain you try to figure out the place to go that awards the most exp for the level of Pokemon you got. After a few battles, your Pokemon levels up. It greatly dependant on what Pokemon it is, what level it is, what Pokemon you fighting etc, but I would guess that it takes under a 15 minutes to get one level on one Pokemon. How much time does it take to do like 10 PvAI trainer battles? Roughly 15 minutes? Seems commensurate.

Clinical audit has long been a feature of clinical training for junior doctors, so I expected time to be set aside in which we could do it. However, the reality was hours of work, usually conducted outside working hours, rifling through archived notes in a solitary and unfulfilling manner which normally stopped when the data collection was complete. My findings were rarely implemented or re evaluated by the same junior doctor and the opportunity to witness any improvement in patient care was even rarer. I had always engaged in clinical audit, even winning an award for the best audit in my F1 year, but I was left uninspired and struggled to see the relevance of my efforts.

The poles are relatively easy to establish: the literal camp would have believed in the gods. These stories make claims to be inspired by the muses, who witnessed the events and ostensibly use the bards as mouthpieces. The word "mmemnonai" is a storytelling word which means "I remember" but really "I remember exactly."

Long streaks of survivor play. I only play bill, out of honor for Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Bill gets killed almost immediately in every game. He opens the god damned gate even if there a heartbeat. He goes back to the hook when the gate is open. He diverts a chase and uses self rez to keep things moving. Pops gennies to distract for rescues and genny caps. He misses his M16.

Certainly, most polls have chosen him as the greatest ever tennis player, but even as a 'grass player' only, I would choose him as the Best. The reason I say this is that 9 of his 11 Grand slam singles titles were won on grass. Yet a further 4 Professional Slam singles titles were also won on grass, whereas, if one was to compare with Tilden [as suggested above]   Tilden won only 2 on grass.

That's my useless take, anyway.I like him a lot. I think he has good ideas and is extremely intelligent. I just can't see him becoming president. 5 10 years ago he would have been my absolute ideal candidate, purely because of my positions on social, scientific, and technological issues. All of which are vital and often overlooked in presidential platforms.But the older I get the more I realize just how important foreign policy is, especially when dealing with nations that want nothing more than to see the US fall into oblivion.

But then all that pretty plastic money disappeared last fall. Medical credit companies shut down or clamped down on who got credit. Credit cards lowered their limits and upped their standards for who could have one. So many of the not terribly rich turned to the black market for certain cosmetic procedures, like silicon injections. There are no definite numbers on it, but a recent death in the Bronx reminds us that when people believe they need something  whether it heroin or a plumper, more jaunty ass  they will do what they have to to get it.

Both of the weapons used by Lubke aircraft seem as though they would be devastating, and indiscriminate. (Politicians would pull away from the idea of attacking civilian areas and sign treaties to that effect that all went away with the invasion of China by Japan, and the attack upon cities by Nazi forces in WWII the Allies followed suit almost immediately thereafter.) Lubke image (which appears in the section titled "Der Zukunftskrieg und die Technik") must have seemed terrifying to his readers of 1927, though they are at least spared the image of the effects on the population in the imagery of the attack. 
Do people honestly think the first guy to build a fossil fueled factory did it to pass along the savings to consumers? LOL, no. He did it because burning fossil fuels to do work that was previously done by hand allowed him to fire half of his workers and keep more of the profit for himself. Then he realized that he could make even more profit if he first lowered his prices long enough to put all his competitors who didn use fossil fuels out business and then jacked up the prices once he was the only game in town.

What is happening is the propagation of bad ideas in the absence of criticism. Religions do the exact same shit. So do anti vaxxers, and moon landing conspiracists, and homeopathic doctors. It is not new, and it is not limited to hate speech. Neither is hate speech a requirement for the spread of idiotic ideas. Hate speech is just a large part of the white supremacist shtick. No matter how you attempt to ban it you will not stop them from spreading their ideas. You will just keep those out of public discussion and away from criticism.

All of this porn has created a variety of "sex wars" over the dangers of porn. Some porn scholars and political activists have claimed that porn is in and of itself a form of sex discrimination since it doesn just represent men committing acts of violent sex against women, it encourages them to do so. Legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon once went so far as to suggest porn doesn just cause individual rape, but the systemic sort of rape committed by nation states like that committed by the Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. Other porn scholars have pooh poohed the idea that porn has real world effects or at least no more than any other form of representation, like advertising.

A wall that partially uses natural features with the intent to completely seal off the border without (in their estimation) passable gaps is certainly coast to coast, bar irrelevant pedantry, and absolutely what he promised. His "big, beautiful wall" has shrunk from just over 1,000 miles, to just over 500. Given that there already about 700 miles of fencing, with massive gaps in barriers, and that fencing would largely need to be replaced in order to meet his various promises, how is 500 miles going to achieve his goal? Even if it did seal overland passage, smugglers already use legal ports of entry or underground tunnels, depending on what they smuggling.

If having access to a gambling casino is important to you, plan carefully in advance to ensure that your island destination has all the features and amenities you're looking for. Visitors who plan to spend a good part of their vacation in the casino would be well advised to book themselves into a hotel or resort that either has an on site casino or is located close to one.

We find that the dynamics are noisy, but basically oscillatory for short enough estimation periods and slow enough frequency adjustments, but that the dynamics can be very different for other parameter values..

Be mindful of post traumatic stress (PTS) as the majority of tactile athletes have some form of PTS. PTS manifests in several ways and ranges from unnoticeable to serious.

PTS may worsen with age, showing up in veterans later in life as their fellow service members pass away. veterans who had PTS and head injury experienced higher self reported pain compared to PTS without head injury (Stojanovic et al., 2016) so be mindful that these individuals may have lower pain thresholds.

Bell the cat To dare to confront danger at its source, despite overwhelming odds. The allusion is to a fable recounted in Langland Piers Plowman (1377). A group of mice continually harassed by a certain cat met to decide what to do about the problem.

The idea of confronting an opposing force suggests that the expression may derive from a sport such as wrestling. This theory is highly conjectural, however, because the many meanings and uses of grip allow for a variety of possible explanations.
