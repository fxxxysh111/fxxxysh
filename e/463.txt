There is an expectation of submission that even Victoria feels compelled to comply with: she asks his permission in two different episodes to remove Feodora from the household, apparently forgetting that she's the monarch, not him. And how can she act as ruler of her country when her own husband undermines and belittles her at every turn?

My emphasis is on electromagnetics, and the work that I did on the boards was late stage, basically signing off.

Bochy decided to play the percentages because a big hit would tie the score (Aurilia ended up hitting a hard grounder to third for a forceout at home). I realize Ishikawa and Sandoval are platooning at first base right now, so Ishikawa won have many opportunities against left handers. But, at some point, don the Giants want to see how Ishikawa would fare in a pressure situation and against a lefty? Like in the 4th inning of a game that inconsequential to teams in the playoff hunt? For the record, Ishikawa hit .245 in 45 at bats against lefties in Fresno. With the Giants, he had 30 at bats. He had one plate appearance against a lefty and drew a walk. So is it too soon to pencil him in for Opening Day 2010? Besides the Giants signing its top draft picks, there was a lot of Giants news this past week, so let quickly recap.

It is difficult not to mourn the end of a relatively open border. Yesterday, as my daughters and I drove up to Montreal for our usual dim sum, I could not find their passports.

He seemed friendly and unconcerned about the sesame balls in the back seat. As of today, that friendliness will be more difficult to enact. We can no longer pretend that Vermont is a part of Quebec or that Canada is the 51st state of the United States.

There's nothing wrong with that," Gillespie said, adding that Dougherty has accountants "and very good lawyers who make sure he doesn't come anywhere near the margins of impropriety."Union dues can't go for direct political contributions, but union funds can go to political action committees (PACs), which support campaigns.So the more than $1.5 million in 2015 support to Dougherty's brother Kevin's successful campaign to become a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge came from the union's PAC.Starting in 2014, the union's PAC gave Tom Wolf for Governor $160,000 in direct contributions and another $44,000 in campaign support, including catering and office supplies.Building a Better Pennsylvania Fund was another big beneficiary of Local 98's largesse.

That kid would have to miss all of school their entire life, to be an adult and never potty trained. This bitch is just stupid and in to a weird fetish.

So if you hold the nut flush on the river, even though your equity is 100%, your EV is much more than 100% if you have more money left in your stacks because you will win whatever else your opponent puts in the pot. And if you have a very weak hand, even though your equity might be 5%, your EV might be lower than that or even 0% as whenever your opponent bets, you have to fold, and if your opponent doesn bet and lets you show down, you had the worst hand anyway.

I am 65 yrs old, old enough to remember what really went on during the Vietnam war. It was common knowledge that if you had enough money and the right connections, you could escape the draft. My friends, neighbors and relatives had a choice, either serve as cannon fodder in an unpopular war or escape to Canada. Most served.

This rightly made people furious, it was one of the main reasons that war veterans publicly protested against the war. My hope and prayer is that we never, ever again have a draft, as nothing has changed, if anything there is an ever sharper divide between the rich and poor, and history will just repeat itself.

Although it is possible your fingerboard is warping, there should be a curve to your board, just about how you described it. A board with no curve to it is more likely to buzz. If you want to post a pic with the straightedge against the board so I can see the dip, it will help confirm, but it more likely that the temperature and humidity changes between summer and winter have brought the neck angle up, and that why the bridge seems low. If it a regular problem, you might look into getting a summer bridge and a winter bridge and switching them out as need be.

Although, I am a giant fucking nerd with that kind of stuff (I still have the matrix code coming down as my screen saver, but I'm a developer and work with like minded people), but it's really well done and the fight choreography is great for two guys who had probably never done martial arts prior. If you're interested, go back and get through The Matrix if you haven't already. Second was ok, third was so bad I left the theater borderline depressed..

This was likely a Procon script that kicked you. High pop servers will set the ping limit pretty low in order to preserve the gameplay experience for players closer to the physical server location. Ping limits can be higher or even nonexistent on lower pop servers, so you may want to try your luck there. Just don be surprised if people start griping at you because they get bad hit reg on you or you are killing them behind walls. Better to kick the high pingers than to run off a large portion of a server regular player base (especially community regulars that are likely helping to pay the servers rental fees).

Hi. I am a native English speaker living in a non native English speaking country. I have many friends and students from many countries and their is kind of an unspoken etiquette about this. Generally you speak in your conversation in the language that you think the most people will understand. If you have trouble, you switch for a phrase and then try to explain it or ask for help explaining it. Sometimes big groups fracture, and in that instance it ok to speak in the most common language there, but if someone joins, you may want to switch back when you would normally say "we were just talking about X." What you should not do under any circumstance is proceed to speak in a language that someone does not understand (unless you share no languages) because that is just telling them that they are not welcome in the conversation. I suggest the next time she does this right in front of you, you just ask your boyfriend what she said (don be embarrassed to not know a language, it like being embarrassed you can suddenly pick up a guitar and play free bird) and then respond to it like she was talking to you too. If she continues, tell her that you feel left out (dint be embarrassed to have emotions that are appropriate in the situation) and you would like to be in the conversation too.

I don't know (or remember if Kyle said) when this all happened   just that it was before RHOBH. If Kim was actively an alcoholic, I could see the argument that she wasn't in the right frame of mind to make such a decision. But I also think she might have just regretted it and since she is incapable of admitting she made a mistake or did something wrong, can't just admit to herself that she shouldn't have sold her share, but did, and regretted it. 
I always wondered how she would feel if she found out after all those years of being lied to (because yes, lying by omission is still lying)..

On one occasion, in order to see what he would do, I purposely laughed immoderately every time he failed. It so happened that lie did so several times in succession partly, I believe, in consequence of my laughing and eventually he became so distressed that he positively pretended catch the fly, going through all the appropriate actions with his lips and tongue, and afterwards rubbing the ground with his neck as if to kill the victim : he then looked up at me with a triumphant air of success.

The mystery has been drawing a moderate amount of attention ever since. Along with Hance and other interested parties, Reddit has been tinkering with the mystery, but to this day there is no conclusive breakthrough. Some say (and Occam's razor strongly suggests) that a local eccentric lawyer, who has allegedly been placing the ads for at least a decade but claims to work for others, is the person behind the "secret society." Others speculate that either Hance is in on the con or this is a wacky long con that members of the university have been keeping up for decades to mess with people, and a bunch of students and professors are having a ball at Hance's expense.

I think this article does a good job of pointing out issues with the metric that is being used to make the claim that poverty is decreasing.

The entire time I'm walking through the house it feels like there's someone standing behind me, looking for me to slip up just once.

When it comes time to leave, remember that the dealer does not have access to cash at the tables. To change your chips for cash, you must go to the casino cashier's booth. If you have a lot of smaller denomination chips and wish to change for larger denomination chips to make it easier to carry them to the cashier's booth, ask the dealer to "color up." He or she then will give you one green $25 chip for five red $5 chips, or a black $100 chip for twenty $5 chips, for example.

Several visits a day is not acceptable. One hour notice is not acceptable either. And just knocking at the door as a complete stranger is appalling.

Any tournament game where a Terran loses to a similar level Zerg / Protoss: / PROTOSSED SO BROKEN / UNFAIR / IMBALANCED tournament game where a Terran wins against a similar level Zerg / Protoss: SO GOOD doesn do well for a single tournament: TERRAN / XYZ know all players are biased to some extent but the levels of Terran whining are just fucking incomprehensible.

If I had been shocked into reality with a faceful of water, perhaps I would have predicted the success with which white resentment would be mobilized in groups like the Tea Party. Righteous anger of the white masses is not at the bankers and politicians who put us in this mess, but at Mexican immigrants. If I could have predicted that a huge portion of angry white Americans would have their rage misdirected, perhaps I could have also known that the Obama administration would not be able to resist the lure of military "solutions" to political and economic problems.

The inflammation is likely a result of eating a high carbohydrate diet. When you go low carb, eating more fat (including more cholesterol), the inflammation in your body goes down. Your body then doesn need so much cholesterol coursing through your veins to repair the damage from the inflammation. So although you are eating more cholesterol, your body is just processing it for energy and only making the necessary levels for typical body repair/processes rather than damage control from inflammation. That why people who go low carb typically notice lower cholesterol levels than they previously had (although not always). In addition, low carbers are making more of the fluffy LDL rather than the dense LDL.

The criticism about Schneiderlin passing and transition to attack are fair but I think not too worrisome.

And the whole thing could save your life when they find cancer growing silently in your intestines.

When switching from clarinet to saxophone (any saxophone   soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, etc), this set embouchure makes a difference. Saxophone embouchures are much more loose and changeable. It is impossible to get low notes out immediately coming from a clarinet background, because the embouchure is too tight. High notes usually go very sharp. In fact, most of the notes are sharp right off the bat. It takes time and practice to relearn an embouchure.

The LDP, in past years faulted for building to nowhere, has long relied on robust fiscal policy stimulus spending to spur demand through public works construction. But if larding the economy with pork barrel spending alone was going to work, Japan economy would have bounced back long ago, some analysts note. Monetary easing has likewise failed in the past: Interest rates have remained near zero for years, but have not enticed the kind of investment boom needed to spur growth. Consequently, Abe pushed the Bank of Japan (BOJ), despite its ostensible autonomy, to commit to achieving a 2% inflation target within two years. Supporters of this approach further contend that former BOJ governor Masaaki Shirakawa, who stepped down in late March, had failed to ease monetary policy quickly or boldly enough to break out of deflation and that his predecessors withdrew easing efforts too soon before the economy was sufficiently jump started.
