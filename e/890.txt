"This was a completely different, very unpredictable, and aggressive Kim sitting next to me in the car, and to be honest, it made me feel extremely nervous and anxious.

One day my character was in the ring berating a 7 foot 5, 500 pound WWE superstar known as The Big Show. In the ring, that's what I do no matter the wrestler and the audience eats it up. But not even 24 hours later, I was encouragingly pumping up a room full of Special Olympics athletes. And later that same week, I gave a measured brand presentation to an audience of 300. While not every leader goes toe to toe with The Big Show, the lesson is the same: Every audience is different. Whether you're presenting in a boardroom, having a strategic discussion with your team or marketing to your consumers, you need to engage each audience in a different manner for the best results. (Though no matter the audience, you should be entertaining and use storytelling as a means to make your goals and messages relatable to your target.) From a consumer standpoint, data and analytics can only enhance your ability to know what your customers want. If you know your audience, you can move them to action by finding out what motivates them and adjusting your message accordingly.

I gotta disagree. When you begin playing with players better than you, you should lose, but that is the price for learning to play better. I played 1/2 far too long, cause I thought I couldn hang with 2/5 guys. Last year I started playing with 2/5 guys and after a while, it turns out they are not that good. I did lose much more than I won for a couple of months, but I learned from it. I mean they are better than the average 1/2 player, but there is nobody that "scares" me. I have gotten so much better.

The fervor and ideological fury with which many people attempt to dismiss the modernization benefits is a prime example of revisionism people feel justified ignoring facts about one area of history because of ongoing anger over the atrocities committed by the imperial regime. That post colonial ideology, not history. These included rapid urban growth, the expansion of commerce, and forms of mass culture such as radio and cinema, which became widespread for the first time.

Thus a new to the category brand effectively communicates to consumers by being both differentiated from the category and relevant at the same time.

How to be a better poker player maybe? Isn that a good goal?

Due to extreme sucking when the mouth kisses and sucks on the skin, the underlying capillaries and blood vessels on the skin can burst and bleed.

Since some nerve endings may also be damaged or irritated in the bruised area, the kiss mark can feel sore or slightly painful when touched or rubbed.

Four of a kind is one of the easiest ones to spot. Look at your cards, and if you have 4 of any number or letter (four As or four 6s for instance), then you have four of a kind. so check the rules of whatever kind you are playing to know how many of the cards in your hand need to be combined with how many on the table, but the four of a specific number or letter will be the same.

The inaugural event in 1970 was contested by six of the most prominent names in the game and the winner decided by ballot. Moss received the backing of his peers and became the first ever poker world champion. In 1971, when the WSOP reverted to a winner takes all tournament format, he won again. In all, Moss won a total of nine first place bracelets and was the most successful WSOP player of the 1970s.

For my sister wedding, we were lined up by height (and at 6 I was first bridesmaid behind maid of honor). I really didn care, and would have been happier just being a wedding guest, which is what lead me and my DH to have no wedding party at all for our wedding. Another friend was at first sad, but once I stressed how important she was to me (and she heard horror stories about bridesmaids in other weddings) she came around quickly.

So. I was maybe 5 or so. My sister is 2 years older than me so 7ish. My parents were on vacation for the week and left us with my aunt. It was during the winter and not Christmas vacation yet so we still had to go to school, but the deal was as soon as we got home from school we would go tobogganing (Canada!) down the hill behind our house. Well. My sister came down with some sickness I can remember which and ended up staying home from school. I still had to go. So the school bell rings and I catch the bus and little five year old me is just vibrating from excitement for today after school activity. I get off the bus and run home and burst through the door. Just in time to see my red faced aunt and sister taking off their wet snow suits after an afternoon of tobogganing without me. I still am and will probably forever be bitter about that bullshit.

"The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the jammed condition of the airplane's right elevator, which resulted from exposure to localized, dynamic wind while the airplane was parked and rendered the airplane unable to rotate during takeoff," they wrote in their report. "Contributing to the accident were (1) the effect of a large structure on the gusting surface wind at the airplane's parked location, which led to turbulent gust loads on the right elevator sufficient to jam it, even though the horizontal surface wind speed was below the certification design limit and maintenance inspection criteria for the airplane, and (2) the lack of a means to enable the flight crew to detect a jammed elevator during preflight checks for the Boeing MD 83 airplane.

Dodds makes the case here that "respect for knowledge" is precisely what leads to Oedipus destruction, and I suspect it a reading that Nietzsche would have appreciated. Bear in mind that the Dionysian in The Birth of Tragedy is more than just strong emotion: it is also the death wish of all appearance, the yearning for the annihilation of the individual in being reunited with the primal unity underlying all of existence. In "tearing away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived", Oedipus enacts this rejection of mere appearances and experiences, as Nietzsche sees it, the Dionysian in the moment, not of his anger and impulsiveness, but of his downfall precisely as a result of his loyalty to the truth..

Together we fought, working out way through many adventures, until we had toppled the Tyrant King himself, and set the whole Empire free. Or at least so we had thought. With the leader of the country usurped, the world was left in a state of Chaos, one in which the Guild stepped up to the plate. My friends, recognized for their good work, were instated, along with Atlas, as one of the major players in the Guild, becoming world leaders, practically overnight. With my goal behind me, and that rage, slowly fading away, day by day, I slipped away, finding myself a nice quiet place, away from everyone and everything else. I still kept up to date with the news, of course, but my name wasn't remembered the way that theirs had been. I had the luxury of a nice quiet life, and I had given up my dream, for a second chance. All of my friends, had seemingly forgotten about me, just like all the rest, and a part of me was fine with that. They all had lives to live, and with so much life in them, it was only natural that people would gravitate to them. I was never really quite that way. I stayed to myself, and fought out of necessity, not enjoyment.

There is a difference in Icelandic law between a middle name and a second given name. Middle names are the same for both genders and are really uncommon. Second given names are just that: second given names which means the person has two given names, both appropriate for their gender.

Oh dear! I think you may have read my first comment wrong, I do not have double standards, I never outright said it was a horrible racist thing I just meant it was rude and kind of mean towards the race OP was, this is because in her example she gave, the comment was not "I not usually attracted to people of your race" and instead "you are attractive for a member of your race" which implies they believe that OP race is ugly or bad, rather then that they just have a preference (which is fine, you don need to be attracted to everyone) and when you imagine it in a scenario, saying something like (and I just using this ethnicity as an example) "your hot! for an asian." rather than "I not usually attracted to asians but I think you hot" is a bit rude. Also can I just say that you don have to be rude to me, call me a hypocrite and say things like "oh I assume that you think [obviously stupid thing that nobody thinks]" because I really just trying to have a debate here and now you just being mean.

The positive effects of physical activity extend to fine cell morphology. In particular, exercise affects the properties of dendritic spines, which are actin rich protusions on the dendrites that contain excitatory synapses. Changes in spine size and quantity are associated with LTP induction and are considered to support changes in synaptic strength. In a recent study it was shown that running enhanced spine density in the dentate gyrus, area CA1 and entorhinal cortex layer III [72], extending previous work [73]. Physical activity also accelerates the maturation of dendritic spines in newborn neurons [74].

I sincerely believe you making mountains out of molehills here. This is not akin to a racial slur, even in the slightest and comparing it to one is completely asinine, and I think that anyone who been called a racial slur at any point in their lives would agree. To make a big deal about it is to completely misunderstand its use based on the fact that the dictionary says that it usually used derogatorily, and I wager that the fact that it is mentioned to be derogatory is that Luther is arguing against their positions every single time he uses it.If it were, indeed, an offensive term, I be in support of never using it, but the fact of the matter is that no one sees it in the same offensive manner as you seem to.

Furthermore, and humorously, you don even realize that I used your own flawed logic against you; when you insisted in an earlier reply that "it doesn make sense" for a "lawful character" or a "thief who doesn get caught" to be in prison, I couldn believe you were unable to think of why. Even I can think of easy justifications: Innocent law abiding people are thrown in jail all the time just because they likely suspects, or because the law officers are corrupt. The thief who "doesn get caught" logically must been caught before, so he/she must have the experience required to know how not to get caught.

Understand card counting. You're not literally counting the value of all the cards. What some players do (when they're really good) is count the "value" of the deck, or, more specifically, how many aces and tens are left to be played (or this and that.) If lots are still to be seen, they up their bets, knowing the likelihood of them getting a good hand is better..

The 16th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is used as a symbol for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, which is 3.141592653, commonly rounded to 3.14. Perhaps no other number has been more pondered, examined and calculated than pi. The writings described how to create a square area the same size as a circle. The Exact Value of Pi Over the years, pi, which was named some 3,000 years later, has been calculated numerous times to the maximum decimal place that humans and calculating devices could take it. In 1596, it was calculated to 32 decimal places and up to 127 places by 1719. In 1949, the ENIAC took 70 hours to yield 2,037 digits. However, in 1997, a Hitachi mainframe computed pi to 51.5 billion digits in 29 hours. The bottom line is that the absolutely exact value of pi cannot be computed. (Full Answer)

It isn bull shit and just look at the statistics. 50% divorce rate and the majority of that percentage is initiated by the wife. Now look at the overwhelming statistics of who financially benefits the most from that divorce. Now look and see who gets majority custody of the children. I not saying this is the fault of women I saying I against marriage and our divorce culture because it overwhelmingly supports one sex over the other for no reason(which can be argued is rooted in our history of a patriarchal society). It is not equality in any shape or form. But please continue to call me a misogynist for pointing out facts because you too lazy go come up with an actual argument. It much easier to put words in my mouth and call me names then debate a very simple point. I mean just look at the rate of suicide in men after a divorce and tell me that in no way is related to financial ruin and the loss of children which our current divorce courts decide unfairly.

If ads were different colors on different subs, that might confuse normal users. And making an entire color off limits is pretty restrictive, if you blocked only the exact color then you could still use a shade similar to it, and if you block all similar shades then mods could no longer use an entire category of colors. If promoted posts were a mute shade, like a light gray ish blue, I think that could probably work without restricting mod color options.

Making it worse is there are constantly on break and off shift dealers sitting games and they will tip dealers $12 in a $25 $30 pot. Money is siphoned off the table like I have never seen. I do not get in hands with dealers because of this, but it still sucks to see other players stacks get worked.

This would make marketing Smash as a prime opportunity for advertisers so much easier since they can be guaranteed over a period of time over many demographics and locations rather than trying to get sponsors for every individual tournament. It would also take a lot of pressure off the smaller tournaments to look for sponsors.

In poker, as in business, you must learn to adapt to the situation. The constitution of the players at your table, the small blinds and the big blinds, the stakes, and the intensity of the game will determine what approach you should adopt.

Ivey is one of the few poker players to succeed in the largest cash games in both live and online play, whilst notching victories in the world's biggest tournaments seemingly at will. His expertise pervades through all formats of poker   a rare talent! Between 2004 and 2006, he was a member of the infamous 'Corporation' which relieved billionaire banker, Andy Beal, of millions of dollars in the biggest game in history. Beal, a gifted mathematician and card player, had come to Vegas and challenged the local big name professionals to a heads up Texas Holdem contest with betting units ranging between $25k, $50k, $100k and $200k.

The options for more affordable education are there, they just don't know enough so a lot of kids are taking out massive loans, going to shitty schools that market themselves as good choices to naive students, choosing bad majors because recruiters and advisors promise that there's jobs, or going to overpriced private schools. Schools are pushing them to college but are often times not elaborating on that aside from "follow your passions", which often times results in people living in poverty until they give up on their passions. Schools need a mandatory detailed thorough class where they exclusively prepare the students on succeeding past high school whether it be college or something else.. 
"Some are really shy and see it and run away and smile. Others see it and come running up," he says. "It made me realize it's really a lot deeper than just that initial hug.

The larger factors were Brady having fewer targets, Brady trying to force it down the field when he has little to no downfield accuracy anymore/little to no good downfield targets, the lack of a good offensive line presence to start any good running plays, and a defense that truly blew giving up huge run plays, long range pass plays, and (IIRC) the Pats went negative in the turnover margin (too lazy to confirm).. 
I would generally disagree with this. Unless you have a really strong hand (this means a hand that has EV greater than 1.5bb) you want a fold. For example, in a 6max game, if we open UTG, pokersnowie says that only AKs, QQ+ have EV > 1.5bb.
