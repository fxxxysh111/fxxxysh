If atomic decay were happening at 1000x the speed it happens today, it also going to be producing 1000x the heat.And that amount of heat would cook the Earth.Cepitore  4 points  submitted 9 days agoHow much extra heat would be produced if the decay rate was going at an increased rate for roughly 6 months? Also consider that the objective of the flood was to destroy the planet, so there would be a certain level of catastrophic heat that would still fit the narrative.This is all hypothetical, so if we are assuming there is something wrong with radiometric dating data, we couldn't even be sure that pressure was the sole cause of inflated dating calculations so we can't just chalk it all up as 100% due to increased decay rate.My point is, under these hypothetical assumptions, we don't know how much of the misinterpreted data is due to inconsistent decay, and therefore it's tough to guess how much heat the process produced.The main question is still, can pressure possibly alter decay rate? If yes, how much does it take, and if no, why?We just had a treatment on /r/debateevolution that attempted to put a number on this: they took the current heat gradient due to isotopic decay heat, and rolled it backwards to produce the numbers for a 6000 year old Earth assuming we got the decay rates wrong.This isn quite the scenario you asked about, but it fairly similar: instead of a one off event, it a constant rate change, so your scenario would produce a far higher peak temperature; it would still release the same amount of energy over time, so your 6 month scenario would be several thousand times hotter than this.Anyway, 1km underground would be 10x as hot as the sun, which I suggest is probably wrong. According to these numbers, the Earth would still be hot today, as there no other way to get rid of the heat other than radiating it into space.So, I don think this suggestion works.Dzugavili  5 points  submitted 2 days agoEvery such test is embarrassing because all the molecular clock tests of living fossils so far have shown the MRCA is youthful, not hundreds of millions of years old.Because 2 to the 50th power is one quadrillion, the MRCA for any individual species is youthful by mathematics: there only so many generations before the naive ancestor count exceeds the population, and so we are going to start seeing some convergence.

Well, the Sims 3 isn't out yet. It is set to be released on June 2nd (in America). I would imagine that the Sims 3 will be better than the Sims 2. The graphics are better, and the gameplay is easier. Also, sims now have five personality traits. The traits they have carry through into gameplay. Example: a sensitive sim would probably take everything personal (I'm guessing this would mean the sim would have a negative sign a lot when talking to someone) and a lazy sim will not like to clean up their messes. Overall, I'm guessing that the Sims 3 will be a lot better and have much more to offer. (edit) Before the flop the pair of threes win because a pair is better than a high card. Its pretty much luck and either hand is fine. In the long run you would want threes every time, and you,d make .02% profit, but that amount of hands isn't possible and the profit is negligible. This of course doesn't include fold equity, along with many other factors. To put it into simple terms, If you have AQ and you know your opponent has 33. if the question was AQ or 99 or something the math is pretty similar but it changes the second part of my analysis a little. So in the AQ to 33 scenario.33 is statistically better, but I would take AQ 10 times out of 10. (Full Answer)

My daughters and I recently moved to Montreal. I am on sabbatical from my job as a professor in Vermont and I wanted them to experience everything that city life has to offer (not to mention learn French).

Cities have a sort of excess of difference that forces us to be more aware and sometimes even more tolerant.

The burgers I eat with a fork, obviously sans bun. The mayo is fine, but you are correct, the ketchup and sweet pickles are something to avoid. If they are dill pickles you ok. Pizza is something you will be making at home soon I bet either with a low carb tortilla (my preference) or check out r/ketorecipes for fathead pizza crusts and others. But in a pinch you can scrape all of the toppings off of a slice of pizza and eat them with a fork if you are out with friends or something. In Mexican restaurants go for fajitas also eaten with a fork, no tortillas, beans or rice but the guac, sour cream and pico are fine. Chinese is hard. All of their sauces have sugar. At some point you may make a stir fry served over cauliflower rice.

Study when to bet in Texas hold'em poker for a favorable blind stealing. Primarily, in a game where you happen to be a dealer and there is only the dealer and the blinds remaining to play, competing to steal such a pot is called blind stealing. With this game being positional, if you are a dealer you would be the last to act and you can take the pot of the blinds fold. A raise is going to make the blinds fold if they are in a medium position; however, if you are going to call, they may just check to see what comes up next. If you are in a dealer position and have a strong hand you can bet high and re raise, contributing to some increase in the stakes. However, this is not a big way to get rich.

Gambling regulations began to be mooted around the time of the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. The 1926 Betting Act introduced the law that anyone wanting to act as a bookmaker would have to be licensed by the government.

However, a small but significant loophole allowed for private members clubs to run table games as long as the owners did not personally profit from the gaming.

To get a sense of how soft the market is, Miller suggests examining factors beyond falling rents namely, landlord concessions. Like TV infomercial pitchmen, owners are bending over backward to sweeten deals, offering tenants longer periods of free rent, more money toward construction costs and relaxed subleasing agreements. "If you factor in the concession packages, rents are probably down 30 50 percent in high end buildings," Lewis says. One deal Colacino recently negotiated included 36 months of free rent. He also cited construction allowances from landlords that have hit $70 to $80 a square foot, double the recent industry standard. "It's historic,"Colacino says. "And I'm not even getting into the crazy landlords. There are guys who are doing more than that."

Regarding the question of how quickly you can compel them to serve you, I would expect it to take a full conversation lasting at least a few minutes. This shouldn usually be a problem, since few creatures are going to immediately attack the caster on sight, even if they are angry about being bound.

In some ways his most extreme work comes from this aberrant moment of peinture vache (stupid painting), as he called it   it's as though, in parodying other Belgian artists (Ensor, and a particularly gross comic illustrator named Deladoes), he touched a demotic rock bottom from which he could only recoil in the end.

We see that if, say, there are five seats in the EU region then any party with more than a sixth of the vote will get a seat, as otherwise the other parties need to have five piles of chips, all bigger than this pile, and that too many chips.

Edit: quite the rolling argument going on here. My reiteration of said cue was meant to be reminiscent of a director or, I guess, a conductor (for the violin analogy below).

While she was still a young girl, the family migrated to Virginia where she attended an upscale boarding school for young women until the family moved again following the silver rush to Leadville, Colorado.

I always see praise for this book, and I completely disagree, especially about the ending: It thought it was overly cheesy and saccharine.The book in general was not one of his best imo, there were parts that completely dragged (like a big section in the middle where Jake is staking out Lee Harvey Oswald by living near him) where I was having to force myself to keep reading because I was hoping it would get better.Overall I say this book is pretty overrated; it had an interesting premise and some good parts but the flaws were enough that I probably wouldn even recommend it to anyone.Same, but for the whole Sadie plotline, not just the ending.

For starters, try to avoid chewing anything in the area of your mouth where you have pain or tooth damage. And while some people may find that ice helps numb the pain of a toothache, experts recommend you avoid very cold or hot foods and beverages. If your teeth are sensitive, extreme temperatures can increase your pain. So, until your toothache improves, you should rule out hot chocolates and iced mochas. It's also best to steer clear of chewing ice, hard candy and popcorn. If you don't, you may end up with a broken tooth   a problem that can cause you even more tooth pain.

The demonstration in January and February 1838 used the Vail register (accentuated in italics in the JFI report) and did away with the Morse pendulum apparatus for recording the message this was evidently a great improvement. The first "representing numbers" were a series of dots. This is perhaps the first publication in a journal of the dot method of transcribed signals of a recording electromagnetic telegraph. The dots are pictured ". The second, "alphabetical signals are made up by a combination of dots and lines of different lengths"), an example of which is not shown. (I should point out that this article is about half the length of the JFI article.) is surprising is to see what Morse himself had to say on this issue. Here are his notes on the system of notation, from the SFB Morse papers at the Library of Congress, Manuscripts Division, bound volume 28 November 1835 18 April 1838, page 154 ("Drawings to Accompany Copy of Caveat of Oct 6 1837"). The penciled note states "this is old mode of sign and is the only specimen ever published. See the Mechanics Magazine". It was also evidently published in the American Journal of Science and Arts about the same time. There is no reference to the JFI report or the "dots" (or "1st Mode"). It may simply be the case that at the time of his writing this that Morse was simply unaware of the JFI report, as the three appearances were all published at about the same time (within weeks of one another). no expert in this field, but I haven been able to turn out any earlier use of the dots than this report. 168, and then in the Mechanics Magazine (London) for 10 February 1838.

The difference between more armor and more physical % is minimal though, my guildie Itexo has a great youtube channel where he has compared armor vs phys %, amongst other things.Your main way of healing yourself is Exura Ico and life leech imbues. If that not enough, you need to use healing potions (remember that healing/mana pots have a shared cooldown). And if that not enough STILL, you need to use ss/might rings to prevent your hp going down too fast. Knights is not a voc that dies in one hit, a good knight can get out of most situations with enough use of supplies. Remember that you can put the amulets and rings on hotkeys.I use mana/hp/crit on weapons, mana/axe fighting on helmet and life/fire protection (optional, depends on what you doing) on chest. Different equipment have different amounts of imbue slots.

I realize that $100K is a drop in the bucket in the $10billion ocean that is the US porn industry, but still, it does seem like states might be able to capitalize on this.

Something filled my heart, something that had been there, right next to the rage, ever since the day that I walked inside of the Guild Hall. For the longest time I put it aside, ignoring it, but every time I did, all that happened was it growing stronger and stronger. I thought, for so long that all that I had was my rage, the source of my power itself, but now, it was gone, and my magic along with it. Living so long with that desire to finish things, that urge for revenge, made me feel empty without it. I pushed away, feeling washed up, and burnt out.

However, it can sometimes be difficult to determine the cause of allergic dermatitis. It could be caused by a parasitic infestation, such as ringworm, ticks or mites. Sunburn can cause dandruff. Your cat could be sensitive to stress, or allergic to a new food or grooming product. It could even be due to something as simple as the air being too dry indoors in the winter. If you feel like the air is dry in your home and your skin feels dry and tight as a result, you can bet your cat is experiencing the same thing. Humidifying will not only get rid of the dry skin problem, but it will also cut down on static electricity in your cat's coat and reduce the likelihood of winter colds. This is the easiest fix for dandruff problems in cats.

Most people tend to carry stress in the muscles that elevate the shoulder blades. Sometimes, even minor "drama" cause the shoulders to creep up towards the ears! Sleep posture, carrying something frequently on one shoulder, talking on the phone without a hands free headset, or typing without having the forearms supported can cause the muscles that elevate the shoulder to go into spasm (sometimes chronically) and make it difficult to turn your head. Chronic spasms can cause the levator and upper traps to get "glued" together and restrict proper motion..

In my bit of experience working with IP matters, when you have a trademark or whatever filed, even if you get some paperwork wrong or mess up payment somehow or what have you, that mark still stays tied to the client until the application is totally dropped.

The enablers of the Legal Framework Order of 2002 that lies at the heart of Pakistan's currently mutilated Constitution are the Q League, and the religious parties.

Hello: I a manbo, and I can give you a couple tips :) Vodou is not a religion you can practice on your own; you need to be part of a community and receive instruction from a priestess (called a manbo) or priest (houngan).

My roommate has nerf wars at his job and we bought him a nerf sniper for xmas which in turn made everyone in the house (me, my husband and our 2 roommates) buy one for ourselves. So we have 4 grown ass adults with snipers that can shoot 100 ft. The scopes dont function so we went to Amazon to try and find real scopes. Cue Amazon prime so in 2 days we had functioning scopes. I walk in the door one day and got point blanked with the sniper in my titty. Needless to say it was all out war from that point we all grabbed our guns and ran outside to have proper concealment and range. So here 4 grown adults prone on the grass in our trailer park With maybe 150 darts to everyone name. It was a good day. However we did get a few side eyes from neighbors as we bolted out the house with a pouch of darts and a sniper.

Incandescence is essentially when an object is heated to a high enough temperature that it produces light, like the sun or molten metal. LED devices like those of Joovv flicker at 120 Hz, or 120 times per second whereas incandescent light bulbs stay on steadily because they use a metal filament  usually tungsten from my reading.

There is but I don't remember. Staying on Facebook(stay on the website I didn't went anywhere else) and looking for it while playing the game, you would probably find the survey. Basically all you to do was register and play two trivia games.(Didn't matter if you answered it wrong or not). At the moment I'm still trying to find a way of getting back to it. You use real money to buy poker chips, and then you use the chips to bet and call in the poker game. Once you are done playing, you go to the cashier with the chips that you have and get real cash money in return for them. I am trying to gauge your opponent's reaction. If I look him or her dead on, my opponent may be able to adjust him or herself and keep from giving away his or her tell. Now, if i am playing with your chips and checking out your opponent out of the corner of my eye (which works even better if you're wearing sunglasses like many of the pros do), he or she may not pick up on it and will give something away. It goes back to the distraction/intimidation factor. (Full Answer)

Another point to realize is poker is not suited for automated mechanical play. It is a game meant for humans. Sure, a poker bot may not put on a tilt, but neither can they spot a bluff. 
But to tax working and middle class women who have been part of the 80% of Americans getting worse off in the past 30 years is wrong. These women understand that looking better can lead to a better life. These women are poorer than they used to be. And not terribly powerful. That why they easy to single out. Why make abortion a part of health care. Or boob jobs? Like much of the health care reform being discussed, a tax on cosmetic surgery is unfair to women and unfair to the working class because they exactly who is not represented in Congress.
There are many consumer products that contain fluoride, from fruit juices to pesticides. Chances are your tap water is also fluoridated, which is somewhat of a controversial topic. Some people believe that water fluoridation can lead to a host of diseases, including some kinds of cancer, although a clear link has never been proven. They also believe that it violates the ethical boundary of medical treatment without informed consent. Considering that the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control and Prevention are behind water fluoridation, it's not likely to change any time soon.

Amazon has changed this though because now all it takes is a tiny bit of success on my part, they see that as a leading indicator, source their own competing product earlier than a typical competitor who wouldn have my sales data.

The only reason that makes more sense to me is because of the "shadows" which I realize hasn't been confirmed by anyone in LE so I guess I shouldn't keep thinking that's evidence they were still alive. Sorry for the rambling. I agree with your post about him still blaming her it's sick.
