I doubt they would sell me the House of Ludington to make into a resort spa though. That is what I would do with that hotel instead of turning it into low income apartments. Escanaba needs to get some tourists in and get some money flowing..

Honestly, the fact that he showed up with K8o means ranges were wide open and you really weren going to be able to figure out where you were in the hand being this short stacked.

Aluck119  0 points  submitted 4 days agoIt's the greatest demonstration of what happens when two dudes have a couple cool ideas but never spend a second fleshing out any of it and get a show sold and made on it. It completely ruined television for me for a long time. It was the biggest bait and switch in the history of television and rode on nothing but unfounded hype. Six seasons, 161 eps of having your balls but only the balls tickled and barely a coherent plot line between them. The entire second season was based around the concept of "the Numbers" and then it developed (if you can call it that) into this silly afterthought feeing, shit, everything that was even actually addressed felt like a silly pointless afterthought. Almost like the Matrix vs the sequels. It's also lead to all these pseudo mysterious supernatural series that just go nowhere. 525 points  submitted 6 days ago

Elevators, published by Travelers' Insurance Company, tried to protect themselves a little further by ensuring safe practices of elevator operation, mostly in industrial settings.

Edit: I didn't mean this statement to be insensitive, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone. I was making that statement thinking of the 90% of women who don't experience a serious tear and who do just require a few stitches.

There is the flipside too: Lazy "dominants." I tired of seeing "doms" who haven spent any time learning the psychological and physiological tricks of the trade. They are too lazy to do the mental and emotional work, so they say they dominant as an excuse to boss partners around. In extreme cases, they are sadists who don realize it, which is sooooo dangerous.

I tend to clam up at the poker table, terrified to say anything that'll tip others off to the strength or weakness of my hand. According to Sklansky's new book, psychological manipulation is a very important part of No Limit hold em, but as I say, I'm so terrified to say anything that I feel I am missing out on opportunites to send an opponent the wrong way. I'm hoping this forum will become the basis of a 'playbook' to help me open up more at the table.

A big part of being sold on the whole idea is that my stay would be rent free as long as I was working in the studio. It turned out the sales she brought up were pretty much her best over the years, not examples of her usual or even recent profits, and her attitude was "my money stays in my savings, (son) knows that money is there for emergencies and covers the day to day stuff.".

Our transportation infrastructure is in terrible shape. It not going to get better. A large cause of the current condition of our roads is that we are a through route for trucks that rip our highways up. Trucks pay $0 to our state for the use of our roads. Every other state on I 95 has this same issue and they ALL decided to institute tolls so that trucks pay to use the state roads. We need to get on board because right now we are just turning money away.

Physical contest or trivial pursuit? Poker faces poserA dictionary defines sport as: pursued for exercise or pleasure, usually requiring some form of physical skill, such as golf, fishing, racing, etc. A schoolteacher from Penrith who had all his financial prayers answered last year by winning a $1 million tournament at Star City casino, he says the act of sitting at a table for up to 16 hours and waiting for an opponent to falter is directly related to physical fitness.

Add salt to taste, and you have broth! To make a hearty stock, do the same with leftover bones or scraps of meat (preferably all the same kind of meat). Since you using stuff you otherwise throw away, broth and stock are effectively free. 
Battlepass usually has 2 tiers a free one and a paid one. The free one will give you a couple shit items just so that they can say they have a free one. Then they have the paid one which usually includes items "worth" wayyy more than the asking price. The whole point of the battlepass is to keep players engaged with your game. So the more you play the further you progress the battle pass. In a BR this fills in for the lack of in game progression.
The financial incentives for businesses to encourage a fun work environment are particularly striking when you compare turnover rates between employee friendly companies and ones that focus less on employee wellbeing. IT companies on Fortune's list of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" have a turnover rate of 5.9 percent, compared to 14.4 percent industry wide [source: Waggoner]. A reduced turnover rate not only translates to lower hiring and training costs, but also results in a more experienced, productive staff that is better equipped to meet the goals of the company.. 
No, /u/conspiracy pirate is right in spirit, but not in fact.

When my children ask me how someone as smart and as good as Obama could be doing these things, I answer that he is not in charge. Politicians exist to get re elected and getting re elected requires contributions from big business and big military. Obama and the US Congress don really represent the American people as much as the America corporation. Getting a decent human being into the presidency is not enough. We must reform campaign finance laws in order to effect real change.

For almost a decade, there has been a Herculean effort by people from both the Pakistani and American establishments that seeks to clean up and sterilise the narrative of US Pakistan relations based on the micro details, literally picking on the weeds.

The practice of aromatherapy, using naturally occurring scents to promote the health of the body, mind and spirit, has become a large part of the air tub experience.

Many food experts prefer to call the tomato, the "apple of love." Why is the tomato erotic? Two reasons: First of all, the sensation of eating a fresh, fully ripened, crisp, clean, juicy tomato is sexy all on its own.

It's not hard to see why the sport is so popular. After all, it's much more demanding than your neighborhood fun run, where any couch potato can show up and usually finish. It takes a higher level of commitment to be a triathlete. Just being in decent shape isn't enough. You have to be at least marginally proficient in three different disciplines   comfortable in the water, in the saddle and on the road. After stacking all three back to back to back, the sense of accomplishment goes beyond a T shirt or a finisher's medal. Calling yourself a triathlete is an ego boost you won't get anywhere else.

But what got Amit Burman into it? "I play a little bit of poker and whenever we research about the game, we found that in a lot of countries, poker is considered a mind sport, but in India, the whole perception is that it's gambling because it's played with cards. I believe the perception is primarily because of the Diwali and Teen Patti connection. I want to bring poker out of the gambling area into a sport and the first step in that direction was the league," Burman informs. Apart from Burman, Anuj Gupta and Pranav Bagai are the two other co founders of the league.
Very cute indeed. Are there any scientific studies out there to prove frogs do infact form emotional bonds with eachother? When two snakes "cuddle" like that it's not actually because they are friends but because they tolerate eachother and both want to use the same space because it's safe there or a good basking area. I would imagine it is the same for amphibians. I think we only assume they have a bond is because we think like a human.

Jukai is a ceremony in which a formal student officially takes up the 16 bodhisattva vows. For us, we spent at least a week reading, studying, and sitting with each vow; then in dokusan we would share with the teacher the way we would articulate the vow in our own words. In jukai, each vow is read, then the student reads the vow in their own words. So using the first vow as an example, taking refuge in the buddha, my own words were: I vow to choose the path of the buddha and deliberately walk it, seeking wakefulness in myself and others.

Don't Expect To See Marvel Or Star Wars In Kingdom Hearts SoonOne of the unique aspects of Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts game is that it combines intellectual property from Square Enix and Disney. However with Disney also owning other brands such as Marvel and Star Wars, we're sure that some have wondered if Marvel and Star Wars could eventually find their way into Kingdom Hearts as well. Unfortunately we might be waiting a while, if at all, because during an interview in the Ultimania book for Kingdom Hearts 3, the game's director Tetsuya Nomura was asked about the possibility of seeing Marvel or Star Wars characters in the game.

Imo he could be the best superheavy over DK in the long run, and rn he's at least the 2nd best superheavy. He still goes even or evenish with all the swordies imo (not counting ones with projectiles like tink, yink, robin, etc.) due to his crazy range and ability to catch landings which is great in a game where swordies seem to be dominating. Imo (these can certainly change over time, but these are my thoughts atm) he has even mus vs Marcina, Corrin, Cloud, Ike, and Shulk, and a possibly even mu vs chrom/roy and Link. I also think he might do better than most vs Inkling only losing to them slightly. He still loses to zoners, amazing jugglers, potent edgeguarders, and just extremely fast characters, but even his worst mus are still doable. Overall, he's much better solo main wise than he was in sm4sh, but still retains his ability to be an amazing secondary due to being a super easy to learn character that can be used as a counterpick in certain top/high tier mus.

I know nothing about agreements but I think the best way to approach this with her, if you could approach it, is that it her right to control the food in her house, but it not right for her to yell at him for eating meat any more than it is right for her to yell at him for being interested in Christian/Jewish/whatever mythology. Moreover, she may well be driving him away from her viewpoint by attempting to forbid his behavior away from her house.

Saying chemo is a death sentence in your early 70s without knowing the severity seems like scare mongering.

I would argue that if anything, it happened LESS to Muslims than to other Indian religions. The British felt some affinity for Muslims, as followers of another Abrahamic religion that revered Christ. Hindus, on the other hand, were wholly pagan and alien, the objects of much hatred and revulsion. And being much more numerous, they were more frequent targets for the British.

A female perspective/">Anal Sex from a Female Perspective describes what anal sex feels like for a woman. I am a firm believer that once a woman experiences the sensual pleasure that anal play can bring, she'll allow you to explore the possibilities a little further, and, given sufficient time and patience, will eventually allow you to take it to the ultimate step of full anal penetration.
 3 points  submitted 18 hours agosorry man, it sucks, but i know what you're going thru. A week after my 24th birthday i had to go to the emergency room due to inflammation in my ileum and got the glorious news that i have Crohn's disease! it's literally a fucking pain in the ass and i was a healthy individual before as well (played sports all thru hs and some kickabouts and pick up games after) so that was a huge blow.only thing is nobody really has that type of issue in my family, so i have no idea if it's genetics, environmental factors (huge amounts of stress) or the good lord decided to nerf me because i would've grown too powerful.either way man keep your head up. I'm halfway to 27 now so i'm not gonna give you a pep talk full of rainbows and sunshine, and instead give you the classic "Lad, it's arthritis".drop a PM if you ever feel like it.

You clearly don't understand the logistics of hosting this type of service and what a market like this requires to operate. You can't offer or provide this platform to users essentially for free, there are costs involved. How would you pay for servers to host the site? Where are you storing all the data to keep it running? That costs money too. How would you secure the site to prevent malicious parties from just stealing from people and getting around your points system? How are you expecting to run this thing when you yourself aren't getting paid a dime outside of your made up points system? Would you ask for groceries or request someone to pay your rent? Stop playing the victim card here and consider that the reason you're getting shit for this is because the idea is shit. You came here asking for an opinion. Don't get upset when you get a response different from what you were expecting.
When I say I would have gone nuclear, let me explain what 16yo me would have done in this scenario. I would have looked up whether i could override the custody arrangement given my age. Upon finding out that the answer is yes virtually everywhere, I would have gone to my dad, and asked him to call a lawyer. Then I would have asked that lawyer how to petition the court to let me ask that my dad have primary custody, and then not spoken to you for several months time. They aren upset about losing the vacation primarily, that not why I would have done that. They are upset that you are interfering with their relationship with their other parent.

But another important point is that subversion is usually used before raw force. Socialists and working class elected officials are often off by high salaries and comfortable positions. Why would such an official want to challenge their own privileged position in that case? Also, the media hegemony limits ideas that challenge the system its owners rely on. But if it has to, the ruling class will defend its own personal interest with violence. If the majority of people want to overthrow a government, then the police will be expected to stop such a movement, even if it has a huge popular mandate.

This cycle continues to feed itself so that the popularity of poker is now at an all time high.

Its so easy to get used to this faster type of play, that you can easily lose perspective on the real amount of time passed. To go to a real casino takes planning. For some of you it might entail a flight, for others a lengthy drive. The time that it takes to get to the casino can be very helpful for your mindset because it psychologically forces to give you time to prepare.

Everyone starts with 1,000 in tournament chips, and the blinds start at 10/20 (meaning $10 for the small blind and $20 for the big blind). The big and small blinds are forced bets designed to put some money at stake and stimulate betting. The players who have to contribute the big and small blinds rotate one position to the left after each hand. The big blind is usually the minimum bet at the table you are playing at, and the small blind is usually half of that amount (for instance, if the table minimum is $10, the big blind would be $10 and the small blind would be $5). The blinds raise every hour (called levels), using the following schedule:Blinds Ante 1 10/2024.

I have suffered crippling panic attacks and anxiety for the past 15 years. It comes and goes. It tends to flare up in times of great stress or when I am suppressing emotions. It seems as if she is "staying" but not staying and the anxiety is like this buffer zone that keeps her one foot in and one foot out. Frankly, I think that a great deal of this anxiety will resolve, once she is able to resolve her inner feelings. I am sure she loves you. You have kids. You have been together a long time. You love her. It must be terrifying and also guilt inducing to have thoughts of leaving. I guess I am saying that if she is having these panic episodes. IMO, for my two cents here   I don think your marital issues are resolved. Something is going on inside her   some kind of turmoil or conflict. Maybe delve into it? Is she seeing a therapist on her own. If she is not, I would suggest she see someone alone. There, perhaps she can work through what is troubling her. I think the best you can do is keep the lines of communication open   maybe get her to open up about why she thinks she is experiencing anxiety like this? Maybe   if possible   she could use some time alone   just sort of grasping at ideas. I hope you guys are able to work through this. If money is an issue   there are generally places around that offer sliding scale therapy.
There are a few LGBTQIA+ people in my extended family who had married into heterosexual presenting marriages either for survival, or because it was the path of least resistance, so I was concerned that my bisexuality would be accepted, but I may be encouraged to only encourage heterosexual relationships.

Most crucially, he adds, the United States would face the very real risk of losing MFN trading status with every foreign country worldwide. firms enjoy preferential access to these countries' markets at mostly zero or low import tariff rates, with very few exceptions. trade is with non FTA partners. "In order to accessthese markets, the United States relies on nondiscriminatory MFN tariffs, pacts that countries agree to under the auspices of the WTO. exports and could raise such tariffs to whatever levels they choose. exporters to most of the world, and on employment in those firms. would give up its right to defend the rules based system that it helped to create, losing access to an important forum for resolving trade disputes.

From where you were on the road, I dont think you could see that turning lane. And the cruiser did move over left in his lane a bit to clear the arse end of another car there, he could have moved further, he could have decided he needed to change lanes.

Without consideration of the humane practices farms arethat", says MrJournalism Has A Problem: It's Called CapitalismMuch has been written of late about the 'problems' of the Journalism industry and in particular the impacts of consolidation and layoffs on local news coverage. However, I would propose that to the extent that Journalism does in fact have a problem, that problem is simply an extension of the market failures of Capitalism. And to the extent that solutions exist, they must be solutions that allow journalism to move outside of the broken system that has caused this situation.

Pools. Visit lots of pools. If you go to Old Vegas during the day, Golden Nugget has a really cool slide in the pool that shoots through an aquarium with sharks in it.

Personally, I love tournaments. I love the festival quality that they have. However, some tournaments are awful things to attend. I recall a regular one day tournament I used to attend in London. It was in a Church hall. They could comfortably accommodate 200 competitors but instead fielded 400. There was only one toilet and the soap was usually gone by round one. It was cramped, unsanitary and poorly ventilated. I attended a few times but eventually gave up on it.

Through decades of experience as a bodyworker and an extensive study of anatomy, Myers began to notice that the fascial webbing appeared to be organized into distinct meridians, or "trains"   dense bands connecting multiple muscles and spanning multiple joints, tacked down at numerous bony "stations" along the way. If you were to think of the entire fascial network as a suit of clothing, these "anatomy trains" would be a series of elastic straps, suspenders and seams that give it structure and shape. Myers has found about a dozen of these fascial superhighways, which seem especially effective in understanding human movement and treating pain and dysfunction. Some run the length of your body, head to toe; others spiral the torso, shoot over the top of your head, and run down the middle of your back.

To our local friend surprise, Hamish Broome called him telling him he was interested in the story. Our friend asked if he knew anyone in the cult and he said he didn We wouldn have spoken to him if he did. Our friend talked with him at length about his family experience of UM damage and then passed on my contact details. Hamish Broome called me around 8:30 pm on an evening before the conference and I spoke with him for most of an hour. He began the conversation asking about the conference. I asked if he was going to run a story. He said he was looking into it. I told him the conference was backed by the Universal Medicine cult and asked if he knew who they were. He said he never heard of them. I found it difficult to believe a journalist in Lismore hadn heard of them and asked him several times through the conversation if he was sure. At that point, I wasn aware the Northern Star office is in Goonellabah, the same suburb as the UM clinic. I don remember pointing out that UM had made legal threats to the Northern Star, but by then I thought Hamish was the most dimwitted journalist I ever encountered. He is emailing me a bit and asking for my story.

I think Bernie missed his window, which feels weird saying since he was such a long shot to win the nomination two years ago. Bernie 2016 was a breath of fresh air because of the outsider y contrast he presented to Hillary, but now there are other potential and declared candidates that occupy that same niche but have more established records, a clearer story, and more charisma. I am not sure he will be more palatable this time around to mainline Democrats  while the party has moved ideologically towards him, some still hold grudges (unjustified or not) towards him for his actions in 2016.

Tillie collided with another Zag during Tuesday's practice and suffered what Few described as a "really bad hip pointer." Tillie had treatment on his hip leading up to the game and was ready to give it a go until aggravating the injury late in warm ups.
I agree with everything you've said, except that OP mentioned that he is doing this for free. For paid work I spend weeks on a logo, go back to the drawing board when needed, and create multiple versions. For free work that has already been approved, try coming up with a solution like the previous response mentioned, either the inside shape, or take just one or two of the hands to use as main logo, and hand chain as larger brand graphic. That's must mho. I've also been in this industry long enough to have free work make me extremely grumpy so I'm probably less patient with it than most people.
The Vessel, meanwhile, is truly an instant icon and so much nicer than the subway like stairways shown at its reveal in September 2016.

So the Couple should give him credit to stage such a play that has endured the test of time and survived as a timeless classic that fit in to all n sour relationships. However, the symbolic stage version of reality regarding the socio political hubbub enacted every day around us, the LUSH and US Embassy collaborative play 'Odd Couple' staged at National Art Gallery on Tuesday remained a 'low calorie diet food' for the audience used to 'foot tapping and hip swinging' blockbusters in the form of fun filled packages of hilarity and melodrama from Usama Qazi.Being a loud nation, the sleepy sloppy comedy failed to tickle our funny bones though for more serious ones and politically conscious individuals, the selection of the play to be staged at this juncture certainly raised certain questions, and the answer comes too easy. 
More pertinent to the case at hand, it worth noting that Apple and the FBI have butted heads in the courts and it has been found that the government cannot compel them to unlock phones.

I am glad this guy at least got healthy and does exercise. I got made fun of in highschool because I was "short"(I was 4 in grade 9, shortest kid in school) by an overweight girl.

If you know anyone who will be tailgating then start with that. Enjoy grilled meats and drinks. Or you can pick up a cheeky cronut from Buckeye Donuts. Otherwise, get to Varsity Club early and enjoy live music, and drinks. You can pick up food at any vendors around or on Lane. Skull Session is approximately 2hrs and 20min before kickoff. This is a must IMO. Enjoy the band, the speeches and really take in the energy before game time. You'll have time afterward to explore tailgates around the stadium/French field house. People are friendly and will typically welcome you in to join them for drinks and food. Then enter the game with plenty of time to see the ramp entrance and script Ohio. Stand, be loud, and enjoy the atmosphere. After the game explore The Buckeye Grove and look at all the All American plaques.

I studied in CBSE for 12 years, from Kintergarden to Xth and moved over to State Board (TN) for my higher secondary. From my experience, I would rate ICSE to be the toughest, followed by CBSE and State. The downside of ICSE / CBSE (esp if you happen to be in TN) is that you stand a much lesser chance of landing a seat in popular colleges (Engg / Med) since the entrance exams for these are based on state board syllabus and students from state board score much higher than those from ICSE / CBSE since they are considered on a level platform irrspective of the boards. also it is the cbse syllabus which helps one to crack all sorts of competitive exams and it brings out the true knowledge of a person.

Without even needing to think hard about this answer, I can say three countries: India, Indonesia, and Japan! If you are prepare for the culture shock, then India will charm you eventually. There is so much to explore there that you would be hard pressed to do everything! Indonesia is an amazing country, with so many natural wonders, and the country can be backpacked a budget everywhere (apart from Bali, where it noticeably more expensive). Japan is also a fascinating country, where you can explore it from Kanto all the way down to Chugoku on the Shinkansen. Unlike India and Indonesia, Japan is clean and usually safe, with a perfect tourist infrastructure. However, it will also cost you more on accommodation and transport, so if you really are on a shoestring budget, then perhaps Japan may be a little too much. Some countries are more interesting than others, but even so, if you know where to look you can avoid the larger cities and head into more rural areas in search of an authentic cultural experience. This is true of Sri Lanka, for example, where Colombo is arguably the least impressive part of the country, yet the further inland you travel, you can find ancient gems like Sigiriya andPolonnaruwa, plus amazing nature in the shape of Nuwara Eliya! My basic tip: just get out of the city!

Claiming victimhood in Lyari will resonate with Sindhis across the province. This is an exceptionally opportune thing. It isn every day that Sindhis get a headline in discussions about Karachi.

Ever since the DDB creative revolution in the 1960s, debate has raged about the best kind of messaging for building profitable brands. On the one hand, devotees of the "hard sell," or persuasion based communications, argue that facts and rational arguments sell products and services best. On the other hand, devotees of the "soft sell" contend that brands that can inspire strong emotional responses in consumers and create true engagement can transform businesses, turning the tables even on bigger competitors. In recent times the tide has begun to turn in favor of emotional engagement, with some high profile converts at Procter Gamble, but the argument is far from over.

In fact, there are not a disproportionate number of rapists among undocumented immigrants. Assertions to the contrary are racist lies that cannot be backed up by reputable sources.
