She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe de chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.

It is very easy to understand why so many people have jumped on this Mannys a juicer bandwagon. Our world has evolved into a cynical, dark place.

Soulless corporations bloody mindedly and shamelessly rape our world. These days nothing more is sacred. Nothing is as it seems. Honesty has become rarer than the finest gold.

I had a dream based on this WINGS concept photo of Yoongi. I think it was early 2017? I already told this dream once before, so I just paste most of it: my dream was like that world in the photo, everything was these deep shadows and faint glimmering colorful lights that I was floating through. Some empty buildings, some childhood sceneries   the lake at my parents backyard, under a bridge with a raging rapid, in the middle of some neverending fields. It was night all the time and the little colorful glimmers were all the light I had, all the places melted into each other and it was quiet except for a low hum all over. I had this deep love for Yoongi, I knew he was somewhere and in pain, but there was no direction or point in anything I could do. I thought I saw him in one of these abandoned industrial buildings, lying down, but the lights grew unbearably sharp and I lost my way. I found my mom and reached out to her, but she was as helpless as me and could only cover my eyes and hold me, which is when I woke up.

Before we had a chance to fully get our heads around the implications of either 1070 or of the subsequent boycott, our governor signed HB 2281, which is intended to eliminate any Ethnic Studies classes from public and charter schools in Arizona..

How come ordinary people can pay a 37% tax rate on textbooks and then a 20% tax rate on all future income earned from that initial investment? Call it "long term knowledge gains".

The economic dislocation beginning in the 1980s and 1990s began the slow, inevitable process of not only wearing down our communities, but splintering them as well.
