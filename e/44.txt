Generally, cats are thought of as being less dangerous than dogs (you don't see any front page stories about a vicious Siamese that bit the arm off some poor delivery person), and their reputation for cleanliness gives the impression that they carry no diseases at all. But in fact, most vets would rather face an angry dog than an angry cat. (Cats can bite you and slash you with all four feet.) And there are a few things you can catch from your cat.

Your response to her abuse in no way diminishes the fact that her behaviour qualifies as abuse to many or most here. We are likewise victims/survivors of the emotional, verbal, physical and/or sexual abuse perpetrated by the very people who should love us most.

In other words, your new car is all set up to communicate with the Apple devices that the auto manufacturer assumes most people have, and it doesn't really matter whether or not such an assumption is correct. Google doesn't like it because Google owns Android, Apple's main competition in the mobile device market, and accepting that iPhones deserve an automatic spot in most (if not all) new cars means accepting and conceding that Android phones do not. Why should Apple compatibility be the default and leave all the Android users out in the cold? And what can be done about it? Two good questions, really, and finding these answers is exactly why the Open Automotive Alliance (OAA) was established..

The Internet has made gambling far more accessible and, therefore, harder for recovering addicts to avoid relapse. Online casinos and bookmakers are open all day, every day for anyone with a smartphone or access to a computer. But maintaining recovery from gambling addiction or problem gambling is still possible if you surround yourself with people to whom you accountable, avoid tempting environments and websites, give up control of your finances (at least at first), and find healthier activities to replace gambling in your life.Making healthier choicesOne way to stop gambling is to remove the elements necessary for gambling to occur in your life and replace them with healthier choices.

So the implication here is that if my inference based upon race is inaccurate, then it racist? So if I inferred that this person   based on their race and age and geographic location   had been through Jim Crow era laws, and was correct, then it not racist, but if I am incorrect, and this particular person is from another country, then it racist? I sorry, I not seeing how this at all ties back to that dictionary definition of racism that you quoted at me above. Racism is the belief that certain races are superior or inferior. How does the accuracy of a race based inference have any bearing on that idea whatsoever?

Say I put a .09ohm build on some average Sony 18650.

Sorry to hear the struggle you're facing. There is a lot good advice in this thread but it can be overwhelming to listen to any good advice when you are 'inside' the situation. I mean that as you're going through this it's natural to feel cynical about the advice and think that it's easy to say something and difficult to do it. So the first thing I say you do is recognize this and know that you may feel this way. Once you do that it would be easier to sift through the great advice you're getting here and follow something that makes sense to you.

Reading a book prominently recognizing lynchings in the south, reading about how in 1963, while searching for the corpses of 3 civil rights activists the search party stumbled across the lynched corpses of 8 unreleated black men pounded home the hell out of the pervasiveness of racism helped me formulate my thoughts on how ludicrous it is to think legal changes ended racism and its impact on politics, the notion that anti LGBT bigotry ended with Obergefell is ludicrous..

Conversely, you quickly run afoul of hiring discrimination laws if you refuse to hire women for a job that simply requires a certain level of strength.

Electronic poker is very similar, except players usually do not compete from the dealer. They are dealt five cards and they can choose to discard numerous them so that you can increase their hand. The discarded cards are replaced, as well as the resultant hand determines just how much the player wins.

If you are lucky enough to have players who are experienced enough to also know how deal, see if one of them would be willing to be the designated dealer for each table. If so, automatically sit them in seat 1 in the middle of the table giving them the easiest access to deal to the entire table..

Hands end in one of three ways: one person bets and everyone else folds, one person bets on the final round and at least one person calls, or everybody checks on the final round. If everybody folds to a bet, the bettor need not show the winning cards and will usually toss them to the dealer face down. If somebody calls on the end, the person who bet or raised most recently is supposed to immediately show, or "open", their cards. They may delay doing so in a rude attempt to induce another player to show their hand in impatience, and then muck their own hand if it is not a winner. Don't do this yourself. Show your hand immediately if you get called. If you have called a bet, wait for the bettor to show, then show your own hand if it's better. If the final round is checked down, in most card rooms. everyone is supposed to open their hands immediately. Sometimes everyone will wait for someone else to show first, resulting in a time wasting deadlock. Break the chain and show your cards.

Extraterrestrial landscapes are a leap of faith based on available observations, and no doubt that the readers of the late 19th century seeing these images for the first time would have been transported by their ingenuity and depth of understanding i n representing the Earth as just another bit in the sky when it is seen from other locations. Images also led to a note about a paper that Flammarion wrote for La Nature1 in 1873 on what turns out to be the similarities of the atmospheres on Mars and Earth and that led me to a somewhat earlier paper that he wrote for the Comptes Rednus that seems to have a little more punch than the later one. The short paper in the CR2 observes that the Earth is mostly covered by water, and on Mars there is more "land/continental surface than maritime/sea surface".

I personally feel like Call of Duty will find a way to make Blackout a free to play game with more DLC / Battle Pass type stuff in the future, but that is just a guess.

I think the missionaries in Russia do not believe they are lying in any way and I not going to accuse them of such. 
I was too ignorant and conservative to accept that.

For some reason it doesn show up on the UK PCPartPicker, but it available on Amazon here. It a great board and the dual M.2 slots are really a nice feature in a small build.. 
Prices are expected to remain mostly flat, provincewide.. 
I live the life pretty much like described above. I live in the moment, try to do everything I do with love no matter if I like it or not. I get joy out of being nice. I live very simple and do not strive to own many things. I eat healthy and do some natural workout like running, jumping and lifting things. I practice meditation daily and go to zen or vipassana retreats every couple of months. Its not really rocket science but the first step in all of this is to realize that you are not your thoughts and that everything in life is a choice. Suffering is a choice and so is happiness.
So, there a couple of things that we should talk about here.
It's possible to feel at least minor allergic reaction symptoms psychosomatically. I haven't had an anaphylactic reaction that I was old enough to remember, but because I know what a reaction is supposed to feel like, sometimes I feel my throat tightening and my chin itching a little if I focus too much on an allergen or see a commercial that features it heavily.
Rebuild a couple of builds but still dud. I proceed with the demo after the 15 min break when everyone returns. 
Cool Green Country in Lismore: Cool Green Country is the official fundraiser for The Greens 2019 NSW election campaign. 
Omaha Hi/Lo: As in Omaha Hi the player starts with 4 hole cards and similarly the player can only use 2 of them. But in Omaha Hi Lo the big difference is that you can have a high and a low winner in each hand. The player with the "high hand" wins the high (hand rankings according to Texas Hold'em) and the player with nothing "low hand" wins the low. 
Etc etc etc.. 
A Nevada casino asked to offer the Oscars in 2012 but was denied. Over the last four years, Nevada regulators have allowed wagers on votes for things like Super Bowl MVP, the Heisman Trophy in college football and AL and NL MVP in baseball.. 
From the Wisconsin Criminal Jury Instructions (University of Wisconsin Law School), I share information on Third Degree Sexual Assault: Sexual Intercourse Without Consent. If you were sitting on an empaneled jury, these are the instructions, without all of the complex "legalese" that the Judge would read prior to going into jury deliberations.. 
Despite the Times slavish devotion to creating a cult of the current president (and the last one for many years), deciding between 10,000 and 40,000 is not great leadership. 
This is not because the butter doesn get incorporated with the milk. 
I love that without being snarky or looking for any sort of gain she sets the story straight when Dorinda isn't there to defend herself.. 
For the Linux boxes, I have not really worked with Linux sence RedHat 5.0 but more than likely you are going to need to get dynamic ips for those boxes and have those dial direstly to the "SERVER" that you need to use at that piticular time. 
Been around at least since the Decembrists (no, not the Indie rock group  the Russian upstarts of the 1800s). 
When Genn is an aggressive, exiled leader out for vengeance he provides valuable diversity to the Alliance cast. 
At the bottom of that list you'll probably have micro tasks (things that takes 4 hours or less to do). 
They also look at the world as two groups. Korean and Foreigners (especially the older you go). So if all Koreans are the same, then all Foreigners are the same. 
Plus curieux,  une poque assez similaire, on retrouve le clou de girofle en gypte : des colliers de clous ont t dcouverts en compagnie de momies. 
I was able to follow along easily without getting lost or confused. 
I would be physically sick and dizzy. 
I glad a man who came close to destroying a whole nation is not celebrated as a hero. Rural people are still fond of him, supposedly he wasn all bad for them. He was an insane dictator and in the end even the Chinese will recognize it.
First of all, we love a good dramatic symbol. An oil tanker spills a million gallons of oil on a beach? Ah, that's just a number. But show us a picture of an otter coated in oil? Holy shit! It's a disaster.
But you block hands like AJ KJ AT and KT. 
He was surrounded by his loving children, Susan Jeanne of Anchorage, Alaska, James Martin of Mahtomedi, Minn., and Leslie Joan of Hawaii. Larry loved being the middle son in a large family. He enjoyed all the social circles, especially the dances every weekend and all the friendships that surrounded his life. 
The underlying tissue is raised, or sucked, partway into the cup. 
Hopefully, we can transfer our knowledge in the casinos the next time we go.. 
If I was region specific the best I could say would probably be East (San Diego) County. East County is a well established term we have for the "cultural" region
Encourage him to consider the health aspects. It's difficult to think about abandoning such an ingrained habit; you can help increase the nail biter's motivation by talking about a time in your life (or better yet, in the nail biter's life) when another habit was successfully overcome. Be supportive, lighthearted, and positive in your approach, and offer to help   perhaps with "code words" if you see her start to nibble in public, or even by providing a reward.. 
Black Spruce is the largest species used, which might live to 150 yrs. Maybe. 
I think as you get elderly (40+? Lol) you can afford to throw money at some things and don't have the time for piracy, so the opinions shift.. 
"Joyce met Hemingway in Paris during the 1920s. Both renowned heavy drinkers, they began to frequent cafes and bars together. While Joyce was unathletic and had failing eyesight, his drinking companion was tall, strapping and prone to violent outbursts. 
Ma l'Amore (quello con la A maiuscola) non ha che un unico desiderio: quello di darsi, senza aspettative. Non ha importanza che poi il Sole splenda o continui a piovere, per intenderci. 
It fucked with my head a bit at the time, and I was super blue pilled.

Training runs happen most mornings after they dropped their kids off at school Henrik has two boys, Valter, 12, and Harry, 7; Daniel has two daughters, Ronja, 13 and Anna, 7, plus a 10 year old son, Erik then it time for lunch. Afternoons are housework or errands before picking the kids back up from school.up in a small city in Sweden, then to get to play over here and to get inducted, especially with the teammates who are in there already it a great honour, he said. 
TIL a man that killed his estranged wife, her daughter who was 14 months old their son who was 4 with separate knives to not "cross contaminate" their blood "allow demons inside them to live" then plucked out his own eyeballs ate them in prison was declared sane. He told the doctor he was trying to "cross over into heaven." He was referred to the mental health unit and an emergency detention order to hold him against his will was filed.

For example, Blacks GIs didn get access to home loans post ww2 because of outright racial discrimination, these suburbs that white people fled to with their home loans allowed them a drastically different life than people from the zip code next door. 
Yes, there a great mix of paces from 3hr folks all the way to 5+run/walk groups. I was in one of the slowest run groups last fall (and was usually the only guy in my group). I found that being put into a pacing group (based on recent race results) helped me with pacing issues a lot. Instead of going all out every run, I keep to the plan with the pacers who are experienced. Going by your time in Hot Chocolate, there definitely a group for you.
I been using this all year as a quick distraction from larger peojects. I can finish one of the guardians in 1 4 sittings usually, and with so few colors it gives that instant gratification I crave sometimes.
Et o, au lieu de se concentrer sur la demande, l'interlocuteur voque leur poids. Rarement de faon sympathique et chaleureuse. 
2 how much do you want to spend? There are all in one curricula that are crazy expensive, but less work for you or you can throw things together. On the same note   research some different styles of homeschooling (there is a spectrum of unschooling up to it looking like a traditional classroom at a public school). 
Istanbul isn really a mainstream destination for most Americans like it is for Europeans and therefore the few Americans that do make it here are usually veteran tourists that are aware of the basic guidelines of getting to know the customs of the country they planning to visit beforehand; but I still see a lot of ignorance on behalf of Americans when it comes to Turkey.
Maybe with some resources the biological parents could do well, maybe the mom has pp depression. IDK, I found it strange the other thread supported taking someone else's kid when the OP himself mentioned his wife probably easily convinced them. I would think there would be some steps before the baby could be yours.. 
I have a set of pictures that were taken after his death which are proof that these assholes did absolutely nothing to bring anyone to justice then.

In any case what everyone should watch out for is Scam emails and messages in facebook where you are supose to be awarded or baned for any reason, and you are asked to click a link to verify your account, where you would need to login of course; when you login to that link you don't actually verify anything you just give out your password and account to some hackers. The website may look very well like facebook or any other kind of security invented wesbite.

Like it or not, the use of drones has decimated Al Qaeda and has killed dozens of leaders of ISIS. Whether that actually useful or not, worth the price of innocent lives or not, worth sacrificing the privacy of millions of people is another debate. But personally I prefer targeted drone strikes over full scale invasions in order to find a single man, or do you think Afghanistan was a success?
Hi /u/amehrikaaa, thanks for your submission to /r/Bossfight! Unfortunately it has been removed for the following reason(s):
Chicago native Ian Schechter knows this rule all too well.
Spinal x rays are a safe and effective way to get look at your spine for damage or potential problems. Just like a dentist takes an x ray of your teeth to see if you have cavities or problems with the bones below gum line.
This reflects how manufacturers adapted to the higher dollar over the past decade. Greenback, firms hedged their exposure to the high dollar by reducing their reliance on exports and increasing their use of imported inputs. This hedge reduced the net exposure of manufacturing firms to exchange rate fluctuations by almost ten percentage points in the past decade. 
I had a customer who was buying Green and Red Grapes at SCO. I guess she was checking the price for them on the scale so I walked over to her and told her that they had to be weighed separately because they had different PLU and therefore different prices. 
Apple user since 2011. But I have a pixel 3 for work travel (google fi works in 140 countries so its really easy to just turn on and start using it) .

Different notes require different angles, because like all wind instruments, not every note will be in tune at the same time. 
Lawyers that only deal with them, that get to decide if you need extra therapy, the DOT which depending on the state has a whole other bag of shit to feed you, in my state the DOT just takes your license for being charged, no conviction required and you have to jump through the hoops of getting a barely functioning breathalyzer. 
Complaint: last night after strength training, I took off my shoes for some yoga/stretching. My dog was bothering me and clearly needed to go out, so I got up off of the floor   and promptly kicked an 8 lb dumbbell in mid stride. I broke my freakin toe, you guys.
I been flipping through the book while listening to my voicemail. A really close friend had just been killed by a drunk driver, and me   ready to fuck my way to a world record I listening to it once, like I have to replay this I must be crazy he must have said she NOT dead and the second time around, all I hear is the kid wailing in the background. And a screaming baby. 
In fact, nothing like this in the world exists. So we have literally introduced the league format in poker. 
It brings back something to make me smile. I wish my kids could experience school like I had. 
The fantasy was of having the enemy mind go kaboom from being torn between attacking nobody but the paladin and yet attacking everybody sans paladin. 
He makes lofty promises. 
You know, over the years when this has popped to mind I thought about why I didn call the police. And I would like to believe that it because I didn know where the nearest police station was and I didn want him to feel threatened and get angry. The truth is a lot worse though: I didn want to look like a bitch/a stupid little girl over reacting. My parents were already worried about me doing this drive alone and I guess I wanted to prove that I wasn a little kid anymore who screams when someone says "boo". It was pure 19 year old stupidity. If this has happened now, when I less afraid of how people will judge me and when I finally realized my own safety is more important than seeming rude, I sure this would have played out differently. A lot of girls get hurt because they don want to appear rude. That been a major tactic of kidnapped and killers forever, luring women in by asking for help and making them feel bad for saying no. And I want to be kind, and I want to help people, but because of a tiny number of assholes I now have to say no for my own safety. Because even though 90% of the time they won attack me, that 10% still exists. And that sucks.

Thanks. 
It been years and I can remember if he got sucked out on or if it was just a cooler like set over set or whatever. I just know he lost again in a big pot with a good hand. 
Is this no limit tournament style play, or a limit cash game? Strategy between the two can be wildly different. I am a reasonably competent (but by no means great) no limit player, but I am worthless in a limit game (I just don't have a good feel for it). As a general rule, though, don't bluff. 
But I guess it was just about her being."a drunk and a slut"? It was weird that "dangerous" was used more than once to describe her if that all it was, I thought.
