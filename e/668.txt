Literally none of your points are touching on any of mine. You don seem to be able to argue the ideologies but only the effect of the ideologies. You seem to think they are some how synonymous which I don understand at all. I am not interest in going through history and and comparing people who claimed to have followed each ideology because as I stated many times, people can say one thing, but act a completely different way. The only two people who can do this, as I have pointed out millions of times but you avoid like the plague, is Mohammed and Jesus. My argument is centered around comparing the lives of these two people because on the most basic level, these are the people each respective religion followers are suppose to emulate. You are familiar with WWJD wrist bands? However, you call it arbitrary when they literally are the MOST IMPORTANT figures of these religions and then you go on and talk about how people interpreted it like somehow their lives a better example of the ideology than the actual figureheads of the respective religions. Come on that ludicrous.

The place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse. On reaching the copse, Levin got out of the trap and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, already quite free from snow. He went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side, and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch, he took off his full overcoat, fastened his belt again, and worked his arms to see if they were free.

Remember that the bet following/on the river (the 5th community card) is the most important. This one must be powerful and intimidating. When the opponent checks, and then it comes to you, you can place a large bet to get the opponent to call or fold. If a player bets in front of you, there are two things you can do. If s/he bets small, your making a significantly larger bet might push him/her to fold. However, if the opponent makes a large, bluff like bet, your best chance to bluff would be to call (less risk)   or go all in, especially if you have a lot more chips than the other player. Consider, it is better to push all in by betting than by calling, since you want to look strong to have more impact. The best feeling in poker is deciding someone is bluffing and taking down a large pot with a bluff of your own, causing the first bluffer to fold, and no one ever knows whether either or both of you were bluffing.

I had a very similar experience when I went last July (2018). I went with my wife and 3 friends (5 of us total). We were staying for 8 nights. We booked an Airbnb for our first 2 nights in Havana before we got to Cuba, but didn book any other accommodations ahead of time. While we were in Cuba we found it incredibly easy to book our Airbnbs. It allowed us a lot of freedom to adjust our trip based on what we found out we wanted to do once we got there.

Explanation of white privilege that resonated with me was that we playing the game of Life on easy mode. That doesn mean that it isn challenging or that you are going to automatically win or have anything handed to you. You will have to fight for everything you get and you will feel satisfied if you are successful at the game. But, everyone else (non cis white males) are playing on hard mode. It takes more effort to achieve the same result, and there are more obstacles to overcome along the way. You both have to master the boss fights, but they came into the room at half health, so to speak. Analogy helped me understand that it wasn an attack (necessarily) when someone spoke about my privilege.

The situation that resulted in Cuba, of course, with inspired revolution, also points to the fine line the United States occasionally had to walk. The general instability of a number of countries in Latin America was an awkward problem, with several of them having recently gone through revolution, if not then caught in the middle of civil war themselves. Venezuela, Colombia, and Bolivia were all in the midst of political instability, with governments elevated by coup or revolution, and while having no desire to alienate them, for the US to recognize them might give unintended moral aid to the Confederacy. The biggest example is in Caracas. When the American Consul Henry T. Blow, arrived in Venezuela in November 1861, as instructed he declined to present his credentials to Gen. Paez, who recently had overthrown the legally elected President, but did his best to maintain good social relations. A year later, his replacement, Erastus D. Culver, however had no instructions and chose to recognize the Paez government, which forced Seward to repudiate his actions in a tip toeing communication about the United States not in domestic disputes and creating a fairly tense situation between the Consul and the government, only finally resolved after a peace treaty, and eventual new constitution, was signed in 1864, allowing credentials to be (again) presented with Washington blessing.

I don like having to post about it either but it is something that has to be done if we even want a glimmer of hope that the people voice will be heard. If people didn post about it when all of this discussion started, none of us would even know it was happening and the government would have just secretly let the ISPs do whatever. I not dumb enough to think that my voice or posts alone will change anything but I do know that Americans need to know about something that will affect their daily life and their wallet. If enough people speak up and spread awareness, there a slim chance that something may change. If nothing changes, then at least the world will know that Americans protested it and the government gave us a big middle finger. Either way, doing something is better than doing nothing.
One specific case where I seen a practical difference is when there is a mix of AXI Lite and AXI slaves. Putting all of the AXI Lite slaves on the same interconnect will save a ton of resources in the couplers. For example, in that reference design there is an option in the AXI CDMA to choose an AXI Lite or AXI interface for the control registers. I think you find that the savings in couplers on the driving interconnect more than makes up for the cost in the peripheral complexity on the CDMA. Using a 1:M interconnect for the (M 1) AXI4 slaves and a single port to a secondary (1:N) interconnect for the AXI4 Lite slaves can save a ton of resources.

It bears mentioning at this point that if you are the first person that's going to be betting you can do what's called a "check." This means that you don't want to make a bet, but you don't want to fold just yet.

Gonzaga's offense kept it interesting, with the help of numerous careless turnovers by the Tar Heels.

Dad favorite contact cleaner was Ronsonol cigarette lighter fluid. Put a few drops on a strip of paper, slide the paper between the contacts, press the contacts together, and pull the paper out. It might take a few tries but unless the contacts were badly burned (more likely to happen in relays) it didn need anything more abrasive than that. I used WD 40 in a pinch to clean contacts that way but the lighter fluid worked better.

I know how it is and it really sucks because you feel so guilty for having these feelings. But it passes. I think it's to do with what a huge change it is   getting a dog is like having a stranger move in with you. It's a bit awkward because neither of you really knows how to act around each other but at the same time you want to please. 
There was Ace, the man with the plan. He was a born leader, a result of years of careful breeding by his noble family. Of course, he had left that behind to pursue our common dream, using his abilities with a rapier to skewer any opponents that stood in our way. His confident and sly smile was infuriating to glance on, until you realised that it wasn't meant to be serious. Then, there was Nova, a far too hot headed mage, that flung time and reality spells with no abandon in the middle of a fight, and didn't stop until she ran out of mana crystals. It was a good thing that she knew a lot of top level spells, and while I had no clue at all where she had learned them, I had since decided not to continue to try to find out. As she always said, a girl's got to have some secrets. Next up, was Rose. She was a warrior unlike any other, in a suit of shining armor, with a buckler on her wrist, and a sword in her grip, striking foes around her with a colossal strength and endurance. Most wouldn't think that the quiet girl was capable of putting up much of a fight at all, but out of all of us, her fighting spirit seemed the most unbeatable.

Let us look closer at the two words Jesus used in Revelation to define lukewarm. He said that because the Laodiceans were "neither cold nor hot" (v. 16), they were sickening to Him. Many people have interpreted this as saying that God wants us either hot, on fire and saved, or cold, lost and on our way to hell. But that is not true. God never wants people to be lost and on their way to hell. That is the reason He gave His only begotten Son to die on the cross.

But honestly for me this question is hard to answer. I think I feel sexual attraction sometimes. Usually it more the idea of attraction that I attracted to. It sounds weird and is a bit difficult to explain. There are persons and actors who I think are attractive in a sexual way. But these sexual thoughts I have are kinda abstract I guess. When it comes to real life situations I usually feel like the other person might as well be a stone. I thought maybe I have some freaky kind of anxiety or whatever mental problem but I don think it something like that. I had a second date the other day and the guy was really great. Like Let But when we kissed it gave me the feeling like I was kissing my best buddy. It was just odd and nothing else. And I don want to get sexual with persons I don feel comfortable with. As someone that pretty far towards both, you sound somewhat like me. You not sexually and romantically dead, but those feelings just don do what they should do to you. I know with me, I basically have to force myself to have sexual thoughts(but I do find certain people and actions sexually pleasing). Romantically, it takes something special for me to really be attracted to you enough to even think about asking you out. And kisses might as well be hugs.

Rewording your statements to say "Only women can bear children" or "Only men can inseminate women naturally" is wrong if you accept that trans women are women and trans men are men. If you accept that, if you believe you should call trans people by the proper pronouns, if you think that for non medical purposes we should identify trans people as the gender they identify with, you will inevitably include people in the category of who have vaginas and ovaries and people in the category of who have penises and testicles. If you going to be inclusive in that regard, you might as well be willing to be accurate in your language to include the 2.1 million men and women for whom statements like have penises and have vaginas simply aren necessarily true..

Boys require rough play, they also see their fathers and older peers as role models in ways that they do not view their mothers or sisters. Young boys enjoy working on complex projects, and they like watching their role models execute these projects with skill. They also do exceptionally well in teams, unlike girls, and they learn much better when surrounded by like minded individuals with a common goal. Boys open up and leave their emotional shells when working with other boys. This does not happen when working alongside girls.

No matter how inexperienced you are, Video Poker is one of those games that you can actually beat using no more than the basic strategy and some common sense. As fun as this game can be (strategy wise), some monetary incentive every now and then can hurt, which is why it is always recommendable to learn a few tricks of the trade before you start playing with the big boys. Fortunately, you will not be required a face of steel and a master in psychology to play the video variant of the game. With video poker, you are your own biggest opponent and the machine is just a reflection of your skills and, most of all, the game choice you made. Since there are different Video Poker variants, most seasoned players would start by recommending a full pay or 9/6 payout machine, where the payout ratio for a full house is 9 to 1 and 6 to 1 for a flush.

But it wasn just the right that brought down ACORN. was mainstream media that circulated O work as if it were journalism when they would never circulate Sacha Baron Cohen work as if it were journalism. it was Congress willingness to defund ACORN, despite evidence and constitutionality, that destroyed the group. the people in charge in Washington and in the press are uncomfortable with the promise of radical democracy that ACORN represents.

While I do believe that education should be free if a government wants productive knowledgeable citizens, the main issue in the current system, I feel, is making 18 year olds choose their futures with no real advice on making college more affordable or what other options exist (picking a state school, going to community college first or just getting a CC degree, picking practical careers or having realistic expectations about the chances of succeeding in the impractical ones).

I saw many people, who place side bets on someone, who is winning. However, the problem is that when you see someone, who always wins, you place higher side bets. Nevertheless, what if he loses the next round and you placed too much money? Then all you can say is goodbye to your cash. When you know the house edge of the game, you can forget about side bets, as they do not bring you a profit.
Also you should be checking a lot of A high on flops so while it counter to conventional wisdom, the PFR actually has FEWER aces on the turn/river if playing optimally once a flop bet goes in (hence why pio would be telling you not to spaz out on those cards).
I would know. CollegeHumor has experienced great and not so great outcomes with pay walls.In 2016, we launched "Bad Internet," one of the first scripted shows on YouTube's Premium subscription service. We sprung it on our fans, shoved a trailer in their feeds and simply asked them to pay. We overestimated ourselves: Even though the show was beloved behind the pay wall, it converted new subscribers poorly.When we set our sights on launching CollegeHumor's comedy subscription service Dropout, we needed a plan that earned the trust of our skeptical audience and got them excited to pay for content they already received for free.With these objectives, we launched a campaign built around a longtime CollegeHumor Illuminati gag.

The promotion is not everlasting. After your 2 weeks expire you will have to decide what to do: to continue playing as VIP or return to Basic. If you select to continue, you will have to pay subscription fee which is not big. It starts at $19 per month. It's the only way to maintain VIP status. If you don't want to continue as VIP, you can return to your Basic account and continue as Basic member. In this case, all VIP privileges will be locked for you until you buy subscription. If you are skilled player you will most likely win money there. But what to do with money then? The answer is: you will be able to withdraw the money you have won during this VIP Trial period. That's great! Just imagine, you receive 2 weeks of VIP access for free and you can take ALL your winnings with you after the promotion ends.

I've played in several different poker rooms over the years from Las Vegas to Atlantic City. This poker room for now is all electronic with no live dealers.

The dissenters, also claiming fidelity to history, said the amendment was meant to ensure that states could raise militias to confront a too powerful federal government if necessary.
