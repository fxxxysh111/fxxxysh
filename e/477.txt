I would say treating words as "atomic" when first learning a language is pretty natural. We tend to look for literal translations between languages so you feel like you fully understand what is being said. I don't think it's a bad thing though. It's how you start to relate to a language. After studying for a 3 4 months now, I'm starting to get a feel for the nuance of German. What prefixes tend to do to verbs, similar to how they function in English. Or how meaning is conveyed with filler words like, "doch" and how it impacts the meaning of a sentence using context. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you can't expect new learners of a language to not treat words as, "atomic." It's natural, if learners stick to the language then they will start to understand the nuances that make any language colorful and unique. Just my two cents. 5 points  submitted 8 hours ago
This part is for those people who are not big fans of the Texas Hold em poker game variety. If you are already a fan of Holdem, then it doesn't matter that your online site offers more variety.

Remember the circular motion helps to distribute the caffeine to eliminate cellulite and varicose veins.

One of the Texas Hold Em strategies that you should always practice whenever you play is for you to have enough discipline. No matter how skilful you are, if you lack discipline, then, you might as well say goodbye to the thought that you can win at Holdem. For instance, when all the signals tell you not to tilt, but you still tilt, then, that means that you have to improve on your discipline. Remember this too: if playing Texas Hold Em requires you to have discipline, a Texas Hold'Em game also requires you not to play when you're emotional. Making a move based on your emotions will only cause you to make mistakes.

The public service wants to present as a modern efficient place to attract top talent but isn't willing to do any of the actual work to make it happen   like modernizing systems, permitting regular telework, and fostering an actual flexible workplace that comes with the modern 2.0 or gcworkplace style environment..

However, there are many pros and cons to being a massage therapist. It is not simply a matter of getting paid to rub someone's back and shoulders. Without proper training, an individual could literally kill another person by giving an improper massage. No one becomes a highly paid, well trained massage therapist overnight. It takes many months of training, as well as many hours of hands on experience. Therapists have to know basic physiology and anatomy, record keeping, and business ethics, as well as have people skills.

Honestly, I don think there enough information.

I assuming (because I acted this way before) that he catches winds of motivation, energy, and optimism, and those are the times in which he asks you to help him out and to remind him of his goals. 
The book is not a story about a man seeking vengeance against all of his conspirators nor is it encouraging it. In fact, it discourages it, as it is about a man who pursues vengeance so much that he loses his humanity, ruining innocent people, and then realizing the consequences of vengeance upon both others and himself.

I had to cycle through so many different jobs so far while going back to school. I don mind working through school and everything, but it hard to find a job that will pay for school/rent/bills/food and give me a schedule that fits with the classes I have to take, especially the further I get along in my major and have higher level requirements that only have one section at the most inconvenient time and the professor has it dialed in to be at that exact time every semester..

College has become a product sold to students and their families as the "perfect educational experience." The perfection of this experience involves a physical plant where not a flower is out of place, dorm rooms nicer than my house, and cafeterias, I mean "dining halls," with much nicer food than most Americans have access to.. 
Whatever it means, it certainly is a sign that elite educational institutions in the US are now easily branded something the schools themselves are constantly trying to do anyway.

4) For me, I like to always carry a sniper so I can see farther as I travel, then I like having an assault rifle in my second slot and an smg/shotgun in the third. This means as opponents get closer I wheel mouse down, and having a gun for every range is nice. I always upgrade for color, but I find the AK47 does the most damage for ARs, the Pump does the most damage for shotguns, and i like the P90 for smgs, so i prioritize those over others.

If ads were different colors on different subreddits, I think that would be even more confusing. If a certain subreddit were to use a certain color for important posts or megathreads, and another subreddit uses a similar shade for ads, then a user that spends the majority of their time on the former subreddit visiting the latter subreddit would be attracted to looking at the ads first before any other post.

Why? No border is ever fully secure. Have a look at the US Mexican border, even that is crossed illegally pretty much all the time.

The Wire Act forbids business from using a wire communication facility to assist in placing bets on any sporting event or contest.

Me going no contact really drove the point home. I know most people aren so lucky.

No doubt there is some serious and useful information in this little undated (ca. 1945/6) pamphlet mostly I guess its purpose was fulfilled in its attempt at softening the dread of nuclear holocaust in that there was actually something that could be "done" in the event of an attack. addresses the standard fears, and perhaps the standard fears of hope, though the pamphlet does paint a profile of possibility for a post attack scenario that is, shall we say, a little optimistic. any event, I share this now for the graphics, and the Manhattan Destroyed map.

Until that happens, poker players will hold accountable those ultimately responsible for this outrage: Obama, Holder and those in Congress who resist poker licensing legislation.

Nance, who also stars in the film, is plagued by unrequited romance and the asymptotic nature of human relationships. Self absorption, as it turns out, is the stuff of aesthetic exuberance.

El Sayed , and Amal Kaddoumi Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Louisiana at Monroe, 1800 Bienville Drive, Monroe, Louisiana 71201, United StatesOleocanthal, a phenolic component of extra virgin olive oil, has been recently linked to reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by accumulation of  amyloid (A) and tau proteins in the brain.However, the mechanism by which oleocanthal exerts its neuroprotective effect is still incompletely understood.Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for the potential of oleocanthal to enhance A clearance from the brain via up regulation of P glycoprotein (P gp) and LDL lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1), major A transport proteins, at the blood brain barrier (BBB). Results from in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated similar and consistent pattern of oleocanthal in controlling A levels.In cultured mice brain endothelial cells, oleocanthal treatment increased P gp and LRP1 expression and activity.Brain efflux index (BEI%) studies of125I A40showed that administration of oleocanthal extracted from extra virgin olive oil to C57BL/6 wild type mice enhanced125I A40clearance from the brain and increased the BEI% from 62.0  3.0% for control mice to 79.9  1.6% for oleocanthal treated mice.Increased P gp and LRP1 expression in the brain microvessels and inhibition studies confirmed the role of up regulation of these proteins in enhancing125I A40clearance after oleocanthal treatment.Furthermore, our results demonstrated significant increase in125I A40degradation as a result of the up regulation of A degrading enzymes following oleocanthal treatment.In conclusion, these findings provide experimental support that potential reduced risk of AD associated with extra virgin olive oil could be mediated by enhancement of A clearance from the brain.Curr Pharm Des.

Being uneducated about this, I have a hard time grasping exactly how this is the best guess for what happening in the universe. Most of what we know is based on the light we capture from these distant objects correct? But the distance between the two points is so astronomical that basically everything we seeing is old, old, old information. How do we know that the light disappearing from objects being further apart(expansion of space, not the actual objects moving as you say) isn just light being dissipated by something in between over time?.

The truth is that the symbolic weight of lynching is too great in American society to not rear its ugly head on a regular basis whenever white privilege feels threatened.

How many times have you seen mindless under control? It either been Eren scream minions or Zeke slaves so far. While both types act on command, we haven had a case like this before where the controller has been in mortal danger/unconscious while the controlled mindless were around. Zeke slaves are a whole other beast(no pun intended) due to basically being infused with his genetics. There still a lot we don know about titans, titan biology, and especially titan psychology. There no reason to believe this Zeke slave wasn compelled to come to its master rescue and give its life to revive him. In terms of the healing ability itself, while we haven seen it we can say for sure it not a normal titan thing, for all we know the founding titan or Zeke could have easily commanded their controlled titans to do this if they knew it was possible. Zeke could have potentially used a titan slave at Shiganshina to heal up faster like this if he gave the command. The transfer of flesh is a very common thing in the relationships between shifters, their titan and human forms, and mindless as well.

Have you not been paying attention to the widening income inequality gap over the last half century? In the mid  executive compensation was around 20x that of the average worker; it now over 300x. Since the mid to late worker compensation has largely stagnated. Then there the fact that the wealthiest top 1 percent in the US controls over 40 percent of the wealth. Meanwhile, with independent contractor positions being the fastest growing segment of the labor market, workers have less bargaining power than since the Gilded Age, which isn going to be helped, at all, with increasing automation. Even many current positions that require university degrees won be spared the trend towards automation. In which rose tinted world are you living?
