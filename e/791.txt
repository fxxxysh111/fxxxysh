This system lets us pick an option that a majority prefers and still give more than two options which is good, because nearly all the options we put in the poll came directly from a feedback thread we ran a few weeks before the vote itself.I avoided this asking in a public thread because I didn want any to deal with any tumblr style downvote mobs or lynchings, but is there a reason why Pokemon arts and crafts aren their own sub? I mentioned this in the survey thing before the vote was held, but I stated that in my opinion, the majority of threads in any sub should be discussion threads and it looked like every other Pokemon subject has that except for arts and crafts.At this point, all of the subreddit rules are supported by community votes.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom peddled by Citibank salesman pretending to be economists, and World Bank economists, pretending to be human   Pakistan can survive without bailouts. Reduced public sector expenditure, increased revenue mobilisation and a government held accountable at the local, provincial and federal level are not just mantras   they matter.

But it is not.On October 28, 2008 (almost exactly a year ago), I argued that Pakistan must default in order to break out of a cycle that sustains the elite's largesse to itself.

I hate that I can't trust people. I want to trust people and believe in the good in others, but I just feel like I can't nowadays. Like for instance, the other day I parked my car somewhere and later had that feeling of anxiety, 'did I remember to lock my car?' and couldn't let that feeling go to where I felt the need to go back to make sure I had locked it. That I can't even trust people enough in my community to maybe leave my car unlocked for a couple hours.

He supposedly augmented his tuition via savvy poker playing. Whatever the truth of such Kluge told tales, he would repay Columbia which now calls him a "Horatio Alger for the Twentieth Century" many times over by pledging $400 million for scholarships to be paid posthumously.

Furthermore, using the redundant english name has the benefit of being a useful name for both the informed and uninformed, while using the korean version without a suffix only serves its purpose for the informed.

Don't buy into casino mapping. Sure, casinos employ a certain level of strategy in placing their slots, but each one varies and it's not something so simple as to be understood with a quick glance or paragraph. What's more, with technology nowadays, they can change a machine's payout at the click of the button. So before you go asking that cute hostess where you should play, think again.

L'olfactothrapie vise non seulement  calmer les insomnies,  apaiser les excs, cela l'aromathrapie classique peut s'en charger. Bien plus, l'olfactothrapie permet une communication avec notre propre inconscient tout en s'affranchissant des conditions limitantes du cortex, le sige de la raison. Cette technique permet donc une meilleure connaissance de soi en autorisant un retour rflexif sur nos propres motions et sentiments.

In the US we have what's called Shopkeeper's Privilege, which says a shopkeeper or his agent may detain a suspected thief if the suspicion of theft is reasonable. It also says the detention must be carried out in a reasonable manner, for a reasonable amount of time, and only for the purpose of investigating or summoning police. It seems like everyone acted within their bounds in this situation.

Phil was equally outraged about what went on at Full Tilt, and still has a strong reputation in the poker community (both Dan Colman and Brian Rast, our two other pro were very excited to work with Phil).

Bij het stadhuis (ingepakt voor renovatie  > de Russen zorgen dan telkens voor doeken waarop het gebouw toch afgebeeld staat, wel een goed idee) kregen we een hele uitleg bij het Yuri Dolgoruky standbeeld (stichter van de stad), natuurlijk een fontein, en een standbeeld van Lenin op het Tverskaya plein. Verder langs de drukke straat kwamen we nog bij de Eliseevskiy Shop: nog een hele oude shop (19de eeuws interieur) zeer indrukwekkend en nog steeds in gebruik als supermarkt. Misschien toch wel de leukste ontdekking van de dag.

Whenever there is water escape of either clean water from a broken pipe or grey water from a tub or toilet, immediately activate restoration services and call the insurance company. In addition to health and safety issues, water left in wall and ceiling cavities will result in long term damages to suites and common areas, especially in wood frame construction. I recommend that all owners, landlords and tenants purchase condo insurance for their personal contents, living out expenses, betterments to strata lots, personal liability, liability for an insurance deductible if you are responsible for a claim, and damages to their suite that may occur under the deductible amount..

I been punched in the face by a black guy in a random attack. I spoken to (Pakistani) corner shop owners, who stated as a simple fact that 99% of trouble, violence, and shoplifting in his store was black people. I sure this is considered wildly racist and insensitive, but I don really care as it 100% accurate.

Because she and others are able to actually shoot down the accusations beyond just Tweet shouting, "Witch Hunt!!!", where actual multiple indictments, with prison sentences have been handed down in regard to Mueller investigation, which is singular in scope. The GOP controlled Congress abrogated its oversight obligations during Trump first two years in office, and what we seeing now is a correction, especially as it may pertain to what hooks foreign interests have in Trump and his clan. It would helped if Trump had released his tax returns and had divested himself, or put into blind trust, his business interests..

All of them were touched by "God" and attempted to translate what they saw in the eternal into the discrete and depending on the time, culture, environment, the translation was affected by the vocabulary and linguistic styles of the people they were a part of.

Players at that stake (if they are even around) are the most qualified to answer that question, but since you asked it here where the quantity of them may be low, I will offer a guess. 
And the outcome is the same. Bureaucracy is part of it, another is performance theater ( they can sell to the customer or investor that they have a department for this and one for that and it looks all official ) but the biggest blunder in my opinion is disconnect between management and the ground troops.

It should be a really low chance like 0.01%, that way only a very small amount of people would experience it. Once word gets out people will most likely think it a bug that is only happening to a small amount of people with seemingly no commonality between the victims. Give the playerbase just long enough to be intrigued by it and everybody starts trying to figure out wtf is going on and then patch it out and don tell anybody, then millions of people will be trying to figure out a bug that doesn exist.

Etc?The simple field tests I mentioned, and thermal imaging are probably best   thermal imaging has the potential to expose a problem (or more accurately an area of injury) which hasn been considered or which was erroneously ruled out. X rays for those problems would require recumbency (putting her totally under and laying her down), but the catch 22 is those injuries are also likely to be seriously aggravated as she wakes up and tries to get her footing (I personally had a horse break his leg waking up after colic surgery, requiring his euthanasia   and he was even in a recovery room purpose built to prevent injuries as they come out of anesthesia), so tbh I wouldn recommend radiographs unless your vet it super confident it can be done safely.Honestly, aside from thermography your best bet for deciding neurologic vs mechanical injury might be a course of strong anti inflammatories and Robaxin (or similar muscle relaxer) for a week, followed by a dose of analgesic (one which provides good relief of pain without significant motor impairment) and concurrent lameness exam. If she shows significant improvement in the areas of short striding, holding her head to the right, holding her tail to the left, and/or willingness to bear weight on the leg, then very likely you have a pain issue. 
My wife made me a similar thing for Christmas a few years ago after I finished Majora Mask.

To ensure that the country most sensitive duties are carried out only by people loyal above all to the nation interest, federal rules say contractors may not perform what are called "inherently government functions."

In a game of political poker brinkmanship Zuma has not played his best cards yet in a counter offensive. He is playing carrot stick with those in his own party, rewarding them for loyalty but threatening to expose their own corruption scandals if they appose him. Zuma can nationalize all white owned farmland distribute it to the masses of impoverished black South Africans for subsistence farming, a highly popular move which will instantly transform Zuma from villain to hero for many, albeit it will destroy the agricultural industry land banks. With popular support now behind him, Zuma can then go for broke defy the constitutional court go for 3rd term as president, cancelling or rigging national elections. The justice system has been toothless in arresting him dragging his ass in handcuffs to court, mass protests even ANC critics have not been able to dislodge him Zuma remains defiant arrogant like a traditional Africa dictator of another failed state, with him his henchmen looting the treasury, which is where his ambitions lie.

2.) Requested by u/JesusK, I checked the favorite shows of 2018 for all the different age ranges. As this would have been too much to write in this post, I uploaded an image, which shows the Top 10 for the different ranges. JoJo and Violet Evergarden seem to be a bit less favored by the older weebs, which I wouldn have guessed. But keep in mind that the higher age ranges have less respondents, which makes them more receptive to variance.
What i loved the most was past the super aggro attitude and horrorcore lyrics (which were all enjoyable in themselves), the production and songwriting were genuinely engrossing, they conjured up some ridiculously mean hooks and MC Ride is a genuinely proficient, talented rapper.

Before you sign up, though, you should read the fine print and understand all the details about joining the online casino site. You must also educate yourself on the details of the casino bonus offers you are about to receive, such as how to avail of that offer once you sign in.

The mystery has been drawing a moderate amount of attention ever since. Along with Hance and other interested parties, Reddit has been tinkering with the mystery, but to this day there is no conclusive breakthrough. Some say (and Occam's razor strongly suggests) that a local eccentric lawyer, who has allegedly been placing the ads for at least a decade but claims to work for others, is the person behind the "secret society." Others speculate that either Hance is in on the con or this is a wacky long con that members of the university have been keeping up for decades to mess with people, and a bunch of students and professors are having a ball at Hance's expense. As for Hance himself, he claims he has been bombarded with over 100 emails, courier packages, phone messages, and even small donations from the people behind the ads over the years. He seems convinced that the ads are actually communication between members of a possibly vast secret society of intellectual dissidents, and something potentially sinister is at hand.

I lived on El Camino Real in San Carlos, right across the street from the train tracks and wasn't bothered. The trains don't run throughout all hours of the night, and there aren't much in the way of freight trains like there are in the East Bay. Further, if you're moving into a place with double paned windows, you shouldn't have to worry much about noise, at all. This I know from experience, having grown up in Millbrae, right under the windy day landing path for airplanes arriving at SFO. In the '80s the noise was oppressive and complaints abounded. Then, in exchange for signing a waiver regarding lawsuits based upon noise from the airports, double paned windows were provided and installed free of charge. Suddenly, no more bothersome noise within the house.

He mentions Xanex, but that used to treat anxiety and panic disorders and seroquel which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and I believe both are banned substances unless you get an exception by the NFL by doctors recommendation (I know Xanex is). I agree with him weed should be legalized and it is probably better to be hooked on weed than painkillers. The opioid crisis is a major epidemic in this country, and there isn a clear solution to it, but one thing that needs to happen is doctors need to be more responsible in prescribing it, which has started occuring.
If you play against the same opponents regularly then you probably know their tells and the way they play. And as a result, your game is different to the way you would play, say for example, in a casino against strangers. Reading your opponents is actually a skill that not all of us can master. That is why it is a must to achieve this.

It really hard to compare because they almost entirely different IMO. Live cash is much "easier" to beat than a lot of online games but you just have to know how to make the correct adjustments to exploit the mistakes that live players so often make.

If you on a low level route you probably start meeting people just as you arrive and see them in gradually worse state as you cross to the east coast   it can be nice to have a little camaraderie as you cross rather than being totally isolated.was an interesting year as the first two days were straight rain and then basically none the last 12. 25% off folks had to drop out due to foot problems from the switch of fully soaked feet to persistent heat.I would highly recommend some Leuko tape, multiple pairs of socks, and rain pants.

A craps turn begins with an initial or "come out" roll, in which the player tries to establish a "point number" that is, when the dice add up to four, five, six, eight, nine or 10. Once that happens, the player must roll the point again before throwing a seven, which is statistically the most likely outcome on a pair of dice. If the player rolls a seven before the point, the turn ends.

Looks like it probably some sort of bot that is at least attempting to post an HTML formatted list of links that are all titled for massages or pools in different towns in Korea.

What, are you gonna write an Ikea like room planner for restaurant owners? And then they gonna spend hours on it? And then they going to keep it updated whenever they change floor plans? Just for what reason, so people can be slightly more picky when picking tables and can reserve a table that can be combined with the next one for a party of 6 for their party of 3? Again, all for basically no payoff for the restaurant owner? Oh and I suppose the restaurant owner is expected to pay for it too? This is the highest voted idea on this site.
The video, taken by a bystander, captured the chaotic scene that unfolded last Friday as officers tried to remove mother Jazmine Headley from the crowded office, where she had sat on the floor for two hours because of a lack of chairs.

I just wasn paying attention to how bad things are. 
Your mom didn't notice her oldest daughter wasn't around for usual domestic services she provided? The neighbors didn't mention the medical care they provided to her unconscious child? I know you want to believe the best of your mom but I find it very unlikely that she didn't know something bad happened to you at her husband's hands. She swept it under the proverbial rug. In any event, I'm glad she eventually found the courage and motivation to leave him.

Back when the EDL was big, it was always a really good thing to me that the antifa/UAF and other opposition was always more than willing and able to come out and protest loud and tackle these bigots head on.

More generally you can tell when men apply double standards to women and don see them as fully human. They insist on walking you home even when you say no, you fine. They subtly boundary push and can take your first no for an answer. You just something that needs to be "convinced."
I don think that San Diego has much of a community outside of some hipster enclaves and the gay folks in hillcrest. San Diego is a fair weather city, and that as close to a cultural identity as they get. Vegas and SD are both tourist towns, but I say Vegas has more of a community on a bad day, even before the Golden Knights got good..
