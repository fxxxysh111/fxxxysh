One must give credit to the veteran diplomat for being articulate. He flatly refused the charge that there was any sell out or any change in policy for demanding a transitional government body in Syria. His contention was that the demand was made in keeping with the communiqu issued by the UN Backed Action Group for Syria in Geneva on June 30, 2012 which called for establishment of a transitional governing body with full executive powers that could include members of the government and opposition, and should be formed on the basis of mutual consent.

You have been in the picture for less than a year, you are lucky she lets you take the kid anywhere by yourself. He two, FFS! You were just pissed that she changed plans on you and decided to start something, trying to bully and shame her into letting you have your way. If you want to be a part of this woman life, you need to listen to what she is saying, respect her relationship with her child, and check yourself when you feel that desire to bulldoze over her to get your way.. 
The real question on this one is, has this dude donked with TP or better? If this was a drawee board or a low board, you might think that he donked to protect his TP type hand and take value of draws, but this is not a drawee board and its not a low board. If he has TP, the only reason he is betting is for value, and would he really bet here for value off an 8 or worse?! I think he be more likely to check and let you bluff. So, I think we can happily say that he doesn usually have TP.

The Lodge   this place is kind of a story of extremes. They never really spread anything higher stakes than $1/2 and their tournaments are low buyin. Some cash tables are awful, boring limp fests with nothing but short stacks and bets over $25 are rare even on later streets. But table 1 will also be running as $1/2, but with $8k on the table and pre flop pots over $100 are very common, if not the average. They also regularly spread a Big O game at $1/2 and sometimes will do a mixed game limit table at $5/10 with overs for $10/20. Some of the dealers are excellent with years of Vegas experience. Some of them are really weak and you should keep an eye out for them flashing cards or mis counting bets/calls. Managers seem to be the same hit and miss. Table stakes at the cash games is a nice change of pace if you have the stake to play deep.

I have chronic pain. I don take opiates as I have an addictive personality. I have 9 years as a recovering alcoholic. There are many ways to deal with this horrible pain. Luckily the Pain Mgmt doctor I saw about 5 years ago had me do a trial with a spinal cord stimulator. I had the surgery and only at times would need some pain meds. Small Fiber Neuropathy, DDD, bursitis, arthritis etc etc. I have found the BEST relief comes from marijuana. It makes my life bearable some days while some other days alls I do is sleep.

Prohibition didn work. People broke the law and a whole industry of crime rose up just because people wanted to drink. Do you think that a lot of women wouldn do the same for a life changing event like a pregnancy? Banning abortion won stop abortion, it only force the women who want one to do it dangerously in an unsafe way. If Republicans actually cared about the life of children, why don they support programs to help children after they born? Why don they support comprehensive sex education in schools and easy access to contraception, things that would dramatically decrease the amount of unwanted pregnancies?

Spiders have four basic modes of gathering information. One type of spider is used only to create the queues of Web pages to be searched by other spiders. This spider, working in "selection" mode, is prioritizing which pages to go through and checking to see if an earlier version of a page has already been downloaded. The second mode is a spider designed especially to go over pages that have already been crawled by a spider. This mode is called "re visitation." Some search engines are concerned that a page has been too thoroughly crawled by other spiders, so they use a spider mode called "politeness," which limits crawling overworked pages. Lastly, "parallelization" allows a spider to coordinate its data collection efforts with other search engine spiders that are crawling over the same page.

Chemical peels have become increasingly popular through the years, with most patients undergoing the procedure to treat the face   particularly the areas around the eyes, forehead and mouth.

The benefit? Smoother skin with fewer wrinkles.

Huckert became captivated with Alice and proposed to her several times. Finally, she gave in saying, "I owed him so much in back wages; I figured it would be cheaper to marry him than pay him off. So I did." Nevertheless, Alice soon found herself widowed once again when Huckert died in 1913. You could say she had no luck at all when it came to husbands.

One night when I was about 18 (drinking age in Australia), I was walking back drunk from the pub, through the suburbs with an equally drunk friend. As we walk past a house with the lights on in the bedroom, a beautiful girl walks in, takes her top off, walks around a bit, then puts her pyjamas on and goes to bed. It was epic for our horny 18yo minds.

Camille's father, like in the show, is barely mentioned in the book. He's just some guy Adora hooked up with when she was 17 and he left before Camille was born.Her sexual assault is also barely in the books and isn't mentioned again after her "first date" with Richard. In the book she never gets an apology, she doesn't have flash backs to it, etc.I feel like Camille talks about having short hair in the book, but doesn't specify when she cut it? I'm not sure about that one. But IIRC she was assaulted after Marian died, but she had short hair when Marian was alive. So she grew her hair out between Marian dying and being assaulted.Nothing is mentioned about dropping out of cheerleading.(Please someone correct me if I got anything wrong)From what I can remember, Amma is arrested, put into a jail/institution until she 18, but it suggested she be locked up beyond that. Camille visits her once and Amma admits she killed the girls because they were taking Adora attention away from her and she couldn deal with it.Camille moves in with Eileen and Curry and relapses with the cutting. She finally goes hard at the small, empty spot on her back that she never carved words into, but Curry bursts in and stops her just as she about to cut her face. The book ends on an "optimistic" tone as she says that she is trying to learn to let herself be loved and taken care of by them.

This is my third book. I had no background in poker and my knowledge came from Rounders. A few years ago I finished The Confidence Game, about con artists. I was trying to think about what I wanted to do next. A lot of things went wrong after that book and I was contemplating the nature of luck. We don't appreciate luck in life when things are going well. No matter how smart I am and how I prepare, there are things that catch you off guard. I really wanted to explore and ask the question about how much we actually control. I don't think a lot of people pose that question to themselves and don't consider how lucky they are. If you send that pitch to editors, they'd laugh. I was reading a lot and trying to figure out how to wrap my mind around luck versus chance.

The toe box, or area around your toes, should be roomy enough for your toes to rest comfortably. Too much room can allow feet to slide inside shoes, causing calluses and other irritation. The more common problem is that the toe box is too tight. If you have wide feet, the toe box is probably your biggest shoe problem. There should also be room in front of the toes, at least 3/8" to 1/2" between your longest toe and the front of the shoe when you are standing. And there should be room above your toes to prevent the shoe from rubbing against them, causing corns. It should provide support but also "give" when your foot moves. Look for an upper made of a material that is nonirritating and porous, allowing air into the shoe. Leather is more likely than vinyl to have these characteristics. (Polish leather shoes frequently to help the uppers stay soft and supple.)The shoe should provide ample cushioning to absorb shock on foot bones and muscles each time you take a step. You need such cushioning in three key areas: the arch; the front, where the ball of the foot rests; and the heel, which normally supports 25 percent of your body weight. The counter   the part of the shoe that curves around the back of your heel   should be stiff enough to prevent ankle strains and sprains. The back of your foot should fit snugly into the heel of the shoe, not slide around inside it.

The rapper then takes a LOT of risk. They are out the money spent on production (and perhaps ghost writing) but they get all the profit that might appear. But most rappers don get any profit.

Recently I read In the Garden of Beasts which is basically the story of the unprepared US Ambassador and his family during the appeasement period.

Then he has a bunch of value like 66, 77, 78s, and the hand he actually had. That around 10 combos already. The only problem would be if Fish has the other 3 combos of JTs and is including that in his value overbetting range. Not sure.

But in less than a second, it all over. You glance forlornly at the captured specimen, now fully removed from the environment in which it was created. It is truly an impressive by product of the respiratory process, still stuck to your finger, its tail hanging below, swinging back and forth like a pendulum. You bring it to eye level to quietly marvel at it. Then, the corners of your mouth begin to curve upward as you realize that yet another sublime pleasure awaits you.

The planet was originally settled by the Prehistoric Life Research Group with the specific intention of recreating ecosystems from Earth past. The atmosphere required some tweaking to reach entirely breathable quality, and this was an opportunity to increase the oxygen levels above those of Earth, to better reflect conditions in prior ecological eras. This planet was chosen specifically because a ready baked, human habitable world was a much more attractive prospect to commercial and national settlement projects, and in the earliest era of offworld settlement even partial terraforming was a somewhat laborious and expensive prospect when compared with the pressing need to find human beings homes..

So I play tug with him, let him get all excited, then I ask for a "give", and, hilariously, I have to wait for him to work himself up to handing it over (he gives the toy tiny little nibbles as he letting go). Then he sits for me, and waits for the "okay!" cue for him to be allowed to play tug again. If he fails any of these steps (doesn give me the toy, tries to grab the toy out of my hand before cued), then we stop playing for awhile. He learned that the reward for that self control (sitting and waiting for the tug toy) is more play, so he motivated to control his excitement.

He's annoying in many respects due to his lack of appreciation for the game. Whenever he bets, almost everybody else will call because he plays so many bad hands. Even if he wins big during the course of a night, he's almost sure to lose that money.

Why Russia and the US are outliers is a great question, and some theorize that it not them, but Christianity that the outlier, since Christianity is the dominant religion in both counties.

I agree. Bobby obsession was an indication of a sexually deviant psychopath in the making. It not much of a stretch to see how someone like that might fantasize about it for years before committing their first kill, which they say feels like an emotional release or a "high" during the crime. Afterwards they experience a gradual build up of tension again, and the cycle repeat itself. The escalation in frequency of killing, or violence committed during it, is similar to the tolerance seen in other physical addictions. Over time the killer needs more and more stimulation to get the same psychological payoff.

Don stay too late, go have some fun with your friends!" in a hybrid joking/scolding tone, and then talk about having a good work life balance.

I told her that I was feeling overwhelmed at 55 hours and she told me that she wouldn care until I hit 65 hours and neither would our big boss. At 65 hours I told her that I was really overwhelmed and her response was, "I tell you when you have too much work to do, you need to figure it out."

Another consideration that needs to come into play when you are looking at a poker table that is shaped like an oval is going to be the idea of how you can fit the chairs into the space.

When 27 year old accountant Christopher Moneymaker became the first World Series of Poker champion to qualify via an online site in 2003 and claim $2.5million he was the right man in the right place at the right time with the right name.

Part of that is helped by the presence of Andrew McKechnie, chief creative officer at 140 and a former creative director at Apple.

Take note of their betting patterns. One of the biggest indicators your opponent is bluffing is how your opponent bets. An opponent who normally raises pre flop to five multiples of the blinds suddenly and makes it 2x the blind instead. This is a major tell that they want you to call. If they make it 10x the blind, they wants you to fold.[5]
It not super compelling television by any means (though I guess it was enthralling enough that I watched four seasons of it), but it not terrible programming either. It has its entertaining moments, for sure, and it preaches some decent morals about friendship and stuff. But anyone that says it has a deeper underlying meaning is misguided. It a Hasbro toy commercial, it a 22 minute long ad that engineered to get people to buy merchandise. That all it ever been; everything else, including the "love and tolerance" mantra, is a fabrication by bronies that saw what they wanted to see.

You should be making enough money playing 1/2 that you can now start cutting back on your work hours and start working part time, but you will not even think about quitting your job until you grinded up a roll for 2/5 and then some. Your final milestone before I would consider you a successful, full time pro will be to have a $15,000 bankroll exclusively for poker and a separate life roll that covers one year of expenses. You can deviate from these numbers but do so with extreme caution.

If a trusted friend or relative has had favorable experiences with a practitioner, many people will feel safe consulting that physician. Referrals are relatively easy to come by in places such as California, where there are thousands of practitioners; most people know somebody who has received acupuncture or herbal therapy. However, in many areas this isn't the case; it is necessary to find a practitioner without the advice of a friend or relative..

Only if you never worked alongside people with mental disabilities. I have, in a few different places. There a massive problem with these agencies not being able to tell who is truly capable of doing a job, and who is not. If someone is so sexually or generally inappropriate that they make fucking everyone uncomfortable by what they say and do, then no, they shouldn have a job. And if they can even follow simple instructions or complete something on their own they shouldn have a job either. When that happens it like when a 6 year old "helps" you do something. It just making your job twice as long because you have to clean up their mistakes too. There was one woman with DS I worked with who did a damn good job when I worked at an animal shelter, and yeah she should have a job because you know, she was capable of it!. I sorry but if you incapable of completing a job (regardless of why) then you shouldn have it. Others are depending on that job getting done.

Correct, the pattern is charted for normal 2 over 2 Xs.

But the detective I talked to asked a lot of questions to corroborate the account, and said in these cases they really try to avoid going to trial, because witness intimidation is a real thing and you're pretty easy to find after testifying about something that happened in/near your home or business.
