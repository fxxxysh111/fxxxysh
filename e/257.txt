How in any way is that not in character for Donald 'win at any cost' Trump? Does anyone think he didn't direct Roger Stone to work with Russia to steal DNC and Hillary campaign e mails?

Those at the bottom who are "remote cousins" are very possibly just false positives and the shared DNA segments are coincidental (in the grand scheme of things the DNA of an Armenian person is not that different from an English person or an Indian person after all).

While NMS is meant to protect small investors trading stocks for themselves, it could hurt them by increasing costs for institutional investors that serve individual investors, such as mutual fund companies, Blume suggests.

On the surface, this equal treatment seems eminently fair, but on closer analysis, it represents a nave view of how trading takes place among different types of investors.

I am a person who cries when upset, but not just upset as in I sad. When I have to quit a job and to to inform the boss   I cry at the boss desk.

Her husband had been supposed to make dinner for her since it was his day off and he hadn so she came home from errands and work and there was no food, so I totally understood her just wanting to go inside.

These past thirty days have been enormously instructive and reinforced my reasons for building a core portfolio around dividend paying equities. The first and most important reason to focus on dividend paying stocks is to capitalize on the enormous effects of compounding. When utilizing DRIP (dividend reinvestment programs), each payout is greater than the one before because each dividend payment is being made on the total number of shares you hold of that particular equity and each month/quarter/year that number of shares grows..

Dont know what its called, but iirc the japanese used to put convicts in concrete holes in the ground. The walls and floor sealed with some form of sealant. You would just spend your days and nights in the hole, being fed and everything. Eventually you would have to pee and crap in the hole you were inhabiting. By the time the first few weeks had passed,the feces would start to rot, along with your feet and skin, because the hole would never be cleaned. They would make sure to take care of your wounds from time to time, just so much that you didnt go septic and die to quickly. I remember reading some people living up to a year like this in agony, until they died from the infections caused by the rotting wounds.

Proponents of liquid supplements use digestion to sell their products. They typically show me literature that says close to 100 percent of their product is absorbed, compared to only 50 percent of the leading brand. What they do not say is that the amount of nutrient in liquid is much less than in a capsule or a tablet. Therefore, if only a fraction of a tablet or capsule is absorbed, the amount of nutrient the patient receives must be equal to or greater than the typical liquid dose. I am not opposed to liquids when marketed correctly.

If you interested in CFP in general, the best thing to do is to put in regular table time and show a proactive attitude towards improvement. CFP programs will usually have a limited number of spots, they will much prefer to take someone who putting in regular volume and actively trying to get better. If they see that you gone from 2NL to 25NL and play X number of hands per week they don have to wonder if you will play enough and study enough to make their effort worthwhile. When browsing offerings/negotiating terms, I definitely advise against putting up 500 EUR in a CFP program. If anything you should get a stake. I also be wary of any program that takes an unlimited number of people and/or doesn vet the people that they take.

Also, I came across this website I unfamiliar with called BirdEye that has almost no reviews between 1 and 5 stars which is kind of suspicious to me, but I digress. A lot of the comments suggest that they specialize in people with bad credit, which could go either way.All this said, I have a really hard time believing that someone can essentially semi retire at 36 to host a bunch of wrestling podcasts (and by all accounts, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars collecting wrestling memorabilia) without doing something greasy.brandroidian   1 points  submitted 1 day agoI don get it.

You do not truly know fear until you hear the snap of a beak less than an inch from your delicate, delicate ears. These guys are such bastards that they typically have a favoured type of human to bully, specialising in either pedestrians or cyclists.

That was unequivocal. If you guarantee drivers that there won be speed enforcement, expect to see speeds increase dramatically.unconvinced that paying officers high salaries to stand on the side of the road intermittently with a radar gun to issue tickets to only a handful of drivers an hour will materially "teach" a city of a million to slow down.also wouldn commit to thresholds or specific criteria other than "we look at what a municipality is doing and ensure that we think it not a cash cow". To limit one very specific type of enforcement as part of a city traffic safety strategy without giving comprehensive guidelines and supports to the rest of the traffic safety strategy strikes me as a huge overreach by the province and an infringement on Albertan city ability to self govern and make the best decisions for themselves.think this is a bad news story, that sounds good and makes for great pre election soundbites.

How the hell does he only have 10k into a home w/ all that additional stuff, and NOT get a deal around the price range I was talking about? LOL, well anyways. He talks some more random gibberish and I thank him and be cordial and everything and hang up, he says he'll call if he finds anything that might help me out for that price range. Which, again, doesn't make sense, I know exactly what he's going to do, he's going to find someone to sell for 1k and try to flip it to me for 4k. Again, not making any sense because if there were no 4k deals, he wouldn't have told me he'd help me find a deal. He also says he has his own crew of contractors to do work on the homes.

My family used to go camping a lot when I was a kid; on one such trip I was fucking around in high brush by myself a couple hours before we left. Wasn't until about an hour into the ride home that I started getting a deep, horrible itch on the back of my neck. We pulled over and my mom looked and what do you know, a fucking tick had latched on. Wasn't much we could do then, we were only about 20 minutes away from home at that point so we got there quick and then my mom pried it out with tweezers. Not the best way but it worked fine then. I'll never forget that, most disgusting thing to ever happen to me.

Alongside the other two components of the autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body's internal organs. Stress as in the flight or fight response is thought to counteract the parasympathetic system, which generally works to promote maintenance of the body at rest.

Add half a yellow onion, finely diced, to the bottom, after it has time to cook and start to turn translucent, add some minced garlic and just flash fry for 30 seconds to a minute. Don let it burn. Now add your rice. Stir it around a little to get the rice coated in oil, then let it sit. Don touch, let it sit until it has just turned golden brown on the bottom, then start stirring, getting color across as much of the rice as possible.

11 11 12 is a gloomy day for mankind, because it is a turning point to a next phase in human history. The gloominess does not only results in physical death, but also a spiritual death. Look at the spiritual death scale today; it is growing at a very high pace. People translate evil as goodness and darkness as a light. Jesus is beginning to overthrow the tables of money changers again. At this phase of human history, we will witness the fulfillment of woes mentioned in Isaiah chapter 5. Surely, my heart desires a peace on earth in GOD's will with perfection and purity among all people. Unfortunately, GOD knows the evil of man's heart will not repent and turn away from sins of their hands. We can witness that the lust and greed of the things of the world had never been woven as deep in human history as we see today. All are sold out to the idols of the greed of gold, wealth and worldly ambitions. People are worshipping their idols at the high places as never before. The judgments mentioned in Isaiah 5 are ready to come to pass. 11 11 12 is a beginning of a phase for an upheaval of nature, as well as a revival of the Church of Christ. Please read the tab ?Most Recent Prophecies?. It will help you understand the significance of this prophecy. Pharisees denied JESUS because HE did not come according to their expectation. GOD fulfills HIS prophecies not according to what we evaluate, but according to HIS ways. HIS ways are not our ways and HIS thoughts are not our thoughts. This prophecy came to pass.

Edmond Dantes, consumes wholly by vengeance, plans to bring down his betrayers.

The initial plan of casino developer Dan Gilbert was to build a casino atop a parking garage overlooking the Cuyahoga River behind the Terminal Tower. The complications and likely slowness of building on a riverbank moved the casino to what came to be called I in the Higbee Building. Phase II would come later. That was before racinos were legalized, however, and certainly didn't take into account a planned, full service casino in New Castle, Pa., near the Ohio border. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has a license for a casino there, but has yet to approve a development plan. While Gilbert has continued to say the new casino, which could offer the kind of amenities now available at the racinos, is in the offing, no timetable is being offered. Last week, Mortland would only say that nothing has changed in those plans. But Meczka isn't so sure. don't think they can generate enough revenue to justify a new facility, he said. an unnecessary investment.

Speedy strip poker games can start like a regular poker game, but everyone (except the winner of course) removes an item of clothing. This is a very fast way and very good excuse for stripping naked, not to mention this will give you great motivation in playing poker. Medium mode stripping in a strip poker game means that the winner is the only person who is not stripping, but the losers have the option to buy back clothes in the coming rounds.

Last but not least, this room, so far as I could tell, didn have many Old Man Coffee (OMC) players. My guess for this is because the area is not mature. There are OMC in Vegas, St. Louis, Tunica, throughout Florida, and many other places because those rooms have been there FOREVER. These OMC were once young and just got old there. In DC, it appears as if the community is all new, so there has not been time for OMC to take root. I thought the games were actually easier in the morning and day compared to night. It not like the night games were hard per se, but the young regulars seemed to set up and more of the totally clueless players had left by then. I have not ever been to a room like that. It always the opposite   nittier games riddled with rock garden OMC and then the games loosen up with more players at night.

Catan belongs to a sub group of board games often referred to as German style board games, because many of them come from there. They are often more about social interaction or building things than just moving pieces around a board, as well as being about scoring rather than eliminating other players.

So in my case cohabiting prior to marriage worked just fine BUT here the difference: engagement and marriage timeline was on the table already, we also joined up our finances(which was honestly the biggest commitment to the relationship we could possibly have done), and it was simply far more frugal to share joint expenses. We were engaged 2 years later just like previously agreed upon, and married about a year later(I didn want to be stressed with a short engagement for planning purposes) but my husband and I have treated our relationship functionally as a marriage since committing to financial solidarity.

Consider checking when good cards hit you, if checking is available, either on the flop or on the turn to act casually (checking is not available when someone has a bet that you must call/raise or fold/abandon the pot).

Be seen holding good cards at showdown, win or lose, or occasionally turnover your good cards when people suggest they think that you win by bluffing.

Not from documentaries, or books, or reputable websites. Just shit in their head they heard somewhere and always believed. There also a lot of old wives tales they teach. The taste map of the tongue thing, the idea that carrots are good for the eyes specifically, etc. For anyone wondering that carrot thing was made up during WW2 by the British so they could simultaneously get people to eat all of the excess carrot rations, as well as make up a reason that the British were so good at shooting down planes. They didn want to give up the fact that they were the first to use radar to find enemy planes.

Yes, TERF, homophobic, and transphobic are shaming. Because it bad to be homophobic, transphobic, or a terf. Duh.

It a descriptor for trends and bigger picture things, just addressing the erasure and othering of people who aren straight. It asking for the world to acknowledge that gay people exist. Seems pretty gentle to me.
