The history of the 20th century should have taught us that it is important to shape circumstances before crises emerge, and to meet threats before they become dire. The history of the past century should have taught us to embrace the cause of American leadership.

I was giving them to customers who were purchasing comics in the days and weeks afterwards, until I had a military mom come through my line. I gave her two, and she mentioned that her one son squadron may like them.

You definitely should poke into the soranet era. That was where legitimate and controversial stuff was mass hoarded. To me it was quite silly in trying to stop it (since it will happen again; it had been shut down a few times before) and it was by luck that they got shut down. They had a point system where if you post stuff you can gain more access the site and its features. You could of course pay to do that quicker but it was free. You will see remnants of it on tumblr. I say the biggest problem was the doxxing, stalking, and underage material (not children, but still underage). The mods did their best to prevent that stuff. I have a feeling there are underground sites that still do this, which Ilbe users may be aware of.

One thing I am super grateful for at my med school is that at least as med students we are relatively VERY well protected.

The Strata Property Act establishes the change must be significant and applies to use or appearance, but how does a council determine what is significant?A straightforward test on the proposed change is helpful. Will the change in use alter the ability of owners, tenants or guests to access the facility? Is the change short term only to address a maintenance or safety issue or is this a policy change in use? How will everyone be affected by the change? Will the change result in other occupants being affected adversely?If you are planning a change in use or appearance, there may be other considerations. A removal of a tree or group of plantings may affect the appearance, as well as the use of the property, and may affect privacy.

V3 on button is a casual player, usually passive. He almost always donk bets from OOP if he connects with the board, and he will call you down often with middle pairs across multiple streets even with overs on the board. He flats the $28 which is a problem because I think he plays his entire range as a call (including AA JJ), but his range is extremely wide including every pair and suited Ax, and maybe even every off suit Ax as well.. 
That literally what the comment chain I was posting in was about when I got banned. I wasn trying to "further a narrative", I was simply pointing out that people have done bad things while pretending to believe in the ideology. 
If they copy just like Apex that's kinda disappointing to me tbh, why try to be like them when people enjoy your game, but whatever maybe I'm in the minority.

The point of Ezra's lyrics and songs are never about the references he makes. Look at Step for example   his references are a callback to who he was during his college years, a pretentious and immature kid. The chorus counters both verses by shedding these pretenses and stating he's ready to settle down and grow up. The most important lyrics of any Vampire Weekend song sheds these pretenses and cuts to the point   it's most evident on the back half of Contra and all of MVOTC. In Diplomat's Son, the central lyrics are the line that Rostam sings   "I know you'll say I'm not doing it right, but this is how I want it/I can't go back to how I felt before". No references, just Rostam coming to terms with his sexuality. The song wouldn't exist without this realization. Look at Step again. The bridge cuts to the realization Ezra's character is making, "Wisdom's a gift but you'd trade it for you/Age is an honor, it's still not the truth". Simple and to the point. These lyrics are necessary to the core meaning of the song.

As it turns out villain has 98 and not a flush anyway because he has no idea what he doing, but even then it not the short term results that matter but the reasoning behind your actions.Turn sucks, river even worse, and you still 3barreled your whole stack in never considering you could be beat, with the last barrel being double pot. That verrrrry spewy.Is it because I am in first position that a lead out is bad on the flop?? Say if im in last position and everybody checks then would a lead out be bad. Because I dont think i should be giving flush draws a free card.I understand now that the jam on the river is a huge mistake as good players wont fold their flush draws there.The guy was counting the cards on the board, im sure he had some sort of straight so that takes out all flush possibilities, with that information how would you play the river when a club comes out?Yeah he could be counting as a false tell but hes a fish and so am i apparently.I play my tournaments at all pubs across Melbourne Australia this was one of them where the buy in was $50 feild is decent.

I had a customer a few years ago that decided to build his own house using credit cards to pay everybody to get points and miles. Then get a mortgage to pay off the cards and he'd be home free. Problem was that as he was finishing his house was when the sub prime crash hit. He had a hell of a time getting a loan. He finally did through some small bank that carried it in house. It all worked out, but he was pooping bricks there for a while looking at the credit card interest he was about to pay. I know you're busy man but a few bullet points would be super helpful. Worth asking!

Why would we continue with Q2 and K2 and fold out the rest when in reality Q2 is the same hand as 24 if his only value hands are A2 and pocket tens? Also, after Eastgate folds, Greenstein should know Eastgate folded a deuce and he has AA so he blocks A2 suited. Now, there is still only 1 combo of A2 suited and 3 combos of TT. Isn AA the same as K2 given your analysis? If we are Greenstein and the board is different where we block all of the A2 suited hands, would we then call?.

I looked into this, and I do believe that our efforts to handle this were not sufficient.

Treating your cat's case of ear mites is a three step process. The first step is to get as many tiny critters out of the ear canal as possible by cleaning the ear. You can use an ear cleaning solution (available at pet supply stores) or try almond or olive oil, but clear the latter with your vet first. Put several drops of the solution or oil into the ear canal and massage gently. Massaging will help bring debris up to the outer part of the ear where it can be wiped away with a cotton ball or tissue. Do not use cotton swabs, because one slip could puncture an eardrum. Repeat the cleaning procedure until the debris is gone.

R4: (at 3:29) The creator of this video makes the bold claim that second person pronoun "you" derives from a misspelling by german printing presses of the word "thou/ou" because they did not have the appropriate letter for thorn and had substituted it with "y", hence "ou > you" which "was kept [.] in pronunciation for some reason" (their words). They make reference for "ye" in "ye olde" as an example of this and while this indeed the case for the definite article in "Ye Olde", this is only true for speakers of Modern English due to its anachronistic use in culture and language. This is not the case for "you", which in fact, is the oblique form of the archaic nominative, plural, second person pronoun "ye" and, as with many European languages of the time, plural personal pronouns were considered more polite and formal, while "thou" the singular pronoun, was considered informal and familiar.

In Chop Suey Nation, Hui puts a unique spin on the subject as she explores her own perceptions of Chinese Canadian (or chop suey) cuisine, its historical and cultural significance, and the stories of families carrying on the tradition in small towns from coast to coast. "I definitely had in my mind, or maybe it was ingrained in me, this idea that chop suey Chinese food was lesser than the 'authentic' stuff; that it was 'fake,' that it was somehow less valid or legitimate than food that actually had its origins in China," says Hui. While Zimmern and others have disparaged it, Hui hopes her work will help others to learn to appreciate it as she has. "This tendency to dismiss this food, to denigrate it has become so common," she adds. Created by early Cantonese immigrants using readily available ingredients   such as cabbage, carrots or celery, but always bean sprouts ("as long as you have water and a bucket, you can grow bean sprouts")   it tells an inspiring story of hardship, persistence and survival.

I was fortunate enough to finally see a restored version on TCM back in October. The literal freak show aspect aside, it's a very entertaining thriller/horror film that has more heart than it should.

According to a Democratic Peace Party spokesman, China is about to bring online next year, 113 more coal plants and 227 trash incinerating plants in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, on the Chinese eastern coastline across South Korea which could practically double the problem of air pollution for South Korea next year. We don have to accuse China of anything to cause a fight. Why can the government approach China in a friendly manner and at least talk to them about these new facilities that are about to come online, which will practically kill us all? At least talk to them and show our concern, and offer to help or even offer to pay for better pollution controls for these plants if they refuse to stop the building of these plants..

I really like to know how much you asking for, to add new faculty.

Remember that she is a victim in this and while it understandable to be frustrated and upset with her, you have to let that pass and support her. Ensure that she doesn make the same mistake again.
