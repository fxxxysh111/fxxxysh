I used to work at a fancy coffee shop, and I will say a real espresso with some lemon will truly bring out the flavor of coffee. But it is very bitter, and stupid hot. And just prefer drip. Though I have owned a moka, and a french press, I liked the versatility of a french press, i could make tea in it also, the moka was pretty cool, i liked using cafe bustello with mine and made cuban espresso. I have never felt pour over was anything special, it just drip coffee that needs a servant. And pulling my own espresso shots was fun because it was ritualistic, and the quality of your pull was only 22 seconds from being known and you could watch the creama form.

A continuation of the previous course where we look at how to improve application performance while focusing on maintainability. Students introduce application monitoring to the system and see how to AutoScale based on performance metrics. Application deployment strategies are discussed and we see how to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to quickly deploy and update application code. Then students focus on performance by introducing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and application cache to the solution. In each module, students learn about the core AWS technologies and best practices for each.

It could be three phase, many swap and shops are full of three phase motors junked from closed plants and manufacturers and the seller has no idea what the motor is or came from, however, five wires as the question states, indicates the five wires come from the windings and none are chassis ground, leaving only four motor wires, in single phase, three wires could be a common, to one lead for one direction, and to another for the opposite direction and the remaining two wires could be external thermal leads, it could be multiple speed as noted above, in a single phase variety, The problem with electric motors where the nameplate or connection plate is missing is problematic, as there are thousands of variations of motors, built for specific applications, if the question is what NEMA design 5 lead motor connections are, that could drill down the possible answers, But back to single phase for a moment: Single Phase Terminal Markings Identified By Color: (NEMA Standards) 1 Blue 5 Black P1 No color assigned 2 White 6 No color assigned P2 Brown 3 Orange 7 No color assigned 4 Yellow 8 Red Most three phase NEMA motors are three, six, nine or twelve leads, rarely are the ends of each phase brought out, plus the neutral [internal wye connection only] and then a chassis ground, making a total of five. Internally delta connected motors would not have a single neutral point, so those three phase motors that are connected delta internally are often just three, or if the need existed for a wye delta external connection, then both ends of each phase would be brought out, the motor then would be connected externally with three wires in a bundle [electrically connected and isolated] using the last three to the incoming power, or if externally connected delta the delta points would be made up by taking the end of one phase to the beginning of the next, the end of the last to the beginning of the first.

That is NOT how "expropriat[ing] the means of production and put[ting]in the hands of the worker class" work. Firstly because taxes take money (which are not ordinarily considered a means of production) from everyone, not just the bourgeoisie. Secondly, workers being in control is supposed to mean that the workers of that company themselves would collectively be directly in charge, not the government or politicians (kinda like a "cooperativa").

As rumors grew of Russian interference, I grew more and more paranoid. The paranoia, suspicion, and desire for radical action I felt towards the changes in government were mirrored in how I felt towards my employers and changes they were trying to make in my job.

All the while I felt safe in doing so, as I held an important role and was being trained for another position in the company.

In the last 24 hours I come across two antiquarian outlooks on the longevity of the world coal supply after not having seen hardly anything of the sort written in the 19th century. (The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy". Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know. 
In the event of a downturn in business due to a conviction, SNC does have at least one significant asset it could sell to combat a cash crunch. SNC stake in the 407 toll road that skirts Toronto to the north has been rumoured to be on the block before, as recently as August when the company itself suggested it might sell part of its holding in a bid to unlock shareholder value. While there would be no shortage of bidders, some question whether there is enough of an incentive to sell without a larger, more encompassing solution to the company problems. SNC 16 per cent stake in the 407 could be worth billions, and is often used by analysts to set a floor on the company stock price. Claude Lamoureux, former head of the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board, notes that the 407 provides a steady income stream that offsets lumpier revenue from other operations. Spinning it off would be easy, Lamoureux said, at the same time, it weakens SNC. Bastien, the Raymond James analyst, said a sale of the 407 on its own would not be enough to change his view on SNC stock. not a fan of companies selling their best business to shore up struggling ones, he said. In a recent note to clients, he said SNC dividend cut to us a partial sale of Highway 407 may not be imminent after all. Maintain the status quo

Yea, the cause and time of day of accidents aren statistically very much different from any other State either.

Wells who famously wrote about it in 1914 (in The World Set Free), which came a few years after a very obscure mention by the semi polymath Gustave Le Bon who wrote about its scientific possibility in 1905 in the Revue Scientifique. That said I was surprised to see the atomic bomb referenced in a comic in 1940 (book five years before the Trinity test): "The Atomic Bomb, Lucky Bird, Flier of G2"1 definitely suggests a bomb of high power, which so far as I can determine from my non existent comic book expertise seems to be the earliest of its kind.

Even if I just keep the money in the bank, a bank will then lend that money out to a small business for example who can then expand.

3. Produce not just incremental gains but exponential gains by recognizing how your business really makes money. For example, Costco studied its numbers and realized it made more money from selling memberships than from selling goods in its stores! So it tailors its advertising and marketing to bring people back into the stores to buy things on a regular basisso they will continue to keep their memberships in good standing. And "The Biggest Loser" TV show promotes The Biggest Loser Club, where an individual pays a yearly membership fee to lose weight in the online Biggest Loser Club. More than a million people choose to do so each quarter. Now that's real leverage!

If the use of the method is acceptable, a decision can be made. In the above example, the experiments showed that of the things available for testing not a single one failed to fall when not supported by anything, so the hypothesis is published as the 'Theory of Unsupported Falling', including a record of predictions and experiments.

Most poker players used to spend a lot of time away from their families, around poker tables in casinos playing. This should not be a problem as you can play from top online poker sites without leaving the safety of your house. This is the surest way to reduce domestic conflicts with those who demand attention.

You can then join them after the breaks and enjoy the much demanded time
Moreover, small stakes gives you an opportunity to horn your skills before venturing in a bigger bet.

An investigation ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki into Blackwater's September 16 shooting in Baghdad, in which 17 civilians were killed and another 24 were wounded, has determined that the company's operators opened fired indiscriminately and without provocation. government pay $8 million in compensation to each of the victims' families and sever all Iraq based contracts with Blackwater within the next 6 months. government will comply and perhaps even more unclear if it could meet the Iraqi government's demands even if it wanted to. Civilian employees of the State Department rely on Blackwater for protection. diplomatic operations would be paralyzed, at least until another private contractor could be hired for the job. Even if this were to happen, it's doubtful that booting Blackwater would make much difference. More than likely, its operators would quickly find work with competitors like Triple Canopy and DynCorp, who would have to fill the Baghdad security void in Blackwater's absence. The private security sector is a small one after all. Even Andrew Moonen, the Blackwater operator who got drunk in the Green Zone last Christmas Eve and murdered one of the Iraqi vice president's security guards, found a new job with Combat Support Services Associates, which put him back to work in Kuwait just two months after the shooting.

It's a good bonding experience   a good way for you and your baby to get to know each other and spend a bit of quality time together Studies have suggested that physical contact is good for babies, improving breathing, circulation, digestion and growth. It provides a good source of sensory and muscle stimulation, which is beneficial for all babies, but may be particularly good for babies with special needs, such as developmental disabilities and Down's Syndrome. Baby massage is even claimed to combat postnatal depression in mothers 1 It relaxes both parent and child It's fun for both of you. Some health professionals feel that you should not carry out massage on newborn babies, or should wait until they have had their first full course of immunisations (3 4 months). Conversely, others feel you should start as soon as possible as massage can help to provide a transition between the womb and the outside world, and that massage is particularly beneficial for premature babies. Massage is also a popular option for coping with colic, a problem only normally encountered by babies under 3 4 months. If you have any concerns about massaging your baby   and especially if your baby is sick   you should consult an appropriate health professional first. In any case: never massage a baby if the baby seems uncomfortable.

If you c bet larger OTF, it makes giving up on the turn more expensive. If anything, you should c bet smaller if you give up on the turn/river when c betting at a higher frequency (online strategies have a lot of 1/4 1/3rd pot range bets on the flop, depending on texture).2) If the board is wet and you are the PFR, you should generally be checking more often OR c betting a larger size at a lower frequency (generally).3) Should you c bet all flops when the PFR 3 better  at 1/2NL games, this is probably fine. You only flop a pair 1/3rd (ish) of the time, so it going to be hard to continue just when you hit.4) C bet more when OOP  depends on the stakes; at lower stakes it probably doesn matter much.You need to start thinking a bit more thoroughly about the game, though.

Amma obviously didn't kill her friends back in Wind Gap   or accomplices as we now know   and it leaves open the question about the racially charged atmosphere both in Wind Gap and in the Preaker household, where their maid was forced to wear that truly absurd and dated maid's outfit. Amma killed the girls who were labeled different and outcasts; but could this also mean that she considered them her friends because they were white? I think it's worth adding, too, that Amma, being the deceptive psychopath she so obviously is, chose to befriend an African American girl when she moved with Camille to St. Louis as a way to "keep up appearances", as we've heard people say so much throughout this series, before dispatching with her in the ways that she does.

Yes  it is. What does keeping the fasts of the Church mean? Did you have a glass of wine on Friday  which could count as Saturday if it is towards the evening? Did you drink a lot of beer throughout the week because it isn wine and is allowed and is liquid bread anyway? Did your hummus that you ate on Thursday have oil in it? Did you use half and half in your coffee instead of soy milk on Tuesday? Did all of the fake meat products make it feel like you weren fasting at all? What does it mean to break a fast?.

Honestly, I love the fact that there so much stuff on bandcamp. For me, finding new music on there is like a treasure hunt, and a lot of the fun of it is combing through all of it and it makes finding the hidden gems even more rewarding. Plus it exposes me to a lot of stuff I wouldn normally listen to when all I have to go off of is the cover art and a couple of tags. If someone else were out there "finding the hidden masterpieces" for me, it wouldn be as much fun. Plus, I don think it possible anyways, it too subjective. Like they say: one man trash is another man treasure.

The gym can be a very intimidating place. You will see impossibly big muscular dudes that get all red in the face and scream at the top of their lungs while picking up a bar with as much weights as can fit on it. You will see insanely attractive women with perfectly flat stomachs and huge boobs working out in designer yoga pants and sports bras that hide nothing, taking up half an acre of space with their mats, dumbells, stretchy bands, weird half yoga balls, ipads, and shaker bottles full of mysterious viscous green fluids. You will get on the treadmill next to an old skinny 80 year old dude who will be running faster than you for twice as long as you, and will walk around the changeroom afterwards very naked.

People seek beauty. They are constantly trying to improve what they have or whatever they give themselves a different new look.

It becoming a better sci fi show, but it not even close to trek yet. It still relies on fake drama, and life or death stakes every episode. Shots of two people talking are filmed with Micheal bay esque rotation shots and swelling frenetic music. And it preaches with voiceover instead of showing the themes of the episodes. There was a scene a few episodes ago where they are just jogging through the ship and there are flashing lights everywhere (literally all the lights were turning on and off completely).

If I understand your question, you are referring to a hierarchical language structure in which there are different levels of formality depending on things like social status, friendship, familial relationship, rank et al. If so, here is a nice quick and dirty breakdown of the seven levels of speech in Korean. It gives a small example of when they are used, so this should be a good starting point for you. There are better resources, but many of them provide examples written only in Hangul. In reality, only three of them are used in everyday speech: formal, polite, and informal, which is further explained in this article. I do not know how useful this would be to you since Korean is an agglutinating language, but it should still give you some things to consider when incorporating something like this in your language.

Similarly, if you drinking at a bar but at a table rather than at the bar itself, bring your empty glasses to the bar when you go to refill!! So much easier for the bartenders, not to mention in a packed bar if everyone did this, it would make things hella quicker by not having the dilemma of no glasses and/or a busy bartender running around the eating space to grab glasses to clean. ALSO   as a slightly above 5 tall woman, empty glasses in front of me at the bar makes me more noticeable than I would normally be that I need another drink. Also ALSO   it gives you a chance/excuse to sneak in where people are sipping on full drinks AT the bar to get to the front. Lastly, if I were the bartender I would truly appreciate this (just good karma) and thereby might at least consider giving you priority.

And contrary to popular myth, some cats do need regular grooming. Some cats are naturally super greasy and grease leads to matting and other skin issues like stud tail, cat acne or pyoderma. From my experience it seems to be especially common in Persians and British Shorthairs (both have very dense coats that don't allow for the skin to breathe well). We also bathe and blow dry a lot of long haired cats as it's hands down the most effective way to get out (sometimes years worth of) heavy undercoat, which again can cause matting and doesn't always easily comb out (or the cat doesn't tolerate combing well). A HV dryer is invaluable for blasting out clean, slippery hair that has been loosened in the bath and cats learn to tolerate it incredibly well.

Because what people do is get into the station on a $2.50 ticket, then they make an $8 trip (or whatever their fare would be), then leave through the emergency exit. They can go through the normal exit gate because it wouldn open for them due to the fare discrepancy. By this method, they can ride BART while technically having a ticket but evade most of the fare..

It does not pass easily through the cell membrane as it is changed. It also requires two enzyme steps to 'release' its fatty acids.

The first way to kill a Sim in Sims 2 is to build a pool, and after the Sim gets in, take all ladders out. Another way to kill a pregnant female Sim is to wait until their hunger is really low, it won't necessarily be rock bottom (because they are pregnant and their needs decay quicker and die quicker), but then they will drop to the floor and the grim reaper will come and take care of the rest. WARNING: If you kill a Sim, all of the Sim's relationships will receive a negative memory of that Sim dying.

Q: My 12 year old son has a newspaper route but he seldom glances into the papers he delivers. This week however, he hesitantly announced that he dropped a bundle of papers and the first flyer that fell out was a back to school flyer! He was all excited to share his wish list with me, but the panic I felt must have shown on my face; he's a bit too young to really understand how stressful added expenses can be. I'm a single mom with 2 kids and even though they'll both be in high school this year, this back to school time always seems to be a big expense.

Oh, it the Africans producing intersexed bodies, not ""civilized" countries like Australia or America? Such a ridiculous claim can only be made because of the Victorian racial science that produced both Empire and Sports. According to the Victorian scientists, highly influenced by Darwinian theory, the most advanced cultures were those with the most extreme sex differentiation. Who was more sex differentiated than the Victorian middle class? The "ladies" stayed home and fainted; the men shot lions in Africa and were aggressive in the market. Ah, but sadly, as industrialization swept all the men into desk jobs, a genuine fear arose that the men were being feminized by modern culture. A movement developed to introduce sports into schools to butch up the bourgeois boys. This movement, known as Muscular Christianity, was a favorite of Teddy Roosevelt and was what brought the YMCA to every town in America.

Yep. My mom coworker had to go on a last minute 3 month long TDY while her husband was deployed overseas. My mom offered to let her 7YO son stay with us rather than him going to a foster home (their extended family wouldn take him in, for whatever reason). The kid was in the same class as my older sister and we attended the same church, so our families knew each other reasonably well. But while I barely remember it, it made a lasting negative impression on him. I bumped into him 20 years later and he said the experience had been traumatic. Not because my family had treated him poorly, but because he felt like he been abandoned by his entire family. It was bad enough that his dad was deployed and then his mom had to leave, but then realizing that none of his extended family loved him enough to take care of him for 3 months? That was heartbreaking for him to realize as a little kid.

The transformation of the global economy requires more than the basic exchange of goods of equal value. According to Max Weber 1903 class, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, it was the belief of certain Protestant sects, particularly Calvinist ones, that economic wealth was a sign of God favor (Predestination) that allowed capitalism to flourish on American and English soil. In other words, while Catholics were still mired in the idea that greed is bad, that it is more difficult for a rich man to get into heaven than a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, the Protestants were beginning to make a religion out of profit..

Spiders have four basic modes of gathering information. One type of spider is used only to create the queues of Web pages to be searched by other spiders. This spider, working in "selection" mode, is prioritizing which pages to go through and checking to see if an earlier version of a page has already been downloaded. The second mode is a spider designed especially to go over pages that have already been crawled by a spider. This mode is called "re visitation." Some search engines are concerned that a page has been too thoroughly crawled by other spiders, so they use a spider mode called "politeness," which limits crawling overworked pages. Lastly, "parallelization" allows a spider to coordinate its data collection efforts with other search engine spiders that are crawling over the same page.

That's not to take anything away from Jessica Chastain, who inhabits the role of poker impresario Molly Bloom with such panache and vivaciousness that she may well take home a best actress Oscar. Whatever plaudits she receives, though, will be due to Sorkin's cunning screenplay."Molly's Game" is Sorkin's directorial debut, and captures the same staccato patter of Sorkin's trademark TV series "Sports Night," "The West Wing" and "The Newsroom," as well as the awards darling films he penned, "The Social Network," "Moneyball" and "Steve Jobs."Bloom narrates the bewildering tale after the fact, explaining how she was was a genius and elite athlete turned chronic underachiever in her early 20s.

As to your scenario, I don think it that crazy. First I don think Teresa was stabbed in the bedroom  that only comes from Brendan. But it makes sense to rape Teresa in the trailer  she came up to the trailer after photographing the van to get payment. Easy to grab her and pull her inside, and do whatever he wanted to do. He would take her to the garage to shoot her to avoid leaving blood spatter all over his trailer  it obviously much easier to clean liquid off a cement floor than off carpet. And he took her 10 yards to the burn pit because. what else was he going to do? Burn his garage down? It doesn seem like a crazy sequence of events  pull her inside when she comes to the door, rape her, bring her out to the garage to shoot her (personally i think she was already choked to death by then and the shooting was releasing rage but that just personal theory), burn her in the pit right behind the garage.

Suddenly, it buzzes with the enthusiasm of cinephiles, filmmakers, actors and artists from all over. This year's highlights include the opening night film, "Farewell My Queen," directed by Benoit Jacquot; the new thriller "Twixt" by old timer Francis Ford Coppola; a Castro Theatre presentation of Buster Keaton shorts accompanied by the live music of tUnE yArDs. Amid the headliners, the fest offers smaller narrative films and documentaries and a few experiments that integrate both (such as provocateur Harmony Korine's "The Fourth Dimension").
