During the recruitment process, my role is to ensure that what happens is legal (for instance, you would be surprised how many managers ask questions that are straight up unlawful) and on the "soft skills" side, I a better judge of character than a lot of hiring managers are.

When you are shopping for Texas Hold Em Poker Chips, you should always give some thought to how you will use them.

The first clue is the shoulders   are the shoulders hanging naturally in a relaxed pose, or are they tight and raised?

When watching TV programs, or movies, you'll come across scenes wherein people are playing poker, more often than not, Texas hold   em. The said game looks absolutely cool, and, if you have no experience playing it, you may think that following the strategies you observed from the program or the movie will make you win at Holdem. The truth, however, is that most strategies shown in movies may not really be real.

Make a data breach response plan. Figure out what your organization will do when a security breach happens. Make sure to include compliance along with the criteria you will use to determine the level of harm. Explains McPhail: the heat of the moment, you will feel a need to minimize the harm to your business, but what you should keep in mind is that it not just the number of people that makes the breach harmful, but what information is involved. solid plan in place that focuses on compliance will help you know exactly what do in a crisis. Also, remember that you must keep records of all breaches, even if they do not reach the reporting threshold. You may want to show the plan to the Privacy Commissioner office or a privacy professional. They are there to help you. And by showing them your plan and getting the blessing of the Privacy Commissioner, you will ensure you have the right measures in place when a crisis hits.

We study a very small three player poker game (one third street Kuhn poker), and a simplified version of the game that is interesting because it has three distinct equilibrium solutions. For one third street Kuhn poker, we are able to find all of the equilibrium solutions analytically. For large enough pot size, P, there is a degree of freedom in the solution that allows one player to transfer profit between the other two players without changing their own profit. This has potentially interesting consequences in repeated play of the game. We also show that in a simplified version of the game with P>5, there is one equilibrium solution if 5P . This may be the simplest non trivial multiplayer poker game with more than one distinct equilibrium solution and provides us with a test case for theories of dynamic strategy adjustment over multiple realisations of the game.We then study a third order system of ordinary differential equations that models the dynamics of three players who try to maximise their expectation by continuously varying their betting frequencies. We find that the dynamics of this system are oscillatory, with two distinct types of solution. We then study a difference equation model, based on repeated play of the game, in which each player continually updates their estimates of the other players' betting frequencies. We find that the dynamics are noisy, but basically oscillatory for short enough estimation periods and slow enough frequency adjustments, but that the dynamics can be very different for other parameter values.

But more importantly, there's also the question of how much we should worry about the people there being extremists (extremely religious, nationalist etc). Rome wasn't built in one day. Syria been at the center of a global clusterfuck for a while now, the population has had no education in almost a decade, and has experienced terror on a daily basis. It took the Europeans over a millennium to go from barbarians that let slaves fight each other to death as national sport to the ideas of Thomas More and Erasmus. I grew up in the Netherlands and it is well known here that the Netherlands went into a religious setback after the Second World War. Gays were still thrown in mental hospitals in the Netherlands in the 1970's, and now the same country has the image of being one of the leading countries in terms of LGBT rights. How fair is it that we expect any part of Syria to go from a global clusterfuck to a society ruled with the intellectual ideas of the Renaissance by 8pm tomorrow?

The term deep linking was first used in the context of search engine optimization (SEO) to describe the practice of linking to a website's internal pages rather than to its homepage. As an SEO strategy, deep linking allows site users to more easily find the specific content they're looking for while simultaneously improving a website's relevancy in search engine results by connecting keyword rich hyperlinks on one interior site page to keyword rich content on another internal page [source: Patel].

Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in depth or highly plot reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.

First player bets $100. The next player goes all in with $45. A player then calls with the full $100. Another player goes all in with $50. Always start the Main Pot first with the shortest chips. Say out loud "John has $45 four ways, plus the blinds. That will be $180 plus the $10 Blind. Mary has $5 more, 3 ways, that makes $15 in the first side pot. All the rest is in Side Pot 2." You now have 3 pots. Any more betting goes into pot 3. You must say your calculations out loud. If anyone disagrees this is their time to speak up. Take corrections graciously.

Not very glamorous, is it? Not something someone with a gambling problem would want to do. A person with a gambling problem needs the rush and excitement of REAL money, not the embarrassing, meaningless money of literally playing for pennies. There no rush getting it all in for $2. However, someone who REALLY wants to succeed in poker and has the patience to pay their dues and learn the game WOULD do exactly that. Myself and many others have done EXACTLY that. I started with a $100 bankroll LITERALLY playing for pennies with ONE table online. I stuck to my rules though and slowly moved up adding tables VERY gradually.

They then contacted the participants again 14 months later, asking whether they had abstained from smoking and other tobacco use for at least the previous month.They found that the cigarette smokers who ate fruits and vegetables an average of 4 or more times per day were 3 times more likely to be abstinent from all tobacco products, including cigarettes, 14 months later, compared with those who ate fruits and vegetables fewer than 2 times per day (PThis held true even after controlling for age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, household income, and behavioral indicators of general health orientation.Those who ate more fruits and vegetables also exhibited fewer measures of dependence.They were less likely to smoke 20 or more cigarettes per day (Pwho eat more fruits and vegetables may be more health conscious to begin with and therefore be more amenable to smoking cessation, Haibach said.surveys indicate that people who smoke cigarettes are more likely to binge drink, use illicit drugs, and exercise less, and we controlled for this using exercise, heavy drinking, and street drug use as markers of general health orientation, he added.However, residual confounding may still exist, and the researchers recommend further research, including studies that incorporate all dietary factors and experimental studies.For now, doctors should continue to ask all of their patients about tobacco use.their patients who use tobacco, they should ask about tobacco use at each visit, advise of consequences of tobacco use, assess willingness to quit, assist the patient with a cessation plan, and arrange follow up, including behavioral and pharmaceutical strategies they feel are appropriate for the patient, he said.Doctors can also suggest that patients who are experiencing a cigarette craving eat a piece of fruit, a vegetable, or drink a glass of water help them avoid giving in to the urge to smoke, he added.Scott McIntosh, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at the University of Rochester, in New York, said the study was for finding an important relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and a smoker current level of addiction, as well as their future success with being abstinent from smoking.tells us that future research might not only confirm these relationships but will lead to interventions with smokers to incorporate changes in their diet to increase their chances of being successful with their quit attempts, Dr.

Only AA/KK with no diamonds? While JJ is pretty tough to get raised on, feels like a good spot to stack off with.

Notes: Again I'm doing this just for fun, and I think if you've read this far into my spoilers, then no amount of persuasion is going to keep you from cheating, hopefully you've reached this point honestly.

If you didn't, or think I'm a big numpty, well feel free to go ahead and write that on a little piece of paper and throw it into the trash. In the imgur image I posted above, and reposted at the end of this paragraph, you'll see my (futile) attempts to apply the rune translation from the Town Records onto Envelope A. RED letters are drawn from the same language Town Records, ORANGE letters are drawn from the opposing language, and the Green letters (the stupid N/H issue) are just wild guesses because I can't explain why the symbols don't line up. This doesn't do much unless you want to try and brute force the remaining letters, in which case you could assume letters like Q and X aren't appearing more than 1 2 times. Finally, you'll hopefully note three things on the German side which would make it my preferred side to decode:

Your accusation of me is incorrect, and this premise you created that "Literally no one on this planet "wants" that (war)" is incorrect as well.

I think Bernie missed his window, which feels weird saying since he was such a long shot to win the nomination two years ago. Bernie 2016 was a breath of fresh air because of the outsider y contrast he presented to Hillary, but now there are other potential and declared candidates that occupy that same niche but have more established records, a clearer story, and more charisma. I am not sure he will be more palatable this time around to mainline Democrats  while the party has moved ideologically towards him, some still hold grudges (unjustified or not) towards him for his actions in 2016. For example, one scientist I work with dislikes Bernie for taking a few weeks to concede after it was mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination. Senator Sanders will also probably continue to struggle to reach minority voters. Despite his excellent record on civil rights, I see no significant movement of minorities towards his camp.

If you own a suit, I don think you can really go wrong wearing a suit to an interview even with a casual dress company. My company is a super casual engineering firm, and we wouldn think twice about an interviewee showing up in a suit. That said, I also think you would be fine in a nice skirt and blouse. Personally, I would always rather be overdressed at an interview than underdressed, and you never really know what preconceived notions the person interviewing you might have. For example, I know for a fact that my own boss thinks it ridiculous that we have a casual dress code and he probably look more favorably on a candidate who went with professional attire for the interview.

Dude, don let your pride screw you over. Get out of your head. Getting something dosent mean someone else won Free food once a day will dare you money to get you back on your feet faster. People care about you and don want to see you at the bottom. Get up faster. At least look I to it. I speaking from personal experience, it not worth your pride not taking advantage of the opportunities you have, now at the bottom, or later when you see your success, take the opportunities.

Because handguns are easier to use, easy to conseal, lightweight, you can more easily find compatible ammo, magazines, and even carry several magazines in your pockets, they are very easy to reload quickly, and many have as many bullets in a mag as a legal rifle magazine. Also anyone who says that dual weilding pistols is impossible or even all that impractical is wrong. They are more accurate that one would think, easy to fix in the field, easier to suppress with items simply found around us, they are often not as loud as a rifle, and certainly quieter than a shotgun, they do not have a short range, they are honestly harder to fumble or drop, less recoil means faster refire while retaining a general ammount of accuracy, and 9mm (the most common pistol round) can penetrate most surfaces at close range. This is all assuming that we talking about a glock or M9. Magnums, revolvers, and other large round handguns are also common (though significantly less than say a glock), a 44. Round is strong enough that a shot to the chest comes with enough force to throw you on the ground like youve been shoved by someone twice your size, for comparison, a 9mm feels like a hard punch, six of these can be held in some revolvers, and can cause fatal trauma in a single shot to most areas of the torso, there are also semi automatic handguns that fire this round. There are also automatic handguns, magazines can have all manner of sizes of extended magazine, which, are difficult to aquire, though not impossible, and often the largest pistol magazines hold more than a rifle magazine.

Assad the war criminal, presiding over his little tinpot dictatorship, can now present his demands (for no more threats of military intervention, and no help to Syria rebels) to the world only remaining superpower in return for handing over weapons that are illegal anyway. The man who holds an illicit armoury can use that cache of arms as a bargaining chip to protect his own future. And Putin, the ex KGB autocrat presiding over a country with a dying population, a failing economy and a defunct military who was once cast by Obama as beyond the pale because of his unacceptable human rights record can bluster and preen as he delivers peace in our time. Yes indeed, it all going according to plan. So seriously does the Russian leader take this responsibility that he has been lecturing America on the subject, in its own newspaper of record. His article in The New York Times, humiliating the Obama administration with its sarcastic condescension, was a masterpiece of comic bravado. And the White House had no choice but to swallow it because it offered a blessed way out of an impossible corner, even while it blatantly insulted the president and his countrymen. need to use the United Nations Security Council [to preserve] law and order in today complex and turbulent world [in order to] prevent international relations from sliding into chaos.

A single person claimed this, not a bunch. Also, the person claiming it was dismissed halfway through the war for disagreements with the nazi leadership. Not exactly the most reliable source, especially since there is no other evidence that the nazis planned the fire. It certainly sounds like something they'd do, but you won't find many historical documents supporting it. Even Gring himself said he was full of shit, since they could've oppressed the communists with or without the fire. Which is definitely true, since by that point the party was almost completely outlawed.
The truth is that the symbolic weight of lynching is too great in American society to not rear its ugly head on a regular basis whenever white privilege feels threatened.

They raised it this year. The lowest pension in China today is 88 RMB per month. I bet most old rural people got this type of pension in China, somewhere around 100 RMB per month or a couple of hundreds. Might be higher in rural areas in richer provinces. In which province? Pensions might also differ between different areas within a province, some villages might be more generous than others. These low pensions are for rural areas. Pensions in cities should be at least 2000 per month, probably 3000 is common pension in Chongqing city. Heard some old guy in Beijing in a hutong who said he had a pension on around 5000 per month.

To gain real happiness in our lives, it appears that we must make it ourselves. This is precisely what Gretchen Rubin, creator of The Happiness Project, realized one day in the back of a taxi. In the midst of her own hectic life as an attorney and law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Rubin experienced an epiphany as her vaguely stated everyday goals and her failure to achieve them coalesced into the understanding that she was wasting her life.

There isn't any kind of universal certification for day spas (though there are usually state licensing requirements). Just because a place calls itself a day spa doesn't mean it's going to have the specific services you're looking for.

Typically, these require spa owners (and possibly employees) to pass background checks, submit the spa to regular health inspections, and ensure that any medical procedures are performed by trained and licensed individuals. Your state attorney general's Web site is usually to go to place for this kind of information. You can also ask spa staffers about them about it once you arrive there.

If a city passes the most restrictive law and gets their number of officially registered offenders way down, it could very well mean lots of ex offenders are still there but living off the grid.

Scopes: I never use the purple scopes over the Classic or 2x Bruiser. I large portion of the scopes are being avoided by the player base, and I think this should be addressed early in the games life. I suggest removing the Classic HCOG from the loot table and giving each scope in the game an option to go into a Classic HCOG type of scope. I don mind using a 4x 8x or 2x 4x if I could quickly go into a Classic HCOG when needed.

I done everything up to this point but still can manage to find the right settings in my BIOS. I completely uninstalled my old drivers, installed new ones, and tried to look around in the BIOS for the right settings. As I stated, both my North and South Bridge Configurations aren helpful, and navigating through some AMD PBS (or something like that) folders starts to look helpful, but ultimately doesn seem to change anything.

To really take this game one step further, I think it would be cool if the cops DIDNT know who the killer is, and they are really, actually trying to find that out. Say you have 8 "people", and you are on of them, "the killer"   but the cops don know who.

L'arrive de Jean Christophe Choblet a, semble t il, insuffl une nouvelle dynamique au projet qui en avait bien besoin. En effet, il a su montrer durant cette runion qu'il a vraiment "travaill son dossier", qu'il a su s'en saisir pleinement et en faisant des propositions ambitieuses. C'est ainsi que, par exemple, la dimension artistique, que nous appelions de nos vux, est remise au centre de la Promenade Urbaine. Voil donc une trs bonne nouvelle. Et ce n'est pas la seule, nous avons galement appris que le financement de l'clairage de mise en valeur du viaduc est finalement assur.
Note that it not necessarily a problem on its own, just that it placed a level of burden on the programmer to take care to an extent that we were uncomfortable with.Almost always, we would end up having to rethink the dependency on time for performance considerations, and typically would attach the time first to some relevant Event before making further use of it, which would allow for better caching of intermediate results.Eventually that turned into just dropping support for a current time behaviour altogether as we gradually came to realize it was regularly an issue. That not to say we wouldn like to also be able to support such a thing someday   and integration would be really nice as well   but if you want your FRP system to perform really well, these things add a high degree of complication, while there are many systems which don really turn out to need them.We do have a bunch of time based stuff here:but unfortunately, the thing I want to give you isn there. 
But if as a culture we insist that married couples keep all disagreement private, sex is something to be investigated, especially loud sex. least that what one unfortunate pot smoking New Jersey resident found out when police responded to a 911 call about screams.

The haunting thing about those diseases is it is so invasive and destructive to those who have it but somehow it seems it affects their loved ones and families even more. I think it is because we think so highly of these people who have endured through so much and worked their whole lives not just to provide for themselves but their whole families, and then they are stricken with this diseases that rapidly destroys their mental state and the ones who looked up to and admired them see them wither into a shell of themselves.

I use pipenv in production and testing to simplify deployment on systems that don natively support python 3.6+. When it works it is great. When it fails, or when the cli options fight each other and try to be smart but instead for a circular firing squad it is one of the most insanity inducing pieces of software I have ever used. Pipenv release have repeatedly broken CI builds for me for the past 3 months. I was so pissed with how bad it was about 9 months ago that I actually gave up trying to use it on my development machine and learned how to write gentoo ebuilds. On reflection it seems like the perfect tool for python   if you stay on the happy path and only use it in BDFL APPROVED ways then it can be great, be woe to the fool who wanders from the light into madness.

Gebt die gewnschte Menge Salz in eine Schssel und mischt ein wenig vom l dazu. Nehmt lieber erstmal nur wenig vom l, denn ihr knnt spter   je nach gewnschter Konsistenz   immer noch ein bisschen dazu geben. Nun kommt der Abrieb einer Bio Orange und etwas gehackter Rosmarin dazu. Ein paar Tropfen therisches Orangenl zufgen (nehmt hier aber bitte keines aus dem Supermarkt, das man als Raumduft bzw. fr Dufthuschen verwendet, sondern eines aus dem Reformhaus). Hat das Peeling die gewnschte Konsistenz, fllt es in ein hbsches Glas. Wegen dem Abrieb der Orangenschale wrde ich sagen ca. 2 Wochen. Wenn du es im Khlschrank aufbewahrst und immer mit einem Lffel entnimmst, vielleicht sogar 3 Wochen. Viele haben es in der Dusche oder bei der Badewanne stehen, da kommt beim Entnehmen schon mal Wasser rein und es ist oft sehr warm im Badezimmer das sind Faktoren die sich auf die Haltbarkeit negativ auswirken. Ich werde mal ein Peeling Rezept posten, dass sich auf jeden Fall mehrere Wochen hlt, da l und Salz an und fr sich nicht so schnell verderblich sind

You don have to talk. You both engagaged, and you acknowledge each other nonverbally   touches, glances etc. Pause to read some passage you liked to her or ask what a word or cultural reference means. 
I think my edge still will be my psychology background. I do understand what's going on in a way and with a perspective that poker players don't have. I am an outsider, which is a disadvantage because I don't have as much experience but it's an advantage because I have a different set of eyes and mindset, which I can use. I've figured out how to turn what's different about me and limitations   I'm new to this world, I'm a woman, I don't have a math background   and how I use that to my advantage. They're what make me unique. In poker you learn very quickly, if you play like everyone else, you'll be fine, but you'll never be great. The truly great players go beyond that and find their own style and be more creative and realize how everyone else is playing and play with that.

Then every sensory experience in daily life can be used as a signal for Self Remembering   the mind can instantly shift to the perspective of silent awareness in the Now, be awed with the mystery of life. Conscious creativity happens when the ego identification no longer prevents life from celebrating itself.My vision of the future:The purpose of life for the human body/mind is not to be a predictable, programed repetition of other ignorant peoples believes, knowledge or behaviors, but to be a temporary tool to manifest and express the presence of awareness, the unconditional love, the bliss, the peace, the formless form of life that we are.I am really good at:Assisting people in understanding the subconscious mind and its programming and in utilizing their intelligence and the five senses of the body to clearly discover the illusion of identification with body, emotions and mind.
