As the benefit of false disconnects in limit poker is much smaller, many poker rooms provide protection only on the limit or add special tables without protection on the no limit and pot limit. There is no disconnect protection in tournaments at all..

The bad news again, though, is that it doesn seem to attack the motor neurons in humans. That would tend to indicate that the paralysis is entirely pain driven. So it very likely that the spider is in unbelievable agony for the few weeks that it takes the larva to eat it. It possible it can sense pain from being eaten either because its nervous system overloads and shuts down, or that pain is drowned out by the pain from the venom, but either way, huge quantities of pain are very likely.

The big hands you show down with strange bluffs are often the ones that people remember clearly; they forget all the times you show up in big pots with the nuts because they expect it. 
If one of the banker's hands is identical to the player's hand, the player is considered to have a "copy" hand and the banker wins that hand. If both hands are tied, or if the banker wins either the high or low hand and the other is tied, the banker wins the player's bet. If the player wins one hand and ties the other, the game is a push where neither side wins money..

I have an unknown type of autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. My type of it is so rare that they haven even seen it before. Getting diagnosed was a multi year struggle.

I've gotten the same response when I told people I was getting a dog from a breeder they usually say "just look at shelters until you find that specific dog" but an opportunity to get the kind of dog I wanted arose so I seized the opportunity, because it's not a super common type of dog to find at a shelter and I want to have it for the longest amount of time possible so I'm getting it as a puppy. I see no shame in buying as long as you're going to care for the dog to the best of your ability.

Typically, Mikko would have "chicken or fish   no pork or beef   iced tea with Splenda or water, and fruit like bananas, pineapple, mango, and honeydew. Heavier meats, sugar, and caffeine would provide a temporary boost but would bite me in the butt later. Sitting at a table for anywhere from a couple hours to 31 hours (my longest session) isn't great exercise, so if I ate that stuff, I would get jittery, sleepy, or lose focus. My main snacks of choice during game time were salads." And, of course, alcohol was completely off limits.

Suddenly as I lying there I feel warm, wet, liquid squirt onto my back over the towel and over my singlet. It was a no oil massage, and I have had a boyfriend for two years in the past, I know what that stuff feels like landing anywhere on my body. I then heard him zip up his pants and at this point im completely frozen and disgusted and scared thinking how vulnerable I am. I lie there for a bit and pretend to get a neck cramp and he tries to keep going and I say I can and apologize and say it wasn his fault my neck just cramps up sometimes. I go pay and grab my stuff (they stole one of my shopping bags) but I did not care I just wanted to get away from there.

My parents were already worried about me doing this drive alone and I guess I wanted to prove that I wasn a little kid anymore who screams when someone says "boo". It was pure 19 year old stupidity. If this has happened now, when I less afraid of how people will judge me and when I finally realized my own safety is more important than seeming rude, I sure this would have played out differently. 
My parents were strict, but not overly so, and it was probably for my benefit.

I'm in week 6 or so of Hanson's training plan for June marathon. Yesterday I had a tempo run scheduled but I couldn't hit the pace as there were five inches of snow on all the sidewalks. I put in more effort than an easy run but didn't end up going much faster. Probably was not as much effort as I would have put into the goal pace since I was mostly focused on not falling. I don't feel fatigued from it.

For example, in poker, one should not always bet the good hands and fold the bad hands. In contrast, in a perfect information game, a subgame can be solved with information just from that subgame, and there is no need to balance with other subgames.Now, in our NIPS 17 paper (which won a best paper award at the conference), and our Science paper (that was just published in the last few hours), we do present techniques for theoretically sound subgame solving in imperfect information games.

It may very well be that one major response to Assad victory in holding the coast of Syria is to try and reimagine Sunni political power in the region as being centered amongst those disenfranchised at the moment by Iranian clients in both Iraq and Syria. I doubt ISIL will ever be around for that, but it clear that gulf strategy along with their money and diplomatic entreaties will be pushing the groups which emerge from this bloodletting in that direction. So the actual moniker of ISIL will probably perish (it so clunky anyway) but I bet the idea and a lot of the people behind it will regroup and reemerge possibly more successfully.

Its possible to get out of the trench on one of its ends with very careful jumping technique. The key is to control your momentum and arc of your jump such that you don touch the wall, and you can juuust barely land on the outcroppings and ledges.

There are now just as many RE games without the tank controls and fixed camera angles than there are with them. The best RE games do not use them, in fact. I know you have all this love for the older games, but stop letting that turn you silly. Of fuckin course RE4 and RE7 are Resident Evil games. The series is allowed to expand and experiment past its roots that it put down 20 years ago. It just so happens the series is better off for it.

Personally, I just don't find her overly inspiring or charismatic. Her big moments during senate investigations felt like poorly orchestrated "gotcha" moments. She was desperate to score that sound byte. Everyone does it, but the better ones don't make it quite so obvious. As an aside, she also has already been the major target of the NRA and is considered the 2nd amendment boogie man to the right. Some will view that as insignificant, others will think it's a death knell due to the Midwest. I'm not sure the importance, but it is a consideration.

The most important thing to find out is what sort of tear it is and what surgery would entail. A full meniscectomy is basically the end of running. A repair would be the best, but has a longer and harder recovery. A partial meniscectomy (which I had in both knees) will vary depending on how much needs to be cut out.

Especially when you realize that just qualifying into ro32 or ro16 itself is a substantial achievement and means you already in the "best of the best" tier of all players. 
But once businesses become powerful enough, why the hell would they just sit and wait for negative reports to come out about their company? Just buy the press, tell the public whatever you want. Some dastardly rogue prints the truth about you? Spin it, discredit it, fuck even assassinate it.

If you can work out the odds   on the fly   of what cards are left in the pack and the likelihood of the cards you need turning up later in the game, then you are immediately above the majority of players who are simply hoping that their card will turn up. 
In addition to the traditional postage stamp, it bore a peculiar seal, the brainchild of a Danish postal clerk, Einar Holboll. Rather than rely on a few deep pockets to pay for a new hospital for children with tuberculosis, he sold the seals for two ore (there are 100 ore in a Danish krone) each. Patrons placed the seals alongside regular stamps to raise awareness of the campaign.

Haha. I sure what I thinking isn a reality, but I feel like OP might have been "flying like a little birdie" a long with me earlier today. I learned some infuriating information about the DOJ and Speacial Agent, who likely played with "Kat" at least as far as to try to help her maintain her unrealistic cover at Auto Trader. Yep, I being super vague here but what/who I was introduced to today blew my freaking mind! Made the "temparature of my blood" nearly kill me! I knew there was/is disgusting corruption amongst the entire DOJ system but I seriously cannot believe what I learned is NOT against the law. In order to uninvite offensive comments, which are not very common in this sub, I trying not to name places I visited today and the people who shared the information. If you were there and read the exchanges, you know exactly what/who I talking about. KW and that Special Agent, Debra Stauss. the one who called Manitowoc SO asking, practically BEGGING, to be a part of the Teresa Halbach/Steven Avery investigation before it was even an investigation. She sounded so incredibly desperate to be part of hanging Steven Avery. Nasty!

In 2009 there were over 100 bikes registering for the poker run and a few more events were scheduled on Saturday. For 2010, the event evolved into a 3 day rally with a Friday night concert, continuing the Show Shine, Biker Rodeo hosted by ABATE District 1, and an outstanding Fallen Firefighter Tribute coordinated by the Castle Rock Fire Department Color Guard. Over 180 bikes registered for the poker run on Sunday morning. Throughout the 3 day event over 1500 people came out and enjoyed our rural style of fun. The Rally Committee's goal is to keep expanding the event in future years and increasing our contributions to the Colorado Fallen Firefighter Foundation.

One time a dude on my floor was threatening to hurt himself and said that if cops showed up he kill himself rather than let himself be institutionalized.

That happened during the time Belgium was a "enlightened post WW2" nation.Pineloko  4 points  submitted 6 months agoWhat you saying is bassically "by the time of annexation the extreme brutal treatment already ended" you aren showing some examples of how it was still terrible.The problem here is that you comparing a bad situation(colonialism) to some idealized fictional version of how things should be in a perfect world.I comparing it to what actually happened after independence.They wanted independence because they wanted to make their own decisions about their own future. Instead they got endless dictatorships and warlords fighting for personal profit.They believed they were being robbed and will be more prosperous once they self governing, instead they went into economic decline and stagnation.How hard is it to admit that colonialism wasn ideal while also admitting that rushed sudden decolonization left these countries in a non functional state.I gave you a source as asked that chronicles the evolution of the conditions of workers.

Phones can hack, most to a decent degree depending on your use case. However!!! Unrooted phones usually will not work for actually running programs needed to "real" hacking so jump on Google and find out if you can root yours. Also, solo learn is great and easy for quick understanding of programming but once your ready to start messing around, you need a terminal emulator for Android, a USB adapter and or a wifi dongle for packet injection stoof. Really phones while capable, suck for this. I recommend either pm a pro or me(not pro) on how to fix your laptop, or snag a raspberry pi 3b+ kit with case and either use your phone as or buy a screen and mouse/ keyboard and learn a shit ton as you setup, personalize, and experiment with Kili Linux.

Young people of Reddit, why do you still smoke? I get the older generations do because growing up, they may not have known better. Smoking increases anxiety and stress. The only reason you feel "relief" from smoking is because your body is "stressing" you out until you smoke. Smokers who think it's curing their stress are using circular logic. The stress is elevated from craving the nicotine. Any relief is just temporary, and elevated by their addiction.

It still a small sample, but he is very good along the ice with his long legs, he got a wingspan of a pterodactyl, and makes saves to keep his team in the game, also ones he probably shouldn At times his glove hand can be like a frying pan like so many NHL goalies today who don catch pucks with the flash of Grant Fuhr.

My daughter is my fourth child and much healthier than my other three and I am very lax with her when it comes to dirt. She is quite disgusting but I still take her to doctors, get her vaccinated, give her necessary medications. I was on antidepressants through my entire pregnancy with her and while breastfeeding. She was the most chilled baby I had ever seen and I felt super guilty cause I thought I was drugging her but my gynae and paed said that my mental health is also extremely important so I continued with my medication. My kids were also all born a bit premature and thank God for doctors. Giving me the necessary medications to help their little lungs, giving me c sections because the babies didn engage into my pelvis. Who knows if I would have survived child birth if we had no doctors. I had so many people talking bullshit to me my whole life of big pharma and doctors just do csections for money and asthma medication makes you worse and and and but I am so grateful that I can see the benefits and not believe that crap. It hard to know the truth when you brain is still developing as a child/young adult.

Postflop: Player A bets $30. Minimum raise for player B is now $60 (in some sense, player A was "raising" a zero dollar bet by $30, so player B must do at least the same.) if player B raises to $60, the next player, whether it is Player A or player c, would be allowed to raise to as little as$90 if they elect to raise.

Of course that doesn't much matter when you're standing next to someone. so, shoes, by shoes that have taller heels (no I'm not saying to wear stilettos or high heels) like typical men's dress shoes, that also have decent cushioning in them. In fact they actually sell inserts that raise your heels up inside the shoe, and make you gain an addition 1 3inches they claim, although, I've never tried them. They also claim they are good for your posture. Which is yet another important factor, standing straight and tall is huge, I don't think it's ironic at all. That standing your tips of your toes more so than you're heels makes you stand taller and is just the same good for posture.
Did you try Aimovig yet? (Or one of the related CGRP blockers from other companies, depending on your location) Only preventative medication that has actually been able to make a difference for me.

I also believe that a core problem with our music callings is that there no accountability, the way a Primary teacher is accountable to a Primary president, and a Relief Society president is accountable to a bishop.

Whatever activity you are engaged in (standing, sitting, walking, running), stick out your butt and put too much curve into your low back. Then slowly flatten your back as much as possible by tucking your lower pelvis forward. Go back and forth between these extremes while imagining someone standing on your shoulders. The spot where it feels like you could best support the weight is likely your optimal curvature! Try to maintain this curvature as you stand, walk, sit, or run (with most people, this will involve teaching yourself to hold a little bit of tension in your ab muscles).

I disagree with your entire second paragraph. Apart from that logic being completely unfounded (as if ppl go to art school and get a road to fame and fortune immediately upon graduation). Believe it or not ppl would still go to school for music, theatre and art and dedicate themselves completely to it despite finances. As a matter of fact thats pretty much what ppl end up doing half the time anyway. The quality of art isnt going to decline, thats just irrational fear mongering. First, quality and what art is good vs bad is completely subjective. I can just as easily make an unprovable statement and say all the education of the last 100 years has stifled art and the quality of art today is worse than it was however long ago. Theyre both silly remarks.

Many of these trials are run by Contract Research Organisations (CRO's) who work as intermediaries between the drug companies and the researchers and have created an industry that has developed many of these processes. More often than not the representatives of these companies have little knowledge about the pathology or clinical features of the disease in question, which in itself leads to endless unnecessary questions and further paperwork when they come to sites to monitor patients within trials. These processes take up an inordinate amount of time and in some way help explain the exponential rising cost of clinical trials and in part the rising price of new drugs.

I not really sure how to compensate for that. Innate slow movement seems like it would be too deadly for a race that can read teleport scrolls, but maybe an ability that trades movement speed for a larger silence radius (or gradually shrinks it back and returns your speed over the course of a few turns) would make things interesting. Or maybe their insubstantial form should come with armor restrictions or severely reduced armor effectiveness to make walking up and hitting things in the face less attractive. Maybe all of the above.

I made a friend in junior high. That year my area had a once in a century spring flood that pretty much everyone helped out in some way with. In our classes case by helping out at the food shelter. My mom went to a lunch with a large group of cousins and sat beside one she barely knew. Both of them started talking about their kids and how they had been helping out during the flood. They clued in we must be in the same class. Then narrowed it down to who we actually were. Turns out me and my friend were 2nd cousins. If this was a small town it would not big a surprise, but we live in a decent sized city.

I see the logic in the argument. Though one could argue that due to a stagnation of wages, minimum wage has failed to rise with inflation and has actually dropped. All these min wage raises did was bring people up to inflation. And if their labour hasn changed then it makes sense to keep them at the same buying power.

You should ensure that it is deep set so that it does not scratch when the chips are rubbed together, or if someone handles them a lot. If you find that the chip does this, it is likely that it is not the high quality that you seek and deserve. If necessary, you can avoid hot stamped poker chips altogether and aim for those that have engraved lettering and numbers in them. These types seem to be more durable.

Performance pressures of physical exhaustion was induced via an exercise protocol consisting of intervals of maximal exertion undertaken on a watt bike.Results: At a group level, under physical pressure elite athletes were faster to respond to control trials on the Stroop Task and to simple probabilistic choices on the CGT. Physical pressure was also found to increase risk taking for decisions where probability outcomes were explicit (on the CGT), but did not affect risk taking when probability outcomes were unknown (on the BART). There were no significant correlations in the degree to which individuals' responses changed under pressure across the three tasks, suggesting that elite athletes did not show consistent responses to physical pressure across measures of decision making.

Another acquaintance of mine, let's call him Abraham, doesn't have two fingers that point in the same direction because they've each been broken by some of his more perceptive and violent marks. I last spoke with him in 2011, just after Christmas. He was in the hospital with broken ribs and a shattered collarbone after one of his cons went wrong. But he didn't plan to stop, because he wasn't doing it for the money (he was actually sorta rich). He was doing it for the thrill. For example, everyone understands that you never grab people by the hand, even in a playful manner, because that's a great way to get a black eye and ruin business for everyone else. And who enforces those rules? Why, your fellow performers, who have taken it upon themselves to monitor your behavior.

System can increase use of any substance if it suits the user and the user had a reason to want more of the substance. That an across the board thing as applicable to caffeine as it is to crack. Not everyone wants more of the substance they using though, and nicotine isn especially known for ramping up/diminishing returns like crack is. My observation is that most people don increase use of nicotine just because it easy and relatively consequence free to do so. Ever hear of someone ramping up their use of nicotine lozenges/gum? Not so much. I don know about pods, but everyone I know who vapes has to mix their own nicotine into the carrier, so we can easily tweak it up or down in strength, by minute amounts if we like. Over the last few years all of my friends have either lowered their strengths or stayed the same. How often they/we vape is harder to observe but no one observably more thumb sucky than they were before.

2) Theoretically, it should be possible to run the build scripts and ensure the output is the same as the published built files. This provides some safeguarding against code injection attacks. Without both the source and the build information (hopefully the build tools are specified as dev dependencies), this isn possible. Similarly to point 1, it is also much easier to look for security vulnerabilities (intentional or otherwise) in source code than minified.

According to the Bush Doctrine, the US has the right to both attack countries that harbor terrorists and also engage in preemptive wars with countries that might pose a threat at some point in the future.

To me the most interesting thing to come out Korea was the Makemodel series. I haven researched it much, but I suspect it was meant to be something to be used for the all the anma joints (sex parlors disguised as massage parlors) or gunma joints (same but no sex) and be censored or blurred out, but the photographer collection got leaked. It was one of the first times where actual Korean models, the type that you see in Kpop (not as hot, but still) got exposed. All uncensored. You then had the Korean prostitution scandal in Japan where a bunch of escorts got leaked giving their services to a Japanese guy. That was probably the best quality stuff you can get without going back 10 years ago or so. Otherwise, you have the softcore movies where they pretend to bang each other but seem to have absolutely no idea how to do the ol in and out. The actresses are pretty hot though. You also have dedicated fan cammers who try to get sneak shots of their idols. There is a subreddit for that.

Pair is a singular noun, so when it's the subject it takes a singular verb: pair has "This pair of chickens has a bad attitude." previous answer misses the point entirely: it depends on how it is used, eg; She has a pair of stockings, they have a pair of stockings. The question isn't asking if it's "has a pair" or "have a pair". It does depend on the context, however   If you're considering the items in the pair individually, use it like a plural subject, but if it's a single entity (pair of scissors, for example), use it like a singular subject.

Most atherosclerotic plaques are firmly bonded to the artery wall. It is rare for plaque to suddenly break free, travel through the circulation, and block an artery in the brain. It is far more common for small breaks in the surface of a plaque to cause fragile blood clots that can easily break free.

Again, if the situation were reversed and straight couples were denied visitation rights, most people would see that things need to change.

At her age 66, Louisa will be able to receive employment pensions of $5,666 per month plus $976 CPP and $570 OAS. Harry is receiving $912 from CPP and $600 from OAS. All this adds up to $8,724 per month. On top of that, they would receive rental income of $1,600 per month to make total income $10,324 per month. Add Harry RRIF drawdown of $560 per month and they would have pre tax monthly income of $10,884 or $130,608 per year. Assuming that this income is fairly evenly split and pension and age credits applied, they would have annual individual incomes of $65,304. After 20 per cent average tax, they would have $8,700 to spend per month. That $1,300 below their $10,000 monthly after tax income target.

The notion that two people should marry by their own decision and for "true love" is a fairly modern notion, it didn start to go mainstream in the west until around the 18th century. For most of human history in both time and place marriage was FAR more about producing social/economic/political alliances between families. The people involved in the marriage typically had little to say in the matter..
