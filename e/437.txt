Garlan the motherfucking Gallant is straight up one of the best dudes to show up in the books. When Tyrion is basically persona non grata in Joffrey court, Garlan is the only person to publicly honour him for his role in the Blackwater defence. When Joffrey is trying to humiliate Tyrion, Garlan stands up for him and disparages Joffrey behaviour, in front of everyone. Then you have him being a master swordsman/warrior who led the Tyrell force that lifted the Blackwater siege, training against 3 men in the yard because battles aren 1 on 1, etc.

I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902 1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

They mostly only eat jellyfish because of course they do, they could only eat something that has no brain and a possibility of drifting into their mouths I guess. Everything they do eat has almost zero nutritional value and because it so stupidly fucking big, it has to eat a ton of the almost no nutritional value stuff to stay alive. Dumb. See that ridiculous open mouth? (This is actually why this is my favorite picture of one, and I have had it saved to my phone for three years) "Oh no! What could have happened! How could this be!" Do not let that expression fool you, they just don have the goddamn ability to close their mouths because their teeth are fused together, and ya know what, it is good it floats around with such a clueless expression on its face, because it is in fact clueless as all fuck.
She was cared for when she walked off, so why did it matter that you didn attend to get personally? Why is she concerned with you talking to Natalie in particular? If I had to guess, this feels like jealousy. A friend invited you to hang out in a group, and got irritated when you did just that.. 
I had also become acutely aware that I was a role model for kids, which I felt like I was supposed to find cool but actually found upsetting. My great "contribution" to society was walking onto an overlit Nickelodeon set shouting lines about fried chicken (my character liked fried chicken) and that's what kids were looking up to? Granted, we can't all be Pema Chodron, but there was something about the shallowness of my success that made me resent it..

Absolutely   actually the first month I was on them I felt I was "blissfully neutral"   like the come up of an ecstasy trip without the good part after onset. The main difference I see now is if I forget to take the pills a) serious withdrawal symptoms (puking, brain zaps, feeling dizzy, etc.) but also I be in tears by the afternoon, so my body has definitely come to rely on it since I can feel the fallout without those chemicals. BUT taking them also gets me super anxious, an odd side effect for an anti anxiety medication. Personally I would be more bold to get off them, but have PTSD and other issues, so afraid to go down that route again.

As it happens it was Johnny who got me started. I raised his BB (for the third time) with pocket nines. The flop was Q92 and I checked even though I was last to act. The turn was another Queen and I bet weak. He called and we saw a Jack on the river. He led out betting 500 on, what I assumed was a stone cold bluff. But I raised him 500 anyway, and he promptly went all in with another raise. I showed my 9s and the two times world champ exited stage left. And my ego is now as big as my mate Phil's.

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

The term "dashboard" didn't originate with traffic jams that made drivers want to dash their head against something hard in the hopes of losing consciousness, but instead was passed down to us from the horse and buggy days. Fans of the song "Jingle Bells" have long known that the proper speed for a one horse open sleigh was "dashing," but when horses started to dash along o'er the fields, bells on bobtails weren't the only things ringing. The cries of the driver and passenger likely also rang out as they got splattered with mud, meaning that spirits were definitely not bright, and laughing all the way wasn't an option. So along came a piece of wood that protected the buggy's passengers from all the mud and slush, which was known as the dashboard.
Your idea of buying a SFH to live in and fix up is a good idea. If you work with a Realtor you will probably find a few homes in the area of your choice that have been sitting a while because they are outdated and could use your modern vision. In a home like this you could also rent out a room or two while you are doing your renovations and this will help offset your mortgage expense.

The point is that a dark joke that makes light of a serious and traumatic situation or experience may or may not be funny for people who haven been through that, but for people who have lived through it, if the person telling the joke isn one of them, from their subjective perspective that joke is probably going to misrepresent the situation, which is probably going to be careless and upsetting and ultimately not funny for them.

Basically we had a very meaningful exchange in a short period of time. A week later he is dead. On the night of the day he died I was waiting for my train home from work. While waiting I noticed a stationary glowing green bar of light high up on the wall. I looked around thinking somebody was projecting this glowing green bar of light. No one was around. At that point the light went shooting down the train tunnel. The light was glowstick green and bright. I felt at the time it was Kevin saying hello and goodbye. This is the ONLY time I had any personal experience after someone death. I had closer friends die and never experienced a thing aside from dreams about them.

Das diese Leistungen seit 1996 (oder lnger) keine Preis/Tarif Anpassung erfahren hat, bedeutet das der Physiotherapeut alleine durch die Teuerungbedingte Abwertung 24,7% weniger verdient als 1996. Dazu kommen die gestiegenen Mietpreise, die hheren Kosten von Gerten, Versicherungen und so weiter.

A wise realized person should do tasks just as an ignorant attached person would but the wise person should do tasks without attachment for the benefit of the world. 
"Not true!", some would say, but those people are misunderstanding what I trying to convey. Yes, as individuals, and on an individualistic basis, we can be beautiful creatures, but "nature" is designed in a way to not favor our virtues, it is made to reward our immoral behaviors. The evil, corrupt and morally devoid can live by their own set of rules as long as they aren caught within the laws that struggling humans flail about in an effort to uphold them.

The most reasonably priced hair salons I have visited were in OR; both in Portland and Corvallis. 
On the other hand I also think 99,9% of the time it is not, because they don like the curls, but more because they see a rare state of yours. As I was younger I loved to wear my hair down, but I always only got compliments for putting it into a pony tail. Curious of what would happen, I only wore pony tails for one year and after that would occasionally wear it down   suddenly everyone complimented me for wearing it down. Since then I am convinced that some new or special occassion hair style (no matter how simple) will always give you more positive attention, regardless of how beautiful your usual style is. Long story short: Your hair texture rocks, people just hype unusual things.

Can also kind of set things up with the roommates or other trusted friends to have some ways of seeing or hearing you guys have sex, but no way to participate, like a chain lock on a door that can be secured, but left ajar.

Also, tipping is an awkward subject no matter what situation you are in, but do you have to tip in a casino? Aren't they getting enough of your money already? Well, you've come to the right place.

Free beverages for customers while they are playing, discounted rates on hotel rooms, and free meals are the most common complimentaries given by casinos.

If you get to the Turn and you hold only two unsuited overcards (two cards higher that any cards on the board) with no flush or straight draws, then you should fold if there is a bet in front of you.

So know I know as much German as my dog, though I sure we butcher it. We taught: sitz, platz, bleib, hier, steh, fuss, aus. We should have been better about using nein fo no, as we about to have a baby and it would be nice to speak separately to the dog and the baby. But it is hard with a puppy to not just blurt out no when they have something dangerous in their mouth.

We act docile, hand over documents, lie about the sesame balls we have in the backseat because they are both contraband and because we cannot imagine that such delicious treats can present a threat to the security of the country (although perhaps this is a failure of imagination on our part since clearly sesame balls must be dangerous to the territorial integrity of the United States or why else would we all be engaging in this ritual of border creation in the first place?)..

The few Republicans like Michigan Representative Justin Amash who have spoken against Trump's emergency declaration largely oppose executive overreach   not the border wall itself.Citing a near 40 year low for illegal border crossings, former national security officials published a statement Monday denying that there is an emergency that "entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border."Some Republican former members of Congress also published a letter Monday urging current GOP lawmakers to put the Constitution over their party loyalty by supporting the resolution.House GOP leaders are instructing members to oppose the resolution, according an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins told reporters last week she would vote for the resolution as long as no objectionable amendments are attached. North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece that he too would vote for the measure, saying, "I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress.".

ALEFANTIS: Well, we make everything from scratch. Other restaurants, even good restaurants, will, like, not roast their own peppers. You can just buy the roasted peppers in a can. Or you can buy garlic oil. Some products you can get, and they're consistent and they're easy. But I didn't even know that existed actually until they said that. I was like, "What do you mean? There's another way? You can just buy these things?" Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on.

Became aware of multiple ways in which diet might influence smoking and quitting. researchers randomly surveyed 1000 cigarette smokers aged 25 years and older from around the United States, using random digit dialing telephone interviews. They then contacted the participants again 14 months later, asking whether they had abstained from smoking and other tobacco use for at least the previous month.They found that the cigarette smokers who ate fruits and vegetables an average of 4 or more times per day were 3 times more likely to be abstinent from all tobacco products, including cigarettes, 14 months later, compared with those who ate fruits and vegetables fewer than 2 times per day (PThis held true even after controlling for age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, household income, and behavioral indicators of general health orientation.Those who ate more fruits and vegetables also exhibited fewer measures of dependence.They were less likely to smoke 20 or more cigarettes per day (Pwho eat more fruits and vegetables may be more health conscious to begin with and therefore be more amenable to smoking cessation, Haibach said.surveys indicate that people who smoke cigarettes are more likely to binge drink, use illicit drugs, and exercise less, and we controlled for this using exercise, heavy drinking, and street drug use as markers of general health orientation, he added.However, residual confounding may still exist, and the researchers recommend further research, including studies that incorporate all dietary factors and experimental studies.For now, doctors should continue to ask all of their patients about tobacco use.their patients who use tobacco, they should ask about tobacco use at each visit, advise of consequences of tobacco use, assess willingness to quit, assist the patient with a cessation plan, and arrange follow up, including behavioral and pharmaceutical strategies they feel are appropriate for the patient, he said.Doctors can also suggest that patients who are experiencing a cigarette craving eat a piece of fruit, a vegetable, or drink a glass of water help them avoid giving in to the urge to smoke, he added.Scott McIntosh, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at the University of Rochester, in New York, said the study was for finding an important relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and a smoker current level of addiction, as well as their future success with being abstinent from smoking.tells us that future research might not only confirm these relationships but will lead to interventions with smokers to incorporate changes in their diet to increase their chances of being successful with their quit attempts, Dr.

However, the most likely downside to these acrylic add ons is infection, which can result from improper application, the technician using unsterilized tools, or the nails being jarred loose during everyday activities.
