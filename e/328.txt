In the intangible category, appealing also makes sense. The City of Berkeley is embarking on what could be a lengthy power struggle, stretching over decades, to determine whose city this is. One view is that it's home to more than 100,000 residents, including students, employees and faculty members of the University of California at Berkeley. The contrary view is that it's become just one vast industrial park to be sliced and diced at the behest of the local industry, which happens to be in the sports biz at this site.

In 1997, ABC had the brilliant idea to cross over all their TGIF shows in one huge television event. It was like a televised MCU, if you removed every single reason one might like the MCU.

And then, when Coney Island Democrat Pamela Harris found out the feds were on to her, she instructed witnesses to lie to investigators, according to an 11 count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn federal court.Prosecutors say Harris, 57, who was arrested Tuesday, accepted $35,000 in City Council discretionary funds for a non profit she ran before taking office   but instead funneled the dough into her personal bank account, before spending the cash on frilly things from Victoria's Secret, paying down the mortgage on her Coney Island home, and dropping $10,000 on vacations with her husband.Harris, who was elected to a two year term in 2016, refused to say whether she would step down as she left Brooklyn federal court Tuesday afternoon.Prosecutors say she forged a lease stating she was renting space for her Coney Island youth non profit Generation Gap, when in reality, she ran the group out of her own Neptune Avenue house and pocketed the funds, an indictment states.She is also accused of stealing nearly $25,000 from a federal program to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy by taking aid meant for displaced storm victims.Despite being able to stay in her Neptune Avenue home, she claimed she was displaced and forged a lease and rent receipts to collect $1,500 a month in federal emergency housing money, the indictment alleges.She also is accused of committing bankruptcy court fraud by hiding $10,000 in investments and lying about her income when she filed for Chapter 13 protection in November 2013, prosecutors say.Harris, elected to the Assembly in 2015, caught wind of the FBI investigation in 2016 and, despite her oath of office, instructed two witnesses to lie to the feds, prosecutors allege."The brazen corruption charged as a result of this investigation tramples on the very definition of a public servant," Department of Investigation Commissioner Mark Peters said in a statement.Political mentor and Coney Island Councilman Mark Treyger   who is not named in the indictment   has directed at least $65,000 in city funds to Harris's non profit since 2014, public records show.Treyger spokesman Aaron Hecht said the allegations are "serious and troubling, and are deeply disappointing if true."The cash came after the council tightened restrictions on discretionary spending in 2014 to tamp down on corruption.If convicted, Harris could face up to 30 years imprisonment for making false statements to FEMA; 20 years each on wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice conspiracy charges; and five years apiece on five other fraud charges, prosecutors said.A friend posted her $150,000 bail, and Judge Ramon Reyes limited her travel to New York City, Long Island and Albany."[Harris] has pleaded not guilty and we look forward to our day in court and an opportunity there to present the full facts," lawyer Joel Cohen said. "Importantly, none of the allegations contained in the indictment relate to Ms. Harris's conduct in office.".

I also see how disregard for Biblical has led many astray and causes untold amounts of pain and suffering.

My father has always been a conservative who leans a bit more libertarian and is even slightly socially liberal, yet has always been active in local politics including being the county Republican Party chairman for a while. He was a firm believer in the whole "lesser than of two evils" and that a vote towards a third party candidate is a wasted vote even if he likes them and agrees with them more and has been something we clash on a lot. Last year he became a registered independent because "this Republican Party, is not the party I support or signed up to be a part of" he's very much a Reagan Republican (which is still a can of worms) and I truly have never respected my father more for taking a stand in what little way he can because of integrity. I wish the party had a spine. It's now clearly Trumps party.

My problem with the "she using old anti Jewish tropes and is therefore anti semetic" is that almost every single negative trope has been applied to Jews over the years, it would be difficult to come up with a negative description of AIPAC that wasn some way at some time to slur Jews.

It interesting. Since I do genealogy I also asked myself many times how far back we can go. Like what is the longest bloodline we can trace (not dynasty, not royal, any family)? The answers that I found was Confucius and Ramses II (people found out they are likely descendants from him, he had 100 children). Even if that wrong, I think the oldest lines we can trace back are those to Egypt because, well, we know people that lived in Egypt in that time XD They are going to make more DNA analysis of Egyptian kings and we will be able to proof it. By the way the oldest proven relation was found in my state in Germany. DNA analysis of skeletons showed that people in a nearby village are direct descendants of 3,000 years old people. They even made pictures of how these ancestors looked like when they were alive. Pretty cool!

My wife works in film/television, and all your advice is definitely spot on, but not just for film/television. Literally every person who wants to do business, whether it themselves as a "brand" or just to generate a revenue stream, needs to have a plan, see what the competition is up to, and then spend a minimum amount of time, money, and effort to be competitive to gain market share (in this case, viewers and subscribers). And that only going to happen if you have something compelling to offer.

Should I even bother with the test day?My other concern is the overall intensity of the comp block. It rarely goes 80%, and never goes above 85%.

This guy doesn even know that women have 12 periods a year unless they get pregnant or don have them monthly for a health reason. Even if he was right about needing 10 tampons for your period, which is why wrong since they have to be changed every 4 8 hours so that at least 3 6 tampons a day, AT LEAST, he would be wrong about how many are needed. At the very least, this is if the girl is one of the lucky ones with a 3 day long period and she only has to change it 3 times a day since that the least amount of times that you can change it, that nine per cycle and that the lowest it can be.

According to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, about half of all massage therapists work part time. However, as the BLS notes, this does not mean that the therapist provides massage or bodywork 40 hours a week. Massage therapy can be taxing on a practitioner's body, which restricts the number of hours per day, and per week, that a massage therapist can work. Those who do work full time will spend at least some of their work hours engaged in business management and marketing activities; they may perform practical tasks such as cleaning linens and other equipment; or, they may engage in other professional activities such as teaching or writing.

Since the multifidus muscle is a stabilizer of the spine, any delay in muscle firing may lead to abnormal biomechanics.

After the caster begins casting the spell, the flame will move from its circle to the caster, setting the caster aflame until the spell is cast. The caster then decides how much of their life force is sacrificed by selecting a number of hit points (minimum of 5). If the caster sacrifices all of their hit points, the caster dies after the spell is cast. If the spell is interrupted, the caster reduces his maximum hit points by the amount chosen until the end of a long rest.
This of course ensured that all Nicaraguans backed the militant group of students called "Sandanistas". They of course inherited a cluster   a country where homelessness and poverty and illiteracy were prevalent. So the net result of this turmoil is that Americans are fearful of traveling to Nicaragua, and Nicaragua doesn't have enough tourism to justify building the type of infrastructure that Americans would demand/enjoy. 
I agree. This feels like yet another attempt of the machine to shame us into voting for a half assed candidate when there an ideal candidate standing right next to him/her. This is just a longer version of the "Don be so picky, Liberals!" FB memes. Screw that. Social manipulation didn work in 2016 and it won work this time around. If you want to win, the put up or shut up. If your voting record, the alignment of "donors" to certain votes on critical policies stink, then clean it up.

Not the other way around.
When you say "a pair of glasses", you are referring to the "pair of lenses", not the frame. The frame holding the two lenses makes us think that it is one object, when the word "glasses" refers only to the lenses, not the frame. That is why it is called "a pair of glasses".

I think it because the role of mother is pretty esteemed in a lot of societies so the insult of their mother is like the worst insult. In Vietnamese,  m (in the north) and  m (in the south) means "fuck your mom" is one of if not the most insulting thing you can say to someone. I mean, in some cultures it can be used as a compliment like my BIL said that in the Black community, if you eat something good say like a a great peach cobbler, you would say, "This cobbler is slap your mom good." It is very bad to slap your mom but the cobbler is so good that you might do the unthinkable.
A) My making of an Atheist post does not necessarily bring with it a contempt for Christianity or any other religion, for that matter. Such thinking is generally "perpetuated" by the religious, who often by virtue of their own belief system, must have polar opposites; black and white, good and evil, yin and yang. Such things are the very basis for the constrictive, cognitive dissonance that is much of the "holy books" or scripture.

The location has already been described to you accurately, but I will chime in to make sure you are aware that the G spot is not actually universally pleasurable, and even if it is pleasurable most women cannot orgasm from that exclusively. It common for women to go looking for it and think there is something wrong with them or they aren doing it right, when in fact it just not something that works for them. The G spot does not provide any kind of special orgasm that can happen other ways. Indeed there is only one, universal type of female orgasm that can be arrived at in many different ways. The vast majority of women get the most pleasure from a combination of vaginal penetration and clitoral stimulation at the same time.

Very sorry to hear about this. As other commenters have said, I would highly, highly suggest getting in touch with BC Ambulance and Westshore RCMP. Westshore is the Public Safety Answering Point (Meaning they are the initial point of contact when answering 911, they ask Police, Ambulance or Fire? And do the transfer). It sounds like the transfer was not performed correctly. When these things happen, the services involved need to know ASAP, if they aren informed about the problems, then how are they going to fix them to ensure this doesn happen again?
Jess and I managed to find the local people's market (that's what I always call those street side markets that sell kid's underwear, buckets, bootleg CDs, etc.).

All that matters is appearance and that leads to countless contradictions in Korea. It doesn matter if you go for drinks with escorts at the thousands of dirty s on the reg, because that guys time and it behind closed doors. But when it comes to the youth, THEY MUST BE PROTECTED. From room salons, hotel owners, talking bars, to the people that own the commercial space those businesses are in; all of them have a voice in government and all of them get an advantage from pornography being slightly difficult/frustrating to get. So they use religion/saving youth as a pedestal to espouse censorship of internet pornography as a smokescreen to make sure their sorce of income isn affected. They also use the concept of money leaving the peninsula from overseas paysites as a secondary arguement because whether it is conservative or liberal the Korean gov never ever wants to see money leaving the country that isn taxed in some way.

Then Mace Windu and Jango confront each other. The battle that Boba watches should be one in which his all powerful father slays a great Jedi. Boba smiles expectantly. Mace runs at Jango, deflecting Jango shots and with a swiftness that Boba sees only in a purple blur, Jango head flies from his shoulders and his helmet clatters on the ground. The body of Boba father falls lifeless. The fight that should have been a certain victory was a crushing defeat. The master Jedi destroyed Jango with unnerving ease. Boba, too, is destroyed by the knowledge that his father is not as powerful as Boba had assumed. This weight on Boba mind is compounded by the fact that Boba understands he is now alone in the galaxy.

Just to be clear, because this is a topic I could stand to have a better grasp of, the reason Walmart can use point of sale data in the same way is that they don have access to, say, Costco practices on the same level, because they don themselves sell Costco goods for them; those two supermarkets are directly competing sale points, not a hub for multiple sellers one tier above to congregate.

The rituals and traditions of French horse racing have endured, but today the industry faces very modern threats: an aging bettor profile, a growing contingent of potentially untapped online gamers and gamblers, and competition from new horse race betting operators who contest PMU support from the French government. These challenges, hastened along by the loss of monopoly status for online betting in France in 2010, became a catalyst for PMU to modernize its commercial approach strategically and promote the globalization of the French horse racing industry. As the largest pari mutual betting operator in Europe and the second largest in the world, PMU responded proactively and turned these challenges into opportunities to become better prepared for the globalized economy.
I don't need to google it. I know the risks from peer reviewed studies and have heard the complaints of patients who have experienced adverse effects in person. Your assertion that there is "almost never any need" for MRI contrast is absurd; it is essential for early detection of cancer and monitoring multiple sclerosis. The benefits to those patients affected by (or suspected of having) those diseases far outweigh the risks observed in a few dozen hypochondriacs like Chuck Norris' wife.

Taking into consideration all these stats, you can calculate and decide your move, before you place a bet. So, in one sense of the word, a poker calculator acts as a personal coach.

The ESPN Poker Club Wooden 4 Deck Dealer Shoe has this heavy duty roller that allows for fast consistent action.

After we have calmed down a bit (well I mean like 3 or 4 of us, the others either fell unconscious or still sobbing uncontrollably), we tried to see our monitor screens again, there was a black person in the game, and we also fell unconscious.
To quickly substantiate this, think of the genuine goodwill that must exist between you and your closest friends. I can try a simple thought experiment: if you could, say, anonymously sacrifice a little well being on your part to grant them their biggest dreams, I posit that you do it, even if they never know it was you.

Still, there's something in the human psyche that loves to take a chance. It's one of the traits that sets our minds apart from the artificial minds of machines.

To be honest, most the books I read are centered on geopolitics and environmental policy as its the sector I looking to integrate, so most "pure" environmental literature I tend to go through are papers.

Am I the only one who thinks the floor got the string bet ruling completely wrong? If there ruling is correct, then this definately allows for exploits. For instance, if I have a stack of large denomination chips, I grab the whole stack, place it past the (invisible) betting line, and without letting go of the stack I can then decide how many chips I want to let go of, and how many chips I want to take back.

I didn't write their essays or even ready them just asked them to write them and have them the 2 pager I wrote up about me. I've heard some applicants will just write their own essays and ask people to submit, but they both were very willing to write them so it wasn't an issue for me.

By the time I contacted them they already taken action. The organisers were furious at the deception. In the blog I listed UM risks to children, which included cult leader, Serge Benhayon inappropriate behaviour with children, his hazardous esoteric diet, his perverse promotion of circumcision to control male sexual urges, his advocating of corporal punishment, his diseased attitudes to the female body and sex, his misogynist condemnation of women pursuit of equal rights and participation in sport, his questionable hands on healing practices, and his offensive, anti social, anti education and anti family Unified Truth teachings.. 
The new Arizona law generally known as SB 1070 is considered the strictest anti immigrant legislation in the country and is explicitly intended to drive undocumented immigrants out of the state. One reason it has instigated a boycott is because to a whole lot of people, myself included, it appears to not only invite but require the police to engage in racial profiling. Before we had a chance to fully get our heads around the implications of either 1070 or of the subsequent boycott, our governor signed HB 2281, which is intended to eliminate any Ethnic Studies classes from public and charter schools in Arizona..

The hard truth is, it really hasn been until the last several years that many states had even begun licensing massage therapists. Actually, there are still a handful of states that are unregulated. Because of this, for decades in many places there hadn been any standards in place to show any level of education or competency for someone to call themselves a massage therapist. Some of those practitioners have been grandfathered in as licensing has been enacted (and sadly, some are teaching this misinformation as well.) It going to take time, but there are MANY of us that take our education and practices quite seriously, and want to raise the standards so that dribble like this will one day go away.

Well, first off as a bloke, of course there is the penis himself But not just the penis, often the centre of attention, the testicles can be left dangling and of course beyond the testicles (wow, a moovie name; Beyond Testicle) ?We have that nice little area between the ends of the scrotum and anus all those areas are rather nice To the Penis itself, of course I'm sure we all know the 'tip' of the penis is most sensitive as it has a greater number of nerve endings. I do not know how much discourse we need on the penis as we have probably covered a fair bit of that. Talking of 'how much' etc., etc., some people can be a little over entheustic when it comes to exactly how far the foreskin should or hsould not move back from the 'head' of the Penis. now. moving on As I may have mentioed I find nipples very eroginious zones and moving on. to the anus well. lettuce just say that some people do find that area eroginus whilst others do not The weekend? looking foward to it? me?

The cross examination was littered with objections from both sides of the court room, especially when McCauley started reading verbatim from the affidavit.

Under the GOP it was the hastert rule. named after a famous republican pedophile. It says nothing gets added and nothing gets voted on, unless it has the support of the "majority of the majority party". normal rules says "majority of the house". SO under dems, all the republicans and a handful of dems, could force an issue to be voted on. but under republicans, it could be all the dems, and 49 of the gop and it wouldnt get a vote, because it needs 51% of the gop.
Explanation of white privilege that resonated with me was that we playing the game of Life on easy mode. That doesn mean that it isn challenging or that you are going to automatically win or have anything handed to you. You will have to fight for everything you get and you will feel satisfied if you are successful at the game. But, everyone else (non cis white males) are playing on hard mode. It takes more effort to achieve the same result, and there are more obstacles to overcome along the way. You both have to master the boss fights, but they came into the room at half health, so to speak. Analogy helped me understand that it wasn an attack (necessarily) when someone spoke about my privilege.

My experience over the last 5+ years in business is that there are people who want to own their own business but not willing to put the work into it, so all they do is talk about it. There are some who attempt it but realize they are in over their heads and bail. Sometimes the first go at a business is a loss and they give up. 
That means, 5% of the time, Gary, with his GTO strategy, wins 1BB. That a win rate of 5BB/100 (not bad). Notice if Nick now never forgets to check, then both players break even, as they will always check pre flop, and always check on the flop turn or river.

If he was smart then we wouldn't be having the scandals we are having right now. So maybe he's actually just scrambling for whatever is left on the carcass before being ripped away by the powers that be.

Time shifting and rampant commercial avoidance have wreaked havoc on the hoary ad supported TV model, and while C3 and the enhanced C7 metric have helped a handful of already high rated shows win back a good deal of impressions that would otherwise be lost to the predations of the DVR, the currency hasn't had much of an impact on the business as a whole. And as ad skipping continues to accelerate, what was originally designed as a stopgap measure is proving no more efficient than holding up a tiny sign that reads "Eep!" right before gravity sends the cartoon coyote careening to the canyon floor..
