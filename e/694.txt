And Days Gone looks boring and uninspired but God forbid anyone criticizes Sony. Xbox has its faults, yes, but my favorite thing about the Xbox community and the reason that I prefer my Xbox over my PlayStation is because they are just as quick to criticize Microsoft as they are to praise them but that kind of attitude is unheard of in the PlayStation community. Yes Xbox is lacking in exclusives this gen but it more than makes up for it with the services they have introduced and continue to support as well as the transparency they have with the community and the willingness to make gaming more accessible for everyone no matter where or how you play. Xbox branching out to Nintendo should be seen as a good thing for everyone but instead the PlayStation audience sees it as a bad thing and a sign of weakness. Just remember that even though PlayStation is on top now it doesn mean they will be forever, this kind of hubris attitude is what caused Sony to fail with the PS3 and it starting to seem that they haven learned their lesson at all. Also as an aside, if you honestly think Crackdown 3 looks like a 360 game, you either haven played it or have a terrible memory.

My nicknameWell, my nickname is ndr. ndr is one of my nicknames anyway. It is the one my friends and some1of my relatives know. ndr comes from "And", one of the most commonly used words in English and also is a combination of various letters gleaned from my first and surnames. I'm left handed and if you consider a left handed android, it wouldn't have painful diodes so take them out. Contemplate the meaning of the ancient celtic word ndr as a description of me. I also perversely like words that are hard for native English speakers to pronounce. I was actually given the nickname by a Gaelic speaking relative. Thus, a number of reasons for my nickname. To pronounce it, say "And" using a longish "a" sound such as in "car" mixed slightly with the "e" sound in "hen" and then add a slightly rolled "rrrrr" at the end, but no ending "uh" if you don't mind!

I never actually met anyone in person I had something like this sort of in common with. When my mom married my step dad he owned this fixer upper house in an upscale neighborhood, but he never ended up fixing it up.

Like there was these big holes in the kitchen, hallway, and other places that went to the basement, and I fell in several times, like legs waving around in the basement while my torso was still on the ground floor of the house and I had to pull myself out. Plus, my step dad was a low level hoarder so the house was packed with junk and piles of junk and the kitchen in general was just always a mess and everything was cluttered, so it wasnt always easy to avoid these holes. In the winter we didn have heat bc too much of it escaped. And he had a pretty good job, and always kept the exterior of the house looking nice so our neighbors wouldn know.

And although shifting between standing and sitting was effortless   flick a switch one way to go up, the other to go down   deciding on the right height for each position took a bit of practice.

Respect your opponents; meaning wait for your turn. You may have the winning hand with all aces in tow but try to stop yourself from laying the cards and jumping on tables or even gloating.

Consider applying for a parking permit renewal. Haringey's charging structure now mirrors the DVLA structure on CO2. As far as I can tell the one additional item of information LBH needs to charge me for the next year is that my car is rated at 111 grams per kilometre. At the moment they know it is between 100 and 150. But in addition to this I must also supply the log book and my driving licence, which contain infrmation they already know. I know they know because they tell me all this information when I enter my applicant ID. Going through this again merely occupies my time and makes work for Franz.

In other words, before switching consoles, just quit out of the game you been playing and let the Xbox sit on the dashboard for a few minutes (saves get uploaded only when the game is shut down pretty sure). If you then shut down your (old) Xbox completely, wait a couple minutes before unplugging it because it possible that it still uploading stuff or even downloading a pending system update. On the original One, this means waiting until the light on the PSU turns from white to orange. Then it should be 100% smooth sailing when you connect your new console. Do keep in mind though that every few months or so, syncing saves sometimes is spotty due to server shittiness on MS part, but this gets resolved super fast usually so if that happens (syncing failed or some such message), just retry until it works. But this is very rare, as I said.

I have a question about the "naturality" of some morphological features I was thinking about adding to an a priori lang. Basically, the idea is to alter the inflection of a noun depending on the type of clause it is placed in. At the most basic level that would involve marking nouns, adjectives and verbs that are part of a subclause. So say  X was a suffix denoting that a verb or noun was part of a subclause, that would give us something like "He said he X liked X me X". At first this might look similar to a subjunctive, but firstly I explicitly don want it to be about verbal mood, but purely about syntactic position; secondly this would extend to marking other word types such as nouns and adjectives; so does anything like this occur in natlangs, and (even if not) what would be some fitting terminology for such a phenomenon? Instinctively I might have called it a "subordinating mode" or something like that, or based on the term "complementizer", something like "complementized mode".

I've had more shots than I can remember go bad for me. For some reason, moving up from 100NL to 200NL was the worst run I ever had with shots during my poker career. It must have taken me 10 different attempts before finally being able to move up for good.

You'll join the smaller tables again and feel like the money just isn't enough to get your blood stirring. Don't worry; that feeling will go away soon enough. Don't let it keep you from making the right choice.
Yeah, it the most generic fantasy setting that I ever seen. Carbon copy of Tolkien with some of that post GoT edge.

You don need to study openings to play well, but it gets harder and harder to win in competitive chess if you don Openings are like. songs to a musician. If you a very good musician, you can pick up an instrument and probably improvise a whole song from start to finish with very little forethought. It impressive, but also difficult to guarantee every improvisation is going to sound good every time you play. Wouldn it be much easier to take some time when you not under pressure and on stage performing to learn a repertoire of songs that you know are going to sound good before you even start playing? That way you could guarantee that every time you step on stage you going to play something that sounds good, and you can just improvise a little solo here and there.

Bill ClintonBill and Hillary in 1999Getty Images"The couple sometimes got into pitched battles, shocking the staff with their vicious cursing, and sometimes they went through periods of stoney silence," writes Brower.Florist Ronn Payne recalls seeing two butlers listening through the door to a "vicious" argument in the West Sitting Hall."All of a sudden, he heard the first lady bellow, 'goddamn bastard!' at the president   and then he heard someone throw a heavy object across the room.While the public didn't learn of Clinton's affair until January 1998, staffers at the White House had been watching it happen since 1995."The butlers saw the president and Lewinsky in the family movie theater, and the two of them were seen together so frequently that the workers started letting one another know when they'd had a Lewinsky sighting," Brower writes.The president paid for his indiscretions not just publicly, but at home as well."For three or four months in 1998," Brower writes, "the president slept on a sofa in a private study attached to their bedroom on the second floor.

The Play: Deal seven cards to each player. Each player then passes three cards to the player on his left, then two and then one. Each player then trashes two cards and puts the remaining five cards in the order he would like to see them played. Play and betting are then usual as each player reveals one card simultaneously. This game can get exceedingly expensive and is even better when played as a hi lo game.
So as long as we don develop robots to make autonomous kill decisions of people, foreign powers will not? Lets say America only creates robots that autonomously kill drones.

Most chassis ground leads, [a lead connected to the motor frame] are not brought out with the power leads, to avoid confusion] normally the chassis ground is connected to a screw or through bolt, often colored green on the head of the bolt, and away from the terminal block or if in the terminal block positioned in such a manner it does not seem to fall into any possible "pattern" of the power leads. Five lead motors [if ALL ARE WINDING LEADS] are fairly rare and generally special, for example most single phase would be two, three, four, or six, many are four power with one chassis ground.

I would argue that it was backwards. The royal family were lunatics by the time the japanese annexed the country. Most of the people were living as they did 5 centuries before. Japan had been in an industrial revolution since the meiji period and the destruction of the shogunate. As for whether or not korea wouldve been split up, i would argue that it probably would have. Those in the north, the gogyro, had no love of those in the south, the baekja and silla, since tje two in the south had hooked up with the chinese to destroy their kingdom and unify the penninsula. Living here as long as i have, i know that asians hold grudges for a LONG time. This argument actually reminds me of that scene in life of brian where one says "what have the romans ever done for us?!" To which they list off a number of improvements the romans brought. Did the japanese do some awful things during the time between the annexation and the end of ww2? Most certainly. Were koreans innocent victims for the entire period? Id argue no. Many of the heads of industry here at the end of the war had been collaborating with the japanese the entire time. Ive seen enough pimps around high schools in this country today to know that many of the comfort women might not have had to be kidnapped and hauled off as is claimed. They couldve merely been naive girls who believed some officer promises of a better life. But persuing these lines of investigation into recent korean history will get your tenure revoked and banned from academia here.

When Gonzaga announced in October that Tillie had surgery to repair a stress fracture in his right ankle, the release noted an approximate recovery time of eight weeks.

But isn that a question of intent? I would agree that getting ultra rich may desensitize someone or put distance between them and the average guy (I think it would largely depend on who they are, how they amassed the wealth, and how they are living). Bill Gates and other billionaires (although not many) are certainly capable of leading progressive movements. But making tons of money in and of itself is not sufficient evidence to despise someone or vote against them in my opinion.

How did we land ourselves in this mess? For one thing, as a church, we are really good at saying "well, he or she did her best. It good enough for the Lord, so it good enough for us." That may cut it with a questionable Sunday School lesson or sacrament meeting talk, but think about music for a moment. The singing of the hymns in sacrament meeting is the one active, outward worship experience the entire ward has together at the same time. (Yes, we all take the sacrament together, but that an inward experience.) As you all said above me, it has the power to make or break a person Sunday experience.

Love this. The topic of male sexual assault/rape/abuse/molestation/harassment/coercion has consistently been the trickiest on for me to teach about (I a sexual education specialist). Every single year when we get to this unit and I bring up male victims, I get met with snickering (from students of all genders and sexual orientations). There has yet to be a year when I haven had to pause the class and have a serious discussion about how males can be victims too. It also always leads to a discussion on social norms and how so many females view it as being okay to force themselves onto men when the men initially turn down their sexual advances. Society is seriously fucked up when it comes to this stuff.

The passivity goes back to Sam Adams. The encampments got much worse after he protected the Occupy protests.

An anti gay rights encampment, for example, that claimed a free speech basis for living and pooping in public parks? Methinks not. Worst mayor ever.

I remember that the very busy and gifted Camille Flammarion published views of the Earth like these in his Astronomie Populaire in 1880, though the images that follow were published several years earlier in the SA. Extraterrestrial landscapes are a leap of faith based on available observations, and no doubt that the readers of the late 19th century seeing these images for the first time would have been transported by their ingenuity and depth of understanding i n representing the Earth as just another bit in the sky when it is seen from other locations.

Oh man. You gotta find the guy that gets off on watching you orgasm. Some guys get off because it feels physically good to have his genitals touched, some get off on mental fantasies, and then there the ones who get off because their woman is getting off.

Lastly, while I think if your opponent gets to the river with his exact hand, it one of his best bluffs he can lead/call the flop with, anyone limp/calling J8o and lead/calling middle pair is someone I wouldn trust to tie their own shoes unsupervised, much less would I stew about poker decisions they making.

Morgan Brashear, a home care scientist with Procter Gamble, notes in an email that people constantly deal with both internal and external pressures related to cleanliness. "From the internal point of view, when your house is dirty, or your space is cluttered or messy you feel chaotic internally. You don't feel like you have a handle on things," she explains.

Externally speaking, we stress ourselves out about how others will view our space, and fear that they'll pass judgement on our hygiene and housekeeping skills. So, not only are we our own harshest critics, we think everyone else is, too.

Having a colicky baby is an extreme test in resilience and mental strength. Our first was colicky and it was such a tough time that we heavily debated being one and done. So I understand where you at right now. I know it little consolation when you in the middle of it, but honestly, having a colicky baby is something you just need to survive. It will get better, but it going to be a rough ride. We had to make a lot of adjustments in the first year. We didn go out, get together with friends, or plan to do anything after work. My husband cooked very simple meals and served them to me in cut up bites so I could hold our crying baby and eat at the same time. We functioned on less than 4 5 hours of sleep for months.

That a much more nuanced argument since soy and other plant based protein sources, contrary to popular vegan belief, are not "complete sources of protein" (meat is), as they lack two of the nine amino acids, specifically methionine and lysine. So soy alone would not suffice, and more sources of plant protein would need to be consumed to make up for the lack of amino acids one finds in protein rich meat. 
The criticism about Schneiderlin passing and transition to attack are fair but I think not too worrisome. Historically Morgan is a better passer than Gana or Davies and I think how he faded in the second half was largely just down to fatigue. As for the the transitioning to attack i don want to beat him up to much on that simply because i don think that his job as a DM.

Poker is a game of incomplete information. It only works because no one knows what anyone else has, and all of poker's skills are directed toward either divining what others have based upon their actions, and hiding what you are doing based upon your own. Erego, don't give information for free.

A single workout for the entire gym population is not the crux of CF. The crux of CF is it's constantly varied methodology, and the desire to specialize in nothing but be decent at everything. I'm not attacking General CF methodology, not here.

System we have now of poor and working class students taking on ridiculous amounts of debt to get an education and then in half of the cases being forced to drop out of school before they even finished their degree while upper class students get degrees from elite institutions at the cost of $50,000 a year, graduating with little or no debt and all the connections they ever need, is the opposite of democracy. Is an aristocracy  a way of passing wealth  economic, educational, and social  from one generation to the next while the vast majority of us are shut out. Education should be affordable to anyone who qualifies and should not require a lifetime of debt.

We are only going to follow the same trend of doing more, with less.
Beginning this October, Fox on Friday nights will air "SmackDown Live," a two hour WWE wrestling showcase designed to attract a more apple cheeked cohort of male viewers. Fox's current Friday night lineup scares up an audience with a median age just shy of 57 rather creaky given that any viewer who's reached the half century mark is wholly invisible to the network's advertisers. Wrasslin' should bring those numbers down into the more mature end of the millennial spectrum.
Also, in Wespe, the single "s" is pronounced like an English "s", not like an English "z". This is because the "s" is at the end of a syllable. The same goes for the words des, was, das, deshalb (which should be parsed des halb, not desh alb), and so on. When an "s" begins a syllable (singen, lesen, so), it is pronounced like the English "z"; when it ends a syllable, it is pronounced like the English "s".

It actually, effectively, 1% for each suited hand. So odds would be 0 to 5% depending on how many of the five players hold suited hands or not. I say there are a definitely about 2 3 of them holding suited hands on an average in this spot so real world chance is probably 2 3%.
But not all of the waste can be used in that process, so a lot of it has to be dealt with in other ways. Mostly it will be incinerated or dumped in landfills and rivers. China wants other countries to deal with the non useful waste, so they import an intermediate result of processing the waste instead: Flakes and pellets.

We are what we are and if we need an Ag school to provide our future farmers an education I rather have that than worry about Academic Rankings but really if we didn have that we probably be a lot higher. I imagine that weighs us down quite a bit. We have a really competitive engineering school, a top Vet school in the world not just the US, and a lot of our business programs and design programs are good. Our Agriculture stuff is good too but I imagine academically that weighs us down.

Let 'Em Ride Poker plays out much like Hold 'Em Poker. The ball player is dealt five cards, a pair of that happen to be face down. After looking at the initial three cards, you can improve their bet.

One possibility is taking matters into your own hands and inserting his penis into your anus, instead of your vagina, in the woman on top position. If you decide to do this, I highly recommend inserting a large butt plug (since you say he big) several hours before you expect to have sex.

The problem with PLO is how confusing the betting is for people. The pot limit aspect of it forces a lot of additional math just to get the bet sizes right.

First off, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, which means that it is generally illegal at the federal level and is illegal in all 50 states.

Beyond that, there are methods to ensuring a greater degree of success at a poker table that can be accomplished on the Internet that include collusion and other behaviors that would get a person thrown out of (if not arrested in) a genuine casino, but that are entirely undetectable through an on line casino.

You don't you can't you shouldn't And that said. In the old days, there were many ways of cheating at cards, including fixed decks, cold decks, shiners, strippers, mechanical devices and a variety of dealing and slight of hand tricks. The simplest way is for your partner to simply and covertly inform you of the contents of their hand, and this small amount of information can sway the odds enough to make a difference. Whole teams may be assigned to this sort of project, as well as various kinds of electronic surveillance devices. This form of cheating is very hard for the house to detect, and harder still for individual players. Other Members say there are No Cheats (but there are tricks). .

Dropping in a less contested area near a very contested area is a proven strategy that can help struggling players learn the game and helps them also just get more skilled at aiming in a somewhat safer environment (3rd partying is safer than engaging a fresh team). I gained map control over the hot zone and the surrounding areas using this strategy to defeat vastly superior (in skill) teams to my team several times. Doesn always work, but when it does it takes out one of the likely much higher skilled squads (they often drop hot) and gives you good gear to start with.

Two good paying slots are never arranged next to one another. Another thing that you must keep in mind is that you must never stick to only one slot machine. If one machine has produced a high payout, it is time you go for another slot because the same machine may make you a loser.

Unemployment risk management can include an emergency fund whether cash or an unused low interest rate line of credit. A retirement plan should probably also be based upon an early retirement, just in case a career is cut short due to unforeseen circumstances.

Another important concept is having counterfeit protection. For example, let's look at two hands, one with A 2 3 5 and one with A 2 Q K. If the flop comes 4 6 7, both players have the best possible low hand. You might raise the bet here, thinking you have a good shot at the low hand. However, if an A or 2 falls on the turn or river, the hand with A 2 Q K no longer has the best possible low while the other hand still does. Remember, you have to use two cards from your starting hand. If you have to throw out your A or 2 because you made a pair on the turn or river (and consequently no longer have the lowest hand), you would have to play your K or Q (making your low hand very weak).

When you get into the more rarefied air of eights to aces, you may start losing perspective and putting up more money. "Small pairs have a less ambiguous value," Siler says. (See more about casinos.). 
Eh. It sort of depends on a lot of factors, the type of facility, why you are there, etc. For one thing only if you are an immediate danger to yourself can they keep you involuntarily in many states. I bet Missouri is one of them. Source: I had several friends on involuntary hold for suicide attempts. In our state they only keep you 72 hours unless there is reason to believe you are actually going to commit suicide immediately or request to stay. No depression and the fact that you just tried isn enough. You can easily say "I feel better, I want to go home" and they let you go. I don think cutting is enough, one of my friends was doing so.

There is ample evidence that, in the hands of real people, the shorter driver might very well hit the ball, not just with more accuracy, but more distance as well. For every quarter inch you miss the "sweet spot" on your driver, you loose about five yards in distance. Miss it by a half an inch, you loose about 10 yards, by an inch 20 yards and so on.

I learned this from the owner I worked for. He said there is no benefit to a landlord to undercut himself just because someone pays their rent early. Why would he do that? He wants the max rent he can get for 12 months. 
But another important point is that subversion is usually used before raw force. Socialists and working class elected officials are often off by high salaries and comfortable positions. Why would such an official want to challenge their own privileged position in that case? Also, the media hegemony limits ideas that challenge the system its owners rely on. But if it has to, the ruling class will defend its own personal interest with violence. If the majority of people want to overthrow a government, then the police will be expected to stop such a movement, even if it has a huge popular mandate.

With that not being the case, the Mythic Editions make even less sense. Why did they print them in the two Ravnica sets?

There is a saying in the IT supply chain: where there is mystery, there is margin. For buyers, the mystery exists at two levels with the evolving technology itself, and with IT supply chain agreements and practices. OEMs control much of the pricing (and a fair amount of related margin), while resellers obtain income from markups that vary based on deal registration programs and their partner status with the OEM. Distributors, who are the intermediaries between OEMs and resellers, take their cut when the resellers procure the products used in a solution. In the end, there are three levels of markup on most IT quotations that cross a buyer desk.
