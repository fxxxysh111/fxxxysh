In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the bond an option markets were dominated by traders who had learned their craft by experience. They believed that there experience and intuition for trading were a renewable edge; this is, that they could make money just as they always had by continuing to trade as they always had. By the mid 1990s, a revolution in trading had occurred; the old school grizzled traders had been replaced by a new breed of quantitative analysts, applying mathematics to the "art" of trading and making of it a science. Similarly in poker, for decades, the highest level of pokers have been dominated by players who have learned the game by playing it, "road gamblers" who have cultivated intuition for the game and are adept at reading other players' hands from betting patterns and physical tells. Over the last five to ten years, a whole new breed has risen to prominence within the poker community. Applying the tools of computer science and mathematics to poker and sharing the information across the Internet, these players have challenged many of the assumptions that underlie traditional approaches to the game. One of the most important features of this new approach is a reliance on quantitative analysis and the application of mathematics to the game. The intent of this book is to provide an introduction to quantitative techniques as applied to poker and to a branch of mathematics that is particularly applicable to poker, game theory. There are mathematical techniques that can be applied for poker that are difficult and complex.

In the coming weeks we'll be posting a poll about ideas we've been bouncing around, and how our users would like to see certain things implemented. We are also looking at possibly separating our rules into a new format. They will be the subs boundaries. Safe boundaries with good community will be something we'll be exploring to combat the echo chamber that some posts very quickly become. We are also considering separating posting and commenting boundaries in an effort to make them both easier to understand from your viewpoint, and easier to implement to a level that will take understanding, communication, and cooperation to reach a spot we can all feel comfortable with. Our goal is NOT to create the next generation of JustNo's. cringe

So why does anyone get into it in the first place? Speaking only for myself, it started off as curiosity since I kept hearing about how good the show was suppose to be. But I think a lot of it also came from it feeling like a forbidden fruit to me, in a sense. It a show clearly aimed at little girls, and here I was, a man in his mid twenties at the time, enjoying it. I felt like I was part of this secret underground society of people that somehow "got" the show, that I was special for seeing the value in it when no one else could or would. Add in the fact that I was also down on my luck and living with my parents at the time, so I guess there was also that added thrill of getting caught watching it. But eventually I found my footing and was able to live on my own, and I could finally watch the show without feeling like a criminal, and I think that probably when I noticed a marked drop in how much I cared about the show. And the novelty of it also wore off some and I could start being honest with myself about how good it actually was. Similar to how you think a new game is the absolute best when it comes out and it does everything right, then you get bored with it and suddenly notice all of the things it does completely wrong. So I guess you could say I finally outgrew the show. I don regret watching it, time you spent being entertained is hardly time wasted. But I definitely long past the grip of the pony fever.

Although duelists rarely went to trial for their crime, when they did, many would proudly admit to what they did, and count on the jury acquitting them   nullification   because they had conducted themselves honorably. Even judges were known to at times opine to the jury that they believed the duel had been fair and properly conducted, even though illegal. I would direct you to MacNamara speech in court which I touched on here for an excellent example of this.

I've still got my 1960 Penguin translation of Lorca's selected poems, with the original Spanish version taking pride of place on the page with the English translation relegated to mere footnotes. In 1971, when I bought it, I think it was "cool" to read Lorca. Now, confronted by a book of his prose musings on his home country, originally published there in 1918, I am overwhelmed by the word pictures he paints, accompanied by Julian Bell's gentlemanly "Englishman abroad" drawings.
If you have the money to waste, go for it. The point of layering it is this: the ramp will skate faster when you are riding with the grain and slower when you are riding across the grain.

Other people have spoken well to the relationship aspect. Regarding the matter of your appearance, I would strongly suspect that the problem is that you are TOO attractive for controlling parents. There is a very large cohort of assholes out there that like to assume that beautiful women are Jezebels and sinners. It doesn matter if you have been a pious church camp girl your entire life sprout a pair of well shaped boobs, or just a very pretty face, and you are a sinner destined for hell, not marriage. I sure they want a "pretty" girl for their boy, but not some Jezebel of course, which actually means no one non imaginary qualifies, which means they get to keep him forever, which is exactly what controlling parents want. Or maybe its a racist thing. I don know. But I know controlling parents, and its definitely NOT because you not pretty enough, it likely the opposite. Keep being your sweet lovely self and don invite this poison into your life.

For someone who has grown up in the modern world, the city of Rome, even after its redevelopment by Augustus, was not a particularly pleasant place. I actually posit that the gladiatorial contests would be one of the most recognizable   and even accepted   things in modern society. There were rules, there was a referee, and, while certainly a blood sport, a gladiatorial contest was more about fighters coming out on top, rather than the loser actually dying (which was reasonably rare   current estimates are that 80 90% of losers in any of these contests went on to fight again). The arenas were large, with some reserved seating, awnings to protect the audience from the sun, raucous fans, and vendors selling overpriced food. Yeah that part isn terrifically civilized.

First of all, it undoubtedly more than 0.5s of healing in many cases. Second of all, it every time Mercy uses Valk, so that adds up. And third, the higher the elo, the more "little things" matter. Team fights absolutely can be lost by a margin of 25 HP, especially if that means the difference between using or losing a teammate Ult during that fight (for example, Genji uses Dragonblade, which gets him focused, so Mercy pops Valk to heal him through it, but he dies during the 1 second of healing he missed, because not only did the beam break, but he now dashing around like a mad man and couldn be re targetted immediately as he flies back and forth across his teammates).

Again, I accept that your conclusion is logically derived from the premise that a person is morally obligated to contribute the greatest good to society that they feasibly can, but that premise seems very irrational. It sets a standard of baseline morality at the greatest possible sacrifice one can make and judges moral failing by the extent they fail to give, rather than the actual difference a person makes..

When Richard Nixon was in his late teens, he worked at a carnival in Prescott, Arizona, running a less than legal gambling game called , where participants could pay to spin a wheel for real cash prizes. But where most folks grow out of that kind of teenage mischief once they reach adulthood, Nixon would ride his love of illicit gambling right to the Oval Office. Either way, Nixon was clearly already in the habit of doing whatever the hell he wanted and didn't give one whistling dolphin anus what anyone else thought.

In one study, for example, Watson and a colleague followed 18 Japanese college students over a three month period in 1980, assessing their daily moods and correlating the ratings with weather summaries. To the researchers' surprise, their analyses of the data all demonstrated that the students' mood was unrelated to the weather. Watson subsequently gathered data from 478 college students in Texas during various periods during the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s, which he again compared to weather records.

Whenever /u/GallowBoob posts something   regardless of where he does it   quite a few people descend to make unfounded accusations about him. Many of these spurious claims could utterly ruin a person's life if they were taken seriously, and the vast majority of them go against one rule or another in the subreddits where they take place. Then, when the comments get removed, the users who posted them get up in arms about it, throwing out accusations that the moderators are somehow being threatened or bribed to side with their sworn enemy.

If some Korean haters shout out "kill josenjing", some fuss would be made but that won be enough to make whole nation to have grudge against the other. I believe that Japanese culture is awesome and Korea can be a good friend of Japan in various aspect but it can be done while Japanese politicians are keep provoking.

I recognize there are very few studies about this, and the connection between dopamine and ADHD is still considered controversial. I interested why you received 10 days of IV NAD.

As a former middle school teacher, I hated hearing from certain students that their parents didn care, have any consequences, or practically rewarded them for their bad behavior in class. So I think it great that you backing up the school with a reasonable consequence at home. Tech time out and early bedtime for a week seems appropriate vs if you were grounding him for a month. IMO your son will more vividly remember getting in extra trouble at home vs the other kids whose parents think it solely the school responsibility to deal with it. I also talk with him about using common sense and making good decisions, though.

Quand on voit les Juifs disperss sur la terre, selon la parole de Dieu, on est surpris sans doute : mais pour tre frapp d'un tonnement surnaturel, il faut les retrouver  Jrusalem ; il faut voir ces lgitimes matres de la Jude esclaves et trangers dans leur propre pays ; il faut les voir attendant, sous toutes les oppressions, un roi qui doit les dlivrer. Ecrass par la Croix qui les condamne, et qui est plante sur leurs ttes, cachs prs du Temple dont il ne reste pas pierre sur pierre, ils demeurent dans leur dplorable aveuglement. Les Perses, les Grecs, les Romains ont disparu de la terre ; et un petit peuple, dont l'origine prcda celle de ces grands peuples, existe encore sans mlange dans les dcombres de sa patrie. Si quelque chose, parmi les nations, porte le caractre du miracle, nous pensons que ce caractre est ici. Et qu'y a t il de plus merveilleux, mme aux yeux du philosophe, que cette rencontre de l'antique et de la nouvelle Jrusalem au pied du Calvaire : la premire s'affligeant  l'aspect du spulcre de Jsus Christ ressuscit ; la seconde se consolant auprs du seul tombeau qui n'aura rien  rendre  la fin des sicles !

Many strata council and property managers often assure their owners and clients that several bids on a project will be sought and the best bid will be accepted. hHwever, multiple bids alone will not assure success or best value. Dear Tony: Our strata owners recently approved $1.8 million from our contingency fund on elevator upgrades, deck and balcony repairs and the replacement of our boilers. At our general meeting, an owner questioned the council on how the funds would be spent and how the council would ensure we obtained the best prices for the best values and not leave our strata corporation in a disaster over failed contracts.

Incorrect.
