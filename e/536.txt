Slow play when you have a monster hand like a straight flush. This is a case where you don't want to bet big and push out people with marginal hands. You want them to think they have the best hand and bet big or at least to bluff at the pot because they don't think you have anything..

Twist is that you can fight your way out of it, so unless you had one of the big guys on your team your best bet was to double up and carry whoever you found back to the fire. If you didn want to fight though it was just hide and seek with other people yelling and getting dragged down a hill.

Although this book was first published in 2006, all of it's content is still applicable today in 2013, which is when I first decided to read it. All of the math content in this book is a must know if you want to crush poker. I have read over 20 poker books and watched over 100 poker training videos. I have a degree in Computer Engineering and math is my strong point   THIS WAS A TOUGH BOOK TO READ! The reason it was tough was because of all the math proofs. If you've ever taken a college calculus course, usually your professor will go over the proofs in class, step by step, and you can follow along and ask questions and the final result makes sense. Reading this book is like picking up a calculus book and trying to learn it on your own. If you are like me and have trouble following along with the proofs, then you may just want to skip to the results in some of the chapters. Chapters 10 through 21 are the meat of this book, and the basis for Game Theory in Poker, which is the 1 reason I bought this book. 5 Stars for Content, 3 Stars for readability.

Sorry, but not so sure your just not obsessed with he gilded age. Not sure we are there, but giving you the benefit of the doubt that you are legitimately concerned with pay inequality, what do you propose as the solution. I saw a post about someone complaining about the rent in NY being 2400 for a efficiency apartment. That to me seems to be a supply and demand problem more than a pay problem. If that be the case 15.00 an hour isn't going to fix the issue. As for unions, yes they had a purpose in the past. We now have regulations that protect employees more so than what we had in the past. My own experience is that I am making more money that what I ever did at a union position. Beware of who you trust, as Union reps have their own agenda as much as employers do.

That said, the biggest reason why Greece looms so large isn that they were unique. They were better than most, but the biggest reason we think of them is that our culture is heavily based on Greek history. The Renaissance was, in intellectual terms, Europe spending a couple centuries re learning all the old Greek and Roman stuff that had been forgotten in the dark ages. That led to a strong fanboy culture, and that affinity and deep study explains why Greek and Latin are still serious topics of study and widely used in science and law, when nobody but a specialist cares about Phoenecian or cuneiform.
Yet at a cost of over $28 billion a year, 75% of all statin prescriptions are for exactly this type of unproven primary prevention.

If you have $5,000 to take to Vegas to play at the WSOP for two weeks don't blow through it and take out another $5,000 at the ATMs. Pace yourself and keep the game fun. If you hop off the plane, throw your bags on the hotel bed and head to the nearest $2 $5 NLHE table enjoy yourself, but if you lose $500 right off the bat go take a break. Don't lose a big chunk of your bankroll the first couple of days after you arrive or you may end up going broke during the middle of your trip if your luck doesn't turn. It might seem trite, but I've heard of, and tried in the past, an envelope system during short trips to Vegas. Take two envelopes for each day of the week of your stay. Mark two envelopes for each day (two with "Monday," two with "Tuesday," etc.), place money in one and seal it and leave the other one unsealed. Only open the envelope that represents the correct day of the week and place any money left over at the end of the day in the other envelope for that corresponding day. If you have the discipline to stick to this you can sometimes guarantee yourself a profit by the time the end of your trip draws near, as I did my first time in Vegas.

The speed will catch it, and it will teleport the ball to the last point thing 6) reverse every thing to the start, and move the bottom right portal to the top left, the one almost facing the finish, then let go of the ball.

One popular type of massage therapy is scalp massage. Massaging the scalp can help stimulate the nerves and blood vessels beneath the skin while calming muscle tension around the head. Although many different cultures have used massage as a form of therapy for thousands of years, it's possible to trace the history of the head and scalp massage to India. The people of India have incorporated head massage into therapeutic practice for about 5,000 years as part of ayurveda, a holistic medicine. Many Indian women used it as part of a weekly ritual, massaging the scalps of family members to prevent stress and even illness [source: Osborn].

I think it really common for people to hit a wall while tapering, where they trucking along and cutting 100mg off their dose 5mg at a time for a long while and then all of a sudden it like the brain picks up on what happening and goes, "NAH." I always warn people it coming and recommend they go back up to the dose they last felt normal at and hang out there for at least 1 month, and then drop 2mg and see how they feel. If all is well, keep dropping 2mg every 2 weeks, and increase the mgs you drop as you feel able to. 
Many classic Twilight Zone tails have been retold without reference or allusion and many more have been parodied as cliche, but what made these stories so resonant (as I see it) was that, in the post WW2 world, conventionally existential anxieties were made tangible.In the 1950 America reconstruction from the Second World War was psychological compared to the rest of the worlds very physical reconstruction.

Ok pay attention noob cuz I'm only going to explain this once. We have a raising range and calling range and a folding range. GTO (Game Theory Optimal) means that you must make your opponent indifferent so that way you can't be exploited! By putting some strong hands into your folding range such as AQo you really throw them for a loop of coarse this isn't a "must" for the micros but you should get in the habit of it so once you start playing advanced opponents you don't make rookie mistakes like OP did. Perfect example.

In other words, your new car is all set up to communicate with the Apple devices that the auto manufacturer assumes most people have, and it doesn't really matter whether or not such an assumption is correct. Google doesn't like it because Google owns Android, Apple's main competition in the mobile device market, and accepting that iPhones deserve an automatic spot in most (if not all) new cars means accepting and conceding that Android phones do not. Why should Apple compatibility be the default and leave all the Android users out in the cold? And what can be done about it?

The man in shadow and sleeping figure (boy) in the buggy complement the white mustachioed bowler wearing man to the left; the men looking on in the foreground are interesting, too plus there that laundry in the background. Given that the laundry is out (and wasn just left out during the storm) and that no one seems to be particularly bundled up against cold, I going to guess that there was a break in the weather that pushed the temperature higher than normal, with almost everyone taking advantage of the warm snap, as people do everywhere, all the time. I also like the tiny American flag on the tall pole at left.. 
The film tracks Martin's 2012 killing at the hands of George Zimmerman back to Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law, which Zimmerman used to avoid punishment despite having pursued Martin through his neighborhood with a gun.

We drink more and sometimes do it in public, pretending it legal, while cops pretend not to see.We drive chaotically, making U turns instead of right turns on reds. We are far from puritanical when it comes to behaviour.As well, according to Cracking the Quebec Code by pollster Jean Marc L one of Quebec distinct traits is that we are non committal, indecisive and averse to strong positions and all I can say to that is uh maybe it true.So it unsurprising most Quebecers think Trudeau and company may have stepped several centimetres over the line in talking to Wilson Raybould, yet also think that a minor political offence, not a hanging one.Similarly, while major columnists in Ontario say Trudeau and his staff recent explanations are flimsy, or crock, while Wilson Raybould is the only truth teller, most columnists here say it possible both sides believe their own version.If you ever been married er, sorry, Quebecers, lived common law you know you can have the same conversation and remember things very differently.Wait a minute, that not what I said last month, that what YOU said!Hah! That exactly what you always say when I say that what you said.I never thought Trudeau was the Golden Boy much of Canada and the world did when it came to transparency and revolutionizing politics, so I not angry or hurt to see he just a politician.Similarly, I believe Wilson Raybould is a highly capable, honourable person who quit a powerful job out of principle.

To be clear this was a conversation directly about Halloween and she gave some specific examples regarding dressing as celebrities.

Usually, after the first set of cards is dealt players choose which ones to keep and then they can decide to play those cards in multiple hands.

In most cases he or she would then have to fold after the flop, but in some cases he or she might make his or her hand and win a very big pot. Later in the tournament, though, an aggressive player who accumulated chips early might be able to fold this hand, whereas a more conservative player who was getting short stacked might have to go all in with the hand.

To answer your second part, for my chronic pain I have to use multiple things, Cannabis is just one of those tools and usually something with a high THC content, it does nothing for my pain, no matter what strain, also doesn't matter if it's indica, sativa or hybrid, CBD does little to nothing for me. It may not help pain but it does help me break free of a mental prison, the feeling of being worthless because I'm disabled from events outside of my control, I do wish it had that effect for everyone, but for some it just makes it worse, locks them down into a state of panic and anxiety..

If you're not generating revenue for any of the parties involved then there is no incentive to participate. If you're just trading goods or services for a promise for other goods and services later, it effectively IS bartering. You've simply over complicated it by adding an extra step to the process, by adding in this arbitrary "contributor" currency that only has perceived value within the system you're attempting to support.

While the league and players agree that a 50 50 split of revenues makes sense, they can agree on how to divide that pie. The players want a sliding scale to 50 per cent to protect current contracts.

Poker was first widely played in New Orleans in the early 1800's. Prior to the American Civil War, poker spread quickly from New Orleans to towns throughout the Western frontier. Poker's spread was the result of a general spread of gambling during the era. The West was comprised largely of speculators and travelers, both groups that enjoyed gambling.

When the college parents say you can do music they don actually mean you can do music.

What happens if you're the type of manager who "steals" someone's idea and plays it off as your own? You send the message that you only care about your image and are ruthless enough to sacrifice someone else in order to get ahead. That's not a great image to have, and it certainly doesn't motivate the people below you to work harder.
Nevertheless, while the body is already mounting a war against a virus, flooding the system with several other stored toxins surely can make the person feel worse and perhaps lengthen healing time.

One of the things that irked me is that when you done with an online match, you can be miles away from where you intended to go, and traveling to the final destination can be pain. Another problem is that transitioning from multiplayer to single player could bring some of the conditions of the former to the latter. When I shifted out of a match, the fact that I was shooting at a rival player created a ruckus and the police were sent after me. This meant fleeing the police right after getting out of a multiplayer, something I didn want to deal with. I suppose that means players should use force more judiciously. Firing indiscriminately and running over civilians does affect Aiden reputation and makes some people more likely to call police if they spot him.

Well I might be stepping on some grey areas but the saying does have a somewhat accurate meaning to it.
