It was pretty sick to see. 406 points  submitted 6 days agoWhen I was in high school I made the highlight video for the basketball team. I went to a suburban high school so basically everyone on the team was white. There was one dunk the entire year and you can bet I milked the shit out of it. 
I cross referenced the schedule your strata corporation has been using since 2002, and she is correct. Someone in the past has mixed up the strata lots and the unit numbers. 
Unlike sitting down at a poker table with friends, online poker has an added dimension these days. There is a lot of pressure from many quarters to make online poker illegal, particularly in the United States.

In Costa Rica, I ran into trouble with Danish tourists who acted like they had conquered the place in the name of Thor, but no problems with Americans other than active vice seeking. Ran into Texans looking for coke and brothels quite a few times there, but they were otherwise respectful.

Adrian sits up, and even though we thought he got shot in the shoulder, it turns out he just got creased in the forehead, which would look really nasty, if it looked a little less like Rit dye made into a paste and smeared on his face. Everyone goes to the hospital, and somehow Hooker is the only one with a bandage on, on his hand. 
That was until he got up in my buddies face basically looking for a fight. I know my buddy, he's not a patient dude, so I stepped between them and told the dude as politely as I could to fuck off.

Although that last sentence is confusing and seems to imply that an Obama type person is also a lesbian, none of this would be important if Kagan would just say "Let me just say, I don have a husband and homo. So, as the Obama administration gears up to get Kagan nomination through the Senate, they should reflect seriously on the promise of "no homo" for uniting this country and putting us all back on the straight and narrow while simultaneously allowing for a multiplicity of sexual,romantic and even political affiliations to flourish.. 
Everyone cheered but my sis said she felt bad even though it was self defense because she knew the woman was just crazy and needed help. 
Develop the proverbial poker face. Keen instincts and sharp intellect must be combined with the ability to show no inconsistent emotion, or reveal nothing other than casual, fun involvement in the game. Look carefully at the corner of your two hold cards slowly/casually, keeping them face down, where only you can possibly see. Don't spill any information; so, keep your face "deadpan," and wear shades to have the eyes as expressionless as stone and restrain blinking and shifting nervously when you see your cards   and when the community cards are dealt each time. Avoid expressing approval or disapproval as if seeing good/bad cards (act the same way all the time as part of your poker face)   this is crucial if you're playing face to face.

Last week, Toronto Police Association President Mike McCormack asked officers to start wearing hats with the letters "TPA" written on them, to protest what they call a lack of progress by police administrators on meeting promises made this year, including hiring 80 new constables.
I will say, years and years ago this sub harped on ESPN and similar entities for being drama bait. "This sub" still does but there is more pushback to the complaints these days. This sub has grown a lot. 
And that making a lot of faculty and students at SMU a wee bit anxious. to say the least. Sadly, they were not able to forge a compromise with the university administration and so now they saddled with the cowboy institute parading as part of the academic enterprise, whether they like it or not.

Law enforcement hasn't always agreed with the legality of the sweepstakes. The TABC filed administrative charges against an Austin American Legion post that was using the same sweepstakes operation in 2010. The Travis County Attorney filed criminal charges, too. Both later dropped the charges, but a suit by the American Legion is still making its way through the courts.

The tips you have provided are good and applicable in a lot of ways. But your post comes across condescending and it implied the people who say they have been hassled are doing something to provoke that. I think there are people who blow some things out of proportion, and even in my examples, and the end of the day I am fine. But it has left me feeling a little soured. My husband works for the county and he sees a lot of disgusting behavior. The county at one point was paying for employees to get their cars washed because there was shit on people's cars.

Would you like to learn how to play poker like the professionals you see on TV? The internet provides everything you from the products you need to the information you need to know to reach this complex goal. If you are someone that wants to take learning into the real world it would be smart to check with any casinos in your area. Many of the larger casinos offer poker lessons at no cost in hope that you will gamble with them once you learn how. This is commonly done daily in Las Vegas, the casino capital of the world. If you do not live near a casino, professional tutors can also commonly be found in local classified ads or perhaps you have a friend that is willing to invest the time into teaching you the game. Someone interested in mastering such a popular game must have determination and passion. Although most versions of poker are fairly easy to learn, it is also easy to learn how much skill it takes to master it.

The protest, led by the AFL CIO, was apparently on point in its message: "Less Audis, More Audits" and "Wall St.: Never Again." other words, time to demand regulation of a financial industry that has brought the US economy and much of the world crashing down even as its leaders continue to earn record salaries. They earn these salaries by charging ordinary Americans ridiculously high interest rates on debt even while they live on taxpayer bailouts at ridiculously low interest rates..

Too much feminine energy would be "Barbarellas at the Gate" and they wouldn't be knocking   they'd be immersed in their feelings, paralyzed that any action may offend someone. They would call a group meeting to discuss things once again, long after it was time to make a decision. With too much feminine energy deals don't get closed, decisions don't get made, and prospects are never converted to clients. An overabundance of feminine energy, therefore, doesn't work either.
I can floor wall ramp rush. I can double ramp wall rush if I use other hotkeys than my normal ones, but I can do a single floorwallramp at running speed.

The final straw for this guy was when he was working a machine that was making parts that everybody hated working on, even me. The machine pumps out 4 parts once a minute and you need to grab the hot parts and snip the ends with wire cutters while they are still hot or it will become dramatically harder to cut. So this just required you to just sit by the machine the whole shift and do it, pretty simple. However this guy was slowly cutting parts, letting it build up and causing alot of work to catch up on. He also failed to mention that the machine started leaking oil on the parts for about and hour. So there we are just wipe down the parts already made with rubbing alcohol and cutting them. We had to shut down the machine for that and they put someone else on the machine after that. As we left for the day, he was fired. So not exactly on the spot in the middle if the shift all dramatic like
I don think it that they don know how healers work, it that they are only thinking about their own position and health and themselves relative to the enemy.

Spas still offer soothing effects for people but spas today are expected to be more therapeutic, healthier, and beautifying.

When you fully love yourself and embrace vitality, and really live your life, you are being the best father figure you can be for your children. If you set an example that you are someone who denies reality and lets themselves get walked all over, you are skewing your children chances at having a clear "reality meter" in life. They already see reality between you and your wife, whether thats consciously or subconsciously, so if you do nothing about it, it can really start to mess with their ability to know what reality is and what taking the right action in life is, when they face situations in the future where they are either being mis treated, neglected etc. Do the right thing for you to be the fullest, healthiest person you can be, and you will be doing a wonderful thing for your family.

History: Not Just a Game CardThe ace of spades has been symbolic of many things. The history behind it may be surprising to some. It is commonly known as the highest valued card, even though some card games give it a lesser value. Card games have been popular for hundreds of years the origins date back to the 17th century. Many viewed it as a symbol of good luck and good fortune. However, the ace of spade has a dark past in American history.

They need daily work.TheQueefer  11 points  submitted 6 hours agoAs someone who was also raised in a very religious household, it sounds like he shy. My family never talked about sex and what the christian schools taught me was all very negative going as far as saying imagining sexual relations with someone is sin. I feel like this has stunted my ability to express my sexuality because growing up I was basically taught that it rude and objectifying and that you just shouldn ever.

The girlhood of which she had been cheated seemed to come back to her with the ripeness of womanhood; she expanded like a flower of flame and perfume; no laugh was readier than hers, no wit quicker, in the twilight circles of that enchanted summer.

You research good strategy, you refine your strategy, but you have to keep in mind that swings will happen. Bad runs will happen. 
After you call his $75 lead you have $300 left and a pot of $280. Its a slight overbet to jam it in, but I think is the only option. Raising the minimum of $150 will never put any hand that has significant equity in a tough spot, and raising to $200 $250 leaves you just $100 behind which is super awkward on a lot of turns if flatted and will probably get overjammed by an aggressive villain anyway. 
Its a little difficult to think of Ellsworth Kelly, Jacques Villon, Grant Wood, Laslo Moholy Nagy and Thomas Hart Benton as painters for war. But its true, and true for many of hundreds of other artists in the 1915 1918 era.

If we draw a triangle to decompose the force, we will see that it just makes a 30/60/90 triangle. Thus, the y component of the force is sqrt(2)/2 of the original force. Since there are two of these y components added together, we can say that the total force is

With rape, especially with Rape Day, what you doing is to an innocent. It not about survival, it not about shooting someone because they just another combatant on the other side of a conflict, it about dominating someone who is weaker than you just for your own pleasure simply because you can.

The short, Saturday Night Life, concerned a black mother in Compton who dresses her three daughters up and takes them to a local grocery store, inviting compliments from strangers about the girls in order to feel better about her difficult life. This novice director had a budget of   don't laugh   $13,000. And a great deal of resolve. Saturday Night Life made it into the Urbanworld Film Festival, and that revved DuVernay's motor. She went to film school via osmosis, absorbing knowledge from her A list clients (including Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg), a couple of whom fell in love with and decided to produce a feature script she'd written called Middle of Nowhere. The film won the directing prize for drama at Sundance in 2012. Now, a mere decade removed from her first short, DuVernay has three narrative features to her credit, including Best Picture nominee Selma, eight or so documentary short films, and, soon, a $100 million adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's beloved children's book A Wrinkle in Time. The Oprah Winfrey Network premiered DuVernay's sensuous black drama series, Queen Sugar, earlier this month in part because co creator Oprah aggressively befriended her after actor David Oyelowo directed her to DuVernay's online profile.

It turned out that she was left for dead by the BYB because she had been bred so many times that she had permanent damage to her reproductive organs and had to undergo several surgeries to save her.

The temperature at the center of a star is kept high and very nearly constant by an interplay of a number of physical forces. The radiation produced by nuclear reactions in the interior can escape from the star only with great difficulty. It proceeds to the surface not in a straight line but by a complicated, zig zag route, since it is constantly absorbed by atoms and re emitted in new directions. It is this slow escape of radiation that maintains the high interior temperature, which in turn maintains the thermonuclear reactions. Only a star large enough to hold its radiations for a long time can produce significant amounts of energy. The sun radiation, for example, takes about 10,000 years to escape. A star weighing one tenth as much as the sun would produce so little energy that it would not be visible, and the largest planet, Jupiter, is already so small that it could not maintain nuclear reactions at all. This rules out the possibility that the earth atmosphere, or the ocean, or the earth crust, could be set "on fire" by a hydrogen superbomb and the earth thus be converted into a star. Because of the small mass of the bomb, it would heat only a small volume of the earth or its atmosphere, and even if nuclear reactions were started, radiation would carry away the nuclear energy much faster than it developed, and the temperature would drop rapidly so that the nuclear reaction would soon stop.

It indeed an anime trope, from fighting animes where the characters continually one up each other on crazy power levels. The stuff where they fight for a while, one of the characters seems like they about to win, and the other is like "you pretty good, I guess I have to actually use 10% of my power this time." This sort of thing usually goes on throughout a series with the characters, over time, doing more and more insane stuff, and at some point there usually an ultimate reveal where they show their true form or something like that and do some world destroying move.

Ive been thinking about this lately too. What the billionaires own is a bunch of paper thats part of an incentive system to generate in theory (and practice) efficient production of goods, services and capital with existing labor and capital of the economy. The paper isnt the the wealth, the goods and services are. If you seize the paper, you destroy the system that produces the actual wealth. Yes the paper bestows ownership of the capital, but continued ownership requires efficient production of goods and services. Yes billionaires consume a disproportionate amount of of goods and services for sure, but orders of magnitude less than when income inequality is measured by the paper.

Some interpreters consider that in one of the Pauline vice lists, 1 Corinthians 6:9 10, one of the words malakoi ("soft") or arsenokoitai (a compound of "male" and "bed") refer to male prostitution (or male temple prostitution): this interpretation of arsenokoitai is followed in the New Revised Standard Version.The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality states that prostitutes in ancient Greece were generally slaves.[5] A well known case is Phaedo of Elis who was captured in war and forced into slavery and prostitution, but was eventually ransomed to become a pupil of Socrates; Plato's Phaedo is told from his perspective.

Far as the International Headache Society and the American Association for the Study of Headaches have defined this entity (cervicogenic headache) it simply doesn exist. I pleased to say that thanks to the works of Drs. Merskey and Bogduk, cervicogenic headache is recognized in the IASP (International Association for the Study of Pain) taxonomy. This situation creates an enormous problem in addressing the diagnosis and treatment of headaches. Since most of the physicians and headachologists are unfamiliar with the IASP taxonomy, they are unaware of this entity, so diagnosis of cervicogenic headache is rarely made. Thus, there are a large number of chronic headache sufferers who go through life with the wrong diagnosis and hence the wrong treatment for their headache. It was the ongoing ignorance about this clinical entity that motivated the founders of this society to establish a formal organization. One of our goals is for this entity to be accepted into the general headache classification, and until this happens, large numbers of patients will continue to suffer unnecessarily. second North American Cervicogenic Headache Conference will be held in Las Vegas, March 22 23. Dr. Rothbart with be the conference moderator. Conference speakers include Dr. Bogduk and Howard Vernon, DC, associate dean of research at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto. The conference is designed for MDs, DCs and all other providers who deal with headaches. One of the sessions will specifically address the use of therapy for cervicogenic headaches.

I am very confused. How can SASAMS be implemented in foundation phase, especially at grade one level. We do not work with percentages. Children in the foundation phase progress as the year grows. Term 1 is a lot of the previous years work and therefor the children get high symbols. As the year progress some of them fall behind, but because their first term mark might be high their year mark is higher than what the child is actually able to do by the end of the year and might get an overall mark of a 4 for the year and pass. However, he did poorly in term 3 and 4. How can a child then pass and proceed to the next grade if his marks were deteriorating, but his year mark according to sasams, pass him.

It appeared to be a light rain with very little wind and no thunder or lightening.The Sea King, the model of helicopter that Marine 1 is, could take off in windspeeds of 50 mph, and this was initial testing in 1961.

It was really expensive for what I could afford (Like, a month pay.) At that price I can only assume sex was involved somehow but the idea of three sets of hands working my muscles over was pretty cool, and I was too chicken to go find three hookers and ask them to do it.

Another executive, who asked to remain anonymous because he does business with Facebook and Google, said the grumbling about data sharing has intensified to the point that it's time for marketers to vote with their dollars rather than just complain. It's possible to assemble campaigns across digital players that cooperate more on data sharing than the duopoly of Google and Facebook do, while achieving the same reach, he said.

There no indication in the LAOP the school actually bans VPN use, they just want to verify it user initiated. Colleges vary wildly on network AUP terms, and the colleges I attended specifically stated they do not monitor the content of student Internet usage.

It's so clear that Trump was wasn't joking about this issue, as we can see from the video footage when he says it, the follow up answer to a reporter asking him about it after, and the fact that a government facility was cyber attacked by a hostile foreign nation shortly afterward. Liberals Trump supporters have lost their minds so much to continue defending someone in a position of power who is actively encouraging different forms of attacks on our country. Have any of you actually listened to him when he joked about this encouraged this hostile foreign nation to attack us, and they did it? Then said he was completely serious about it when questioned?.

What I having trouble with is how you acknowledge the existence of trans people.

Because bureaucrats decided it would be unreasonable to destroy everyone bamboo things for no reason just in case they had some invisible disease on it, they figured they would create a system that travellers could use to get approval and get their stuff labeled as safe to enter the country without relying on the customs people to guess if it okay or not (Import permits).

This debate over epistemology and objectivity has been around academe for quite some time. I have seen it pop up regularly in my career. For instance, when I first arrived at my current institution, Middlebury College, an endowed Chair had just been named for former Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. as a law clerk,Rehnquist wrote a memo against desegregation in Brown vs. the Board of Ed and cited Plessy v. Ferguson  the 1896 case that established "separate but equal" as constitutional  as good law). the Bowers v. Hardwick decision that allowed two men to be arrested for having sex in their own home because it violated anti sodomy laws in the state of Georgia). Others argued that Rehnquist was "just doing his job" making "objective" decisions based on the Constitution. The debate raged on for years. The "objectivists" insisted that the law is impersonal since a thorough understanding of it will lead to "objective" interpretations of it. The other side insisted that knowledge is never outside of power, but rather always a product of it. In other words, ways of knowing, epistemologies, are always a product of the position of the knower in the social world.
