January saw home sales in Montreal climb the fastest in a decade as lower prices and a booming economy lured buyers. Sales in the city advanced 7.1 per cent from December, the fastest pace since May 2009, and the number of units sold reached a record. Montreal gains are well ahead of identical moves in Vancouver and Toronto where sales rose 1.2 per cent, and double the national increase of 3.6 per cent..

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsTV GuideDigital Print EditionRUGBY league great Nathan Hindmarsh played 330 first grade matches but it was a much bigger figure   $300,000   which made his off field story compelling listening yesterday. The former Parramatta captain lost more than that through gambling over eight years. It was curiosity that first encouraged Hindmarsh to put coins into a poker machine when he was 18 and at the start of his rugby league career. And when he saw those coins multiply when they fell into the tray, he was hooked. "If I hadn't won the first time would I have had an issue with it? I don't know," he said. "But I did win the first time and lost and lost after that." At 26, Hindmarsh defeated his addiction before it dragged him to rock bottom. "I didn't lose houses, cars, friendships or relationships," he said. "You can get help before it gets to that point." Hindmarsh, who spoke to 150 people at Albury TAFE as an ambassador for Clubs NSW for Responsible Gambling Awareness Week, encouraged people to speak up if they were concerned about their gambling habits. "If you have a problem you will have that gut feeling," he said. "Once people understood I had a situation and wasn't just pissing money up the wall, it became easier. "If you have that feeling of disappointment, resentfulness and disgust then you have an issue." Hindmarsh is not trying to stop people gambling   he just wants them to learn to do it responsibly. "It's about education," he said. "You always talk about drugs and alcohol and I want to add gambling to that list.

Watch how chips are put down. They can be placed down gently, counted down, banged down, slid forward, etc. If a player bets his chips very strong and far away from himself, it can mean that subconsciously their chips are going away from them, like they might be bluffing. On the other hand, a person betting closer to themselves can subconsciously mean that the money is expected to be coming back to them.

Sadly, instead of forcing the Pakistani state to confront administrative, structural and strategic demons, the international community's response to the Pakistani elite's poker faced bluff has been to raise the stakes.Pakistan's elite have already won this round, once again. The Kerry Lugar Bill discourse in Pakistan is characterised by patriotism and greed or both, but it is not guided by reason. No one, neither the military nor the capitalist elite have questioned Pakistan's seemingly limitless appetite for financial assistance, which is the basis for the formulation of the Kerry Lugar Bill. Instead, there is elite consensus around the need for other people's money.

Do I have the right to tell him what to do to please me when I already love him the way he is? One of the easiest ways to spot emotional immaturity is finger pointing. When we are without significant people in our lives, we are able to glide through life on our own terms, addressing our needs and wants.

From the book. You were just off for six weeks from surgery so you definitely lost some fitness, and despite having a strong history you certainly don have the base right now that Pfitz calls for prior to starting the 18/55 schedule. The first long run in the schedule is 12 miles. Have you comfortably completed a run close to that length in the last month? If I were you, I would build my base up more. Sure it ultimately your call and you can go for it anyway. Boston qualifying times are more forgiving for women so you got that going for you as well. But keep in mind that given where you are right now, it is risky. I think July is too early, but there are marathons that can qualify you for Boston 2020 as late as September and that would give you more time to prepare and get your mileage up gradually. You may be able to complete the mileage but I think you going to struggle to get the quality to be of the quality you need for it to help you.

If hes at that range or closer, you can ledge roll past him, any further, and you can just wait out the smash then get up for free since he in cooldown. Same applies to usmash (only dont ledge roll into usmash unless you got that hard read), but just know, online specifically, the backside of usmash is pretty safe, so you cant really punish it, but it slow enough to come out you should be able to block it on reaction if you watching for it, even online.

Tall guys have more trouble putting on mass relative to short guys insofar as the muscle is distributed over a larger frame (like you said) which means for a 6 foot guy to look as ripped as a 5'8" guy he would be carrying more total muscle mass which would require a larger calorie intake for both initial growth and upkeep. That said that's super subjective/weird if you think about it.

This influence didn happen overnight. What more likely is that these developments took place at an earlier stage in the more Celtic north and west of England, but only appear in the written record with the collapse of Old English as a distinct prestige language. This geographical aspect raises another possibility for the seeming lack of Celtic influence on English vocabulary; it may be possible that Old English speakers first came into contact with people who spoke a very Latinized "Lowland" dialect of Celtic that was distinct from what been described as "Highland" British Celtic, the parent language of modern Welsh, Breton Cornish, if Celtic languages were even present in the south east of England at all. Indeed, it seems likely that before the arrival of Old English, Latin developed in that area of England in much the same way it also did in Gaul, becoming widely adopted with Celtic dialects being spoken only in very marginal spaces.

I am not saying leave the students to rot. The best way to improve the calculus of these ridiculous loans is to make student loan debt susceptible to bankrupcy claims.

I like what they've done to flesh out his character in the series. Whether it was for that purpose, or to serve as a red herring, I believe they made it abundantly clear how compliant he was in Adora's torture. In this episode alone: he consoles Amma by offering her cake (unbeknownst to Adora), and he confronts Adora by telling her to cool it with the "medicine" (but then backs off and says it's "her area"). However, the BIGGEST kicker to me was when he cranked up his music to the nines (to hide any other sounds in the house, maybe?) and then tells Dick a blatant lie concerning Camille's whereabouts. He might've been able to just say "she isn't feeling well," but HE KNEW BETTER than to draw suspicion. Ohhhh Alan.

I asked the question in title to a professional MTT playing friend of mine. He a live pro that plays $5000 $10000 buyin tournaments around the world, including the WSOP Main Event, Aussie Millions, SHRPO, EPT and WPT main events. He gave me some good insight. He says that it really doesn matter which format of poker you decide to play, but your success primarily depends on your dedication to the game and self discipline. He never specifically answered which of the three options was easiest to beat, but he did tell me that somebody playing (a solid game) live cash in Vegas, Atlantic City, Los Angeles, or Florida would win money considerably faster (on average) than a player who plays $500 $1000 tournaments, live or online. He doesn play online much, other than the couple WSOP online bracelet events every year, and thinks that online is much too hard to beat nowadays. He says that the average player in an online tournament is only there to win money with their game that they been studying/practicing for hundreds or thousands of hours. And when you look at $500 $1000 online tournaments, most of the people playing them are the ones who have won millions of dollars online. Flip over to $500 $1000 live tournaments, where you see tournaments like MSPT, WPTDeepstacks and WSOP Circuit, where a sizable amount of the players there want to cash, but they dont put any time into studying their game, other than that one Daniel Negreanu training video they watched on YouTube uploaded in 2009. They have basically zero chance of winning these tournaments with their outdated ABC 2009 strategy, but they still keep coming back for the experience and that dream of winning.

Increased acid in the stomach may also result to chest tightness when breathing. This is a classic symptom of GERD or acid reflux. When the acid climbs up to the esophagus and affects the bronchial tube and the throat, then the symptoms of tight chest pain may be experienced. This is also called burning chest syndrome. The only way to reduce this pain is to control and neutralize the acid in the stomach. Taking antacids may help but chronic acid reflux should be taken to a doctor.

I don't think you consciously intended to misdeclare your hand at showdown (which is illegal) and were just making a joke. However "nuts" is technically vague too and this is different from saying I've got a straight, I've got J9 etc in your defense. Misdeclaring is an angle because as seen here players will muck prematurely out of frustration etc thinking that the dealer has verified the hand or that if you are lying you lose.

Oh my Poker God, does this sound like me a thousand times? Yes, quite. Here's the thing. A lot of times when you're in a hand you shouldn't have been, you try and justify how you lost the hand. It's a natural human tendency to do this, and poker players know this all too well. The truth is, you looked at a KQos from early position and then had to answer a raise from the unpredictable player two seats down. You thought it was a good move, but you are heads up with KQos, he has position on you and the flop comes Ks 9s 2h. You have hit top pair and want to show him the flop hit you. You bet. He calls. 2h turned. That didn't help him, and you really want him to fold now so put out your 4 bucks, and then, the worst thing happens, he raises. Now you know you're screwed. He has AK or AA, maybe even a boat, but he may just be trying to buy this. Not only that, those pot odds demand you to call. You do, knowing you are going to check the river, and have to call one more bet to see his AK suited. Herein lays the value of a tool you can use on your computer, called a poker calculator.

Wrdest du einer 16 Jhrigen die Verantwortung aufbrden, zwischen Indien und Pakistan zu vermitteln? Nein? Weils vielleicht abartig ist, wenn dann Menschen sterben und eine 16 Jhrige sich dafr schuldig fhlt? Warum machen wir das hier in diesem Fall?Das hier fand ich auch schon echt zynisch.

Dann hyped man sie an die Spitze und im Ergebnis wird sie fast erschossen und andere Leute um sie herum sterben. Dann macht man aus ihr ne tragische Heldin.

Bernard's last rock of the game, an open takeout, caught her team by surprise when it failed to curl   "She was right at the stick," said O'Connor   and pushed the Swedish stone into another rock at the back of the rings, and Norberg made a hit to force the extra end.Rest assured, there will be no fingers pointed at Bernard."Cheryl is the reason we're sitting up here now, she's the reason that we're at the Olympics," said O'Connor.

The technique was pioneered in the mid 1800s by German surgeon Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach, because of course it was pioneered by a German surgeon.

Trump does not have to answer questions under oath to prove his innocence.

Gestern war wieder Live Poker angesagt. In einem lokalen Klub fand ein 50 Turnier statt. Leider waren nicht ganz so viele Spieler da, weil DK ein Lnderspiel gegen Malta hatte. 25 Spieler sind angetreten, ohne viel zu arbeiten konnte ich meinen Stack aufbauen und konnte mich immer auf AVG halten und pltzlich waren wir nur noch zu 6. Kurz darauf bekomme ich AQ und ein shortie, der die ganze Zeit am shoven war, geht wieder all in. Mit AQ bin ich mit 3x so viel auch all in gegangen, und der spieler zu meiner Linken snap called, DOH. Wie erwartet, lag ich gegen den anderen Spieler hinten 3 way all in: AQ vs AKs vs 44, der Turn bringt eine schne Dame und ich bin jetzt auf Platz 2. Wir sind jetzt noch zu viert und das Turnier zieht sich endlos in die lnge, weil 4 5 ein Spieler von River gerettet wurde. Nach 1 Stunde mit 4 Spielern geht pltzlich schnell, innerhalb von 5 Minuten fliegen 2 Spieler raus. HU bekomme ich in der ersten Hand AJs und pushe. Meine Gegnerin called mich mit 68s. Flop 642, Turn bringt einen Flush Draw fr mich und der River den Flush. Das Turnier ist Beendet und ich kann mir 500 in die Tasche stecken.

To end my 4am missive here, we are currently training some amazing new mods. They are going to make mistakes. It's part of the learning process. I remember many mistakes I made back then. I still accidentally stick my foot in it sometimes! When your comments are removed they are not deleted. They are still visible to just yourself and the mods of the sub they came from. If, like I mentioned above you have a carefully thought out comment that has been removed, chances are that there's something in there that if you try modmailing us first, and if that's not going through for you (trust me, I feel your frustration there) if you politely reply to the removal comment asking if there's something you could edit, we'd generally be happy to work with you. Just like you, we'd like the OP's to benefit from as much input as is a available. To the best of our capabilities given what we have to work with, we do try to often follow the spirit of the rule, not the letter in every case.

It a weird situation. I just thought that if he lying about being raped for political reasons and to get attention and sympathy, it pretty gross.

Capitalism is actually a cheaper form of slavery because you don't have to pay for someone else's living needs, you can make them fend for themselves and only pay as much as need be to keep the fish on the hook.

Don freak out too badly about falling asleep with a baby in your arms. If you don move much in your sleep, you just want to make sure if you sitting up your legs are raised (extra support) and if you laying that baby has a bubble of non shared air.

Another argument against that nonsense is why would Turkey get involved in the F 35 project only to compromise what might be Turkey strategic advantage(being one of the few countries in the area to have a 5th generation jet) to the Russians who have nothing that could compete with such a platform? They acting like Turkey is going to gift wrap F 35s and deliver them to Russia despite the fact it be a completely stupid and irrational thing for anybody to do(even Erdogan. I only expect a moron like Trump to actually try something like that). 4 points  submitted 23 hours ago.

Might have even predicted that the Obama administration would be given far too much of a free pass by the "Left" to do whatever they saw fit, and what they saw fit to govern as a Centrist Right party, especially without any pressure from their baseAh, but I was ever so young when True Slant editor Coates Bateman called me up two years ago and said "Listen, we got this idea." course, I ever so much older now and can see that the world we have won is a bigger mess than I could have ever imagined.

This is our second pregnancy and we are planning on having a co ed baby shower. A friend gave me an idea of the guys play poker and have to bring a box of diapers to play, and to be honest, all I want is diapers and Target gift cards. Does this seem a bit too choosy?

I don't want to come across as ungrateful and I also know people don't want/like to buy things you won't use.

Only it fails, spectacularly, and he spends the great majority of his life as a young and middle aged man getting years tacked on to his original sentence while still inside, and repeatedly violating his parole/probation while on the outside: he simply cannot escape the system. (While this same prison merry go round can be unfair to many of the chronically poor and underprivileged people that cycle in and out of jail/prison, incarceration induced problems with employment, finances and housing, then more jail/prison, this is not true for JNs.

They use techniques their parents used on them. Yes, you were abused. You not alone. 
ECT is a last resort treatment. Informed consent should obviously include discussion of risks, and any provider not fully explaining those risks deserves to have their malpractice premiums go up. Good, go sue them, I applaud that. 
I find the champagne of soaps to be from places like motel6 and Days Inn. If it's an actual motel, you've hit the jackpot because those little soaps are like top shelf. Tip your housekeeper and ask for more if you find one that's this good. 
An ode to the Master artist Remrandt, this collection brought veteran designer Nilofer Shahid back to the runway after five years and onto a fashion week runway in Pakistan for the very first time.

God forbid you use the wrong tax calculator and you only make $50,000 a year and come April 15th you owe the government $2,500. I don know about you and your bad illogical logic (get the joke) but telling middle class to poor people to try to guestimate their exact taxes using a third party is literally the same as telling middle class to poor people to guestimate their taxes and risk fucking themselves over.

There is some word out there that the Russian honeypot lobbyist lawyer is a Comey FBI asset. The Russian translator was also an FBI asset working out of the New York FBI offices.

What got me was that everything else was pretty normal. Just every so often there was "something" in the room. Not like in the shadows. Just like, around. Right there. And it was different every time. Not like a recurring spectre.

That where she gets the abusive relationship crap. She wants so much to be loved that she doesn understand that they are taking advantage of her. She thinks that as long as they aren forcing her to have sex, that normal. Getting beat on, pressured to drug addiction, and dragged around into whatever dangerously extreme political bands they into is just fine, as long as they don rape her. That why she so shocked when Forrest defends her from harm. Why would anyone do that if what they doing to her is normal?

An aircraft/space vehicle like this it is noted could make the Berlin NYC flight in about 1.5 hours. (Valier was also the first to lose his life in a failed experiment using liquid oxygen, establishing him in a very unfortunate category of "firsts", becoming probably the first person to lose their lives in rocket flight; this is a similar category to Thomas Selfridge, who became the first person killed in an airplane crash, a 1908 test flight for the army with the pilot Orville Wright.)
I'm not discrediting that. But it seems lot of people are discrediting the problems of people who have money. They are still people.
