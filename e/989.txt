In the past (emphasize on past, lately, not so much) China has made it clear it is willing to maintain the status quo as long as the ROC government claims that there is one China. Since by the constitution, the land China is part of ROC, and we agree there is one China (country), then (by their logic) Taiwan is also part of China.

"It's interesting seeing what happens when they try to take a book and turn it into a movie," he said of the experience of seeing his work adapted for the screen.

We don't understand the potential side effects of the pipelines the data flows through, or what deeper information is embedded in the sum of all of it. Your approach is "well nothing is going wrong now so let the data keep being collected." My approach is "well we don't really understand the full system here, so why don't we hold off on collecting data until we've properly thought through the necessary safeguards as a society.".

Frustrated at Yorkshire's unwillingness to engage in a run chase, Middlesex skipper Mike Brearley once indulged in a "game within a game" with left arm spinner Phil Edmonds. Removing the short leg fielder, they instead placed his helmet at short mid wicket in the hope of persuading Jim Love or Richard Lumb to play against the spin for the five run bonus and offer a catch off the leading edge. "Childish?" Brearley asked in The Art of Captaincy, "Probably, but if it were not for the child in us we would never play games at all." His bit of fun led to the ruling that unworn helmets can only be placed immediately behind the keeper.

As if his previous misadventures in the verbal field were not enough we now have the spectacle of him being trumped by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In Yekaterinburg (Russia) the first thing Singh said to him (in remarks obviously rehearsed beforehand) was, "My mandate is to tell you that Pakistani territory should not be used for terrorism against India." Zardari could have countered with a suitable reply such as that his concern was to see that Indian consulates in Jalalabad and Kandahar were not used as staging posts for subversion against Pakistan. 
While in some cases there may be surface level similarities, and even in a few cases some deeper parallels, there no way someone who has actually studied Chinese syntax to any meaningful degree would make this claim.

We trokken het ondergrondse shopping centrum Okhotny Ryad: drie verdiepingen onder de grond vol met de ook bij ons gangbare merken. De foodcourt leek ons ideaal om het Russische eten uit te proberen, en we kochten eten bij verschillende zaken. de beroemde Bliny (gevuld pannekoekje). Daarna gingen we nog even tot het Bolshoi theater (van het beroemde balet) voor een leuk verstopte cache met een mooi uitzicht op het plein, en zo terug naar de metro. Rond half 10 waren we op onze hotelkamer, al een goede eerste indruk van Moskou rijker.

A fixture on true crime shows and in tabloids after Holloway's disappearance, he gained a reputation for lying   even admitting a penchant for it   and also exhibited a volatile temper.

I'm particularly disgusted by the lovely timing of TOW's procurement adventure. Right when OP's young little family is totally stressed due to dealing with a little kid's potentially fatal illness, TOW reminds STBX DH that he hasn't been getting his rocks off enough; her big stud baaaaby DESERVES some fuck time.

I say it pretty likely that football, historically run by men, has generally just ported over the training and technique models from men footy, without necessarily having much regard for the specific knee strengthening and stability focus required in training women. At all levels of footy, you bring in coaches and training staff who have worked around footy all their lives, it means they are likely to have mostly worked with men and know what works for men..

A few things make this whole ordeal even funnier for me. Back in 2013 I was booted from goonwaffe for awoxing a russian ratting in a vindicator (big regret, I was unaware at the time that BOB is basically NC./PL and goons were the good guys). 
It is a day when women are recognized for their achievements without regard to divisions, whether national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political. 
Except playing good poker online becomes about interpreting the numbers. Let say someone is playing 28/26/7 and someone else is playing 45/15/5   the software will tell you that, yes, but how are you going to change your strategy in light of that? Hint: it involves "using your brain" quite a bit, and is arguably actually harder to do than just playing a solidish default strategy (which you tend to see regs do in hudless games).
The EU is the only large body in the world that is standing up to Facebook, twitter, racist bots etc. that are scourge of modern society.

Examples aren't that hard to come by. In Florida in 2014, a Mount Dora City Council race was decided when the city clerk drew a sealed envelope with one candidate's name out of a felt top hat, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
"I am still having a relationship with him, but it is just not a physical relationship any more. And the sooner one comes to terms with that, the easier it is, rather than feeling George has gone and he is never coming back." Does she communicate with him? "I don't really want to get into all that. That's a dodgy question to answer because people might think I don't know if you have ever had anybody go who you have loved? Well, you do feel in communication with them because you feel so deeply in your heart that if you say a prayer, it goes straight to them.".

"People who are just starting to play poker; they won't sit for 30 hours to watch each and every hand that's dealt. For them, it will be easy to learn and follow the game on TV. While the hardcore fans will watch it live on the OTT platform," expects Burman.
Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my semen after it already dried out and solidified on the seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean semen after its dried out?

"There's been new equipment put at the satellite parks.

So it's a way that we can just partner and work together and just make our community a better place.". 
Right? The only one I think he may not do is arresting a man to prevent him from running for Congress. Even that one is possible. It would not surprise me if he helped facilitate something like that. I just can see a future where that particular one does not happen. If he is ever before a grand jury for any reason, and probably if one of his kids went before the jury, he will absolutely threaten the jury through Twitter in 48 hours or less. And there a sentence none of us probably thought we would ever say even just 4 or 5 years ago.

FOR SOME REASON they allow people to fully apply for apartments, plan on moving in and then they allow tenants to change their mind leaving the person moving high and dry or having to upgrade/downgrade. WELL rightfully so she didn't think it was fair at all and wanted the price she signed her contact for. And they wanted her also pay the difference she already paid for first and last. Completely ridiculous. So she argued on and off and got the "deluxe" studio for the $650.
If this were a normal parent, it might be considered just a moment of insensitivity from a normally loving parent. But, from a context of abuse, we assume a campaign of mind games, frequent attempts to tear down the OP sense of worth and sense of self, frequent attacks on the OP boundaries and maybe even physical or sexual abuse..

Instead, there are two reasons for it: Pre order bonuses (which are usually marketed to be awesome, but are quite basic and usually available later) online play advantage (the game is an online shooter, MMO, etc. I don want to wait and be left out or play when everyone else is so experienced).

Right now, Colbert, or should I say Stewart (because coordination would be illegal, now, wouldn't it?), is running ads in South Carolina through Colbert's Super PAC, Americans For A Better Tomorrow Tomorrow, using every device possible   short of playing flash card memory games with Rick Perry   to show how unbelievably absurd our whole system has become (even claiming Stephen Colbert is Herman Cain   a nice touch).
In real life a person beginning to go down the path of being a creep gets weird looks and begins to repel people. They have to moderate their behavior, it is a natural human instinct. That one weird friend who says something super racist, and nobody responds to it but everyone is uneasy and gives those looks, those nonverbal cues, that the behavior is not acceptable.. 
I hope more people take the time to cultivate their social ties. My best friend (not adoption related) had terrible childhood abuse, and she is estranged from her bios.

He didn't want to use realtors. About 6 months earlier, I sat down with a lawyer to form an LLC, pay for a sales contract and a lease agreement. 
Which isn surprising. He was so rude to the prosecution that he had to formally apologize. 
It puts me in an unhealthy mentality. My boyfriend (I'm a guy too for reference) watches more porn than me and I still struggle with being jealous and sad about it sometimes but we communicate really well and he explained it pretty much exactly how you did and I'm working on it. 
Ken was an active and faithful member of St Thomas Anglican Church. In his spare time Ken was never idle.

For this strategy to work, the fascist faction and their fanbois in the Murdoch press need to at least appear to fall in line behind their new golden boy Dutton. My worry lately is that they have been doing this a little too well, and it has of course all gone to Dutton head.

At one hand you see Jackie resistance to comply with the rule which can be called a Machiavellian art, on the other hand you see or should I say, don see Vito Spatafore who tries to end a major no no by dislocating Jackie from this world. The snow adds a different dimension as well, as it claims that the environmental circumstances could have prohibited this from happening, but it could have not prevented either. 
Fuck competition. In elementary school, my older sister got placed into the super small "gifted program" which was about 2 3 kids per year, out of 75 in each year. You took a test to see how advanced you were in certain subjects and then once a week you would meet with a special teacher and work on an extra projects.

The economic dislocation beginning in the 1980s and 1990s began the slow, inevitable process of not only wearing down our communities, but splintering them as well. We began losing key parts of our cohesiveness as a mid sized city, but the greatest loss of all was jobs, the meaningful, well paying kind. As the transformation of society continues, the decline of that meaningful work has left in its wake increased poverty, a number of crises, including the lack of affordable housing, and the loss of worth.

It should not be treated as an obligation and should never be done after you had a couple of drinks or when you are sick or physically incapable.

0My background is i have been playing poker for recreation and small stakes for a little under 10 years, Whenever i used to go to jail (often) I played cash games everyday in order to eat, And can only remember 3 5 times i left the table below what i entered with. My game play is looser at home games because it is with friends and drinking, So i would say my win/loss is about 50:50 at home games. My online WSOP account is 25m the second highest of my 900 facebook friends, and the only time i played at the casino i more than doubled my money. My recent success at the casino coupled with the fact that i consistently won at the table in jail makes me want to pursue it as a secondary/supplemental income. The success playing in jail really is a major factor in my confidence since it was 8 hours a day at the table with cash stakes playing against other people who did the same thing, 8 hours a day at the cash stakes table, for upwards of 1 year, while walking away less than flush 5 or less times. And yes, i was very impulsive when it came to drugs but when sober, poker has never been a problem when it comes to impulse control. Like i said in another reply, i intend to exclusively stick to 1$/2$ blinds hold em and enter in to it with a 600$/300bb bankroll in order to be able to have a safe buffer against runs of bad cards and potentially getting bled by blinds.

MYTH NO. But he looked whiter than he had appeared in Many fans assumed that Jackson, who had become a star through Motown Records in the early was turning his back on his race to continue his quest for crossover success and adoration from a white audience. Greg Tate, an African American cultural critic for the Village Voice and other publications, called him Negro gone mad because his mirror reports that his face does not conform to the Nordic ideal. Jackson insisted otherwise, and there has never been any evidence to contradict him. He told Winfrey in the 1993 interview that he lightened his skin with makeup because of vitiligo, a disease that gave him blotchy, light and dark patches, and an autopsy verified the diagnosis after he died in June 2009. His brother Jermaine Jackson also acknowledged the condition as vitiligo and wrote, looks like a white man splashed with coffee. As for Michael Jackson himself, he told Winfrey: a black American, I proud to be a black American, I am proud of my race. . . . I have a lot of pride in who I am, and dignity. 4:Michael Jackson did not invent the moonwalk

It's not uncommon to fold pocket pairs such as 7's and less in early position when facing a 3 bet pre flop. If you try to play them you'll have a tough time continuing out of position when 2 overcards hit the flop.. 
Again, if "not paying taxes" is your complaint we should work on making it easier for them to pay taxes legally. 
I had a conversation with my college friends like junior year, and we all couldn't stand our siblings when we left for college, but by the end of Sophomore year we were all pretty good friends with them (except the one guy who's sister came to the same college and insisted on hanging out with him a lot). 
Barometric pressure was the only weather predictor that was consistently significant.
Your math is not really applicable at all. You are looking at the overall probability of a random hand vs random hand seeing all 5 cards on a random board. You need to be looking at more specific situations, not some meta probability and thinking how unlucky you are.

I've read a couple of books to help understand her struggle and to develop communication tools, but it was The Buddha and The Borderline that pushed me toward mindfulness. 
And the mom paying off the remainder of the mortgage kind of sounds like fishing for the interest that she's set. If they had it in hand, there was no need for her to do that, other than to make a bit of money off it. With 4% interest per annum, she would make $1,800 in interest off the first year alone, and assuming annually compounding interest, she could get a fair bit off that.

The video, taken by a bystander, captured the chaotic scene that unfolded last Friday as officers tried to remove mother Jazmine Headley from the crowded office, where she had sat on the floor for two hours because of a lack of chairs.

As for poetry, I love Rilke poetry, it so visual. I can just glide into his poems and feel it all unfold gently before my eyes. Ginsberg HOWL is more like an acid trip, like you on a rollercoaster thrown into this fantastical world. Oh, Raymond Chandler is great, too!

Linguistically also they are isolated  North Korean is much different to the South Korean language, with many words in the northern tongue being seen as archaic in the south. There a clip I wish I could find of a young NK defector boy, who was asked to highlight words he didn understand at all in a passage, and he highlighted probably a good 1/3 of it. He had to use a special program to translate the words into the dialect he knew.

What do you mean by "prove". Practically speaking, if the disclosure is adequately enabling, it is "proven" by virtue of enabling reproduction. In truth, this isn always the case. Common and, imo, best practice is to file what called a provisional application at the idea/theory/ initial design stage and then update with nitty gritty implementation details when it gets to the time to make the provisional into a full patent application.

I sometimes end up with 3/4 length sleeves, but on button ups, they just don work on me and look like I wearing a shirt that has too short long sleeves, so I always roll those up to just above the elbow, and sometimes even just cut off the wrist plackets so the roll isn lumpy. It looks better than it sounds and I don end up with flappy, wide sleeves like I would with a men camp shirt.

100% disagree. Yes, there a lot of randomness in hockey, that why the team with the best odds only has 11% to win the cup, but it crazy to say that no one can say whether one path is easier or not. If we have to play the ducks, avs, and canucks to get to the final, would you really say that we can say that an easier path than having to play the Pens, Leafs, and Caps? Of course we can say that the first scenario is an easier path. Does that mean we won get bounced by the Ducks in the first round? Of course that could happen, that doesn mean that our path is actually harder. 1 point  submitted 1 month ago
The drain just had a cover because the part that actually plugs the drain is inside the pipe, kind of where that spring thingy is in the pictures above.

Audi describes the Urban Concept as a 1+1 seat, ultra light car for congested urban spaces. The automaker stresses that it purely a concept, but with parent company Volkswagen also revealing its own 1+1 seat tandem style concept cars over the recent years (2002 1 Liter and 2009 L1), we could just be seeing yet another iteration of a production intent platform.
I reported a bus driver before for closing the door on me and driving away when I had one foot still on the bus.
In Hold'em, because you start with only two cards, you have only one combination of two cards. In Omaha, you start with four cards that can create six unique two card combinations. The best starting hands have all four cards working together. 
The court information listing the murder charges points to the deaths occurring on or about Oct. 30, five days before the bodies were found in Middlesex County near the Oneida Nation of the Thames community.

First thing you need to do is get preapproved. Unless the realtor you are working with is a friend/family member, realtors typically don like putting too much effort in with someone who hasn been preapproved. I would ask your realtor for their preferred lender, or maybe a lender someone who you know and trust has used in the past.
John Parmeter told police about Father Brock being a regular family guest, and how his parents organised for the priest to provide personal music training for their children at the presbytery. Father Brock also became a drinking and card playing partner for Ron Parmeter, John Parmeter told police.

If you see a bear before they see you, start to talk so they hear you well before you are close enough to scare them. Most bears don want anything to do with humans and attack because they are sacred. If you don scare them and keep your distance you can easily have a safe bear encounter. 
Acting like anything other than a straight flush bets this board in live poker is whats absurd. Which means you trying to bluff with 50/50 at best (they either have the A or the 9 and they always snap with the A and sometimes with the 9). It fucking suicide to try to bluff here because you can block the nuts without having them yourself..

I against paywalls, vehemently so. I also do not believe the subscription model is effective, especially for smaller properties that need to "get known". My hatred of paywalls comes from my experience modding TIL. Many sites would submit content to our subreddit with a paywall and it would make verifying or fact checking a submission impossible. And I not requiring our subscribers to get a subscription to do so, nor am I getting one myself to vet the submission. So we immediately nuke the submission as unverifiable.

I still have some friends who make good livings as professional players, but at the same time most pros that I have known over the years have moved on to other ventures, myself included. I ask because the "gap" in your resume of work or education must be a huge red flag to employers (I know from experience, I took 3 months off at one point and it was a question in every interview). I feel like this is a consequence overlooked when discussing playing for a living.

We have a teacher who cusses and is super chill most of the time, can ask him for any advice and not get judged. He's in high esteem from everyone and every student respects him. I think this is because there is a silver lining where he's stern when he needs to be and understanding when he doesn't. Plus there's serious commitment to the job and so much extra classes and study time he offers us. Genuinely an incredible teacher. Our class is graduating this year and we're thinking of how we can thank him at the moment.

My school administration and nurse was very cool about the whole situation. They just needed the doctor note to make sure all parties understood what we were getting into. In addition, I needed to be supervised when I was self infusing   which I think is perfectly reasonable policy. I stored two 2k advate in my nurses office fridge. When I needed a shot, I just went to the nurse and joked with the nurse "Hey, I need to shoot up, I need my fix" (dumb joke, but w/e we were having fun) and just gave myself a shot. I think towards my junior/senior year, my nurse didn even care much to supervise. She was like "I eating lunch, just do it". The whole thing was very reasonable and chill. Only time I had an issue was when there was a substitute nurse for one day, I ended up getting the principal to come into the nurse office so he can clear things up.

The two are planning to celebrate with a first class trip to Australia and New Zealand later this year, and they also gave each of their four daughters some of the winnings.
It also helps when you're in an area with limited options. Generally the people who have a lot of money (doctors, lawyers etc ) refuse to play the lowest limits available at the casino. They feel it's beneath them. This leads to the people with the most disposable income playing 2/5 which juices the game. The 2/5 player pool where I play is 30% regs and the rest are people shot taking from 1/2, people waiting to play PLO and people with a lot of money. In my opinion it's much more profitable because of this. The 1/2 players are trying to play tight so they don't go bust, the plo players are fun because they are ready to gamble and the guys with money are usually arrogant enough to think they have an edge in the game or are just there to have fun.
The final tipping point for me though was when the young white chick who, up to that point, I considered my friend joined in saying how sorry she felt for him, he still a good guy etc. I was devastated.
