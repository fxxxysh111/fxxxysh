Contributing FactorsYour annual salary as a cognitive behavioral therapist can depend on factors such as the employing agency and your level of education and experience. In 2010, local government agencies and hospitals paid more than $40,000 per year to employees, while outpatient facilities, residential treatment centers and individual and family practices paid annual salaries in the $30,000s. Therapists with greater work experience also received higher salaries than recent graduates and those with fewer years in the occupation, as did those who held doctoral degrees. Department of Labor projects that the employment of mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists will grow by 37 percent from 2010 to 2020, which is faster than average among all occupations. With an increase in the number of men and women seeking mental health counseling and a trend among insurance companies to offer better treatment coverage, the demand for therapists will rise. The greatest increase is projected to be among individual and family services. Bureau of Labor Statistics. On the low end, mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists earned a 25th percentile salary of $34,550, meaning 75 percent earned more than this amount. The 75th percentile salary is $57,180, meaning 25 percent earn more.

This quote is from a speech by (Rabi) Israel Goldstein1 as head of the Zionist Organization of America appeal and was made in 19442 the British White Paper of 1939 on Palestine and allowing Jews to immigrate to escape "the hands of the Nazi executioner" in Europe. Among many other things the White Paper limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for 5 years (1939 1944) with limits of further immigration to be determined by the Arab majority. "Were our pleas for the opening of the doors of Palestine headed in the past few years, at least 300,000 lives would have been saved. Unfortunately, even the immigration of Jews within the limited quota of the White Paper was not facilitated as it might have been" wrote Goldstein. is a long and complicated history to the White Paper but suffice to say that while millions of Jews were being slaughtered in Europe the restrictive White Paper remained in place, which meant that the haven for escape to Palestine was largely closed relative to the numbers of people needing to be saved, and that at the end of the war there were still 3000+ visas that hadn yet been granted. Goldstein makes the case for the extreme peripheral usefulness of the Paper in 1939, but in 1944 when the Axis influence in the Middle East was minor adhering to the white Paper was a tragedy: "if the White Paper was unwise and unworthy then, it is more shameful and baseless now"3.

Basically, it became easy to find multiple partners for the first time in history and guys jumped on that band wagon (and each other).

The short answer is poker is absolutely a game of skill. However, it is important to understand the effect probability has on variance in the short run vs. the long run.

Here an interesting twist on electricity and the telegraph, but not quite what you expect. The note, written by "Moderator", appeared in Mechanics Magazine for 15 June 1825 (volume iv, p 148).

The interview he gave me consisted of two questions   "Do you have a car?" and "Can you start tonight?" This was roughly the same interview process faced by Dennis Haysbert in Heat.

How would they implement this in the product? Would there be perhaps a file with the md5 sum of every file in a module, and then that list would be hashed with a private key the developer owns, then verified against the CA?

They get into this in the documentary but the original anti cancer activists were environmentalists and anti capitalists who demanded that research be done on how industrial production and products were contributing to cancer and how this history and legacy has been essentially erased in favor of feel good "fuck cancer!" rhetoric that stages it as a "battle" with "survivors" instead of a massive public health issue that condemns most corporations..

Yeah this could be argued either way I think. Thandie was great and I glad she had as much screen time as she did. However, ERW had top billing and ultimately was the focal point of the show with comparable screen time. Maybe if ERW wasn so awesome then it could be argued that Thandie would deserve a best actress nod? I think the awards bodies play fast and loose enough with the rules that it would have been possible. Maybe Maeve will end up as the focal point next season and get her due. Either way I happy regardless of the awards nods they receive :)

Last year, Americans spent more than $80 billion playing state lotteries, that's around $250 for each citizen, more than what was spent on concerts, sporting events and movie tickets combined. Over 25 states took in more from their lottery proceeds than from corporate income tax.

Some bullshit about him making a program that "hacks phones in a 50 foot radius" and "collects all the data" and he talks about how much of a creeper his fantasy self is "hacking her photos." He said he found lots of pictures of a "missing girl" (that there no record of btw), supposedly tied up with her mouth duct taped. He said he had to "hack each of the phones individually to find out where the picture is from" (because you know, network data is always sent without a source address).

He fired George McPhee (Caps GM) in 2014 and the guy who replaced him won the cup just 4 years later. Whereas Ernie Grunfeld has been the GM of the Wizards for 15 years now and doesn have anything to show for it.I, and many people on this sub, firmly believe that meaningful and lasting change is not going to come for the team until Leonsis musters up the courage to let Grunfeld go; but it doesn seem like that going to happen anytime soon. It not something we particularly want but more of a service to the values we hold dear to us.Why does China have so many Warriors and/or Lebron fans? Because they are consistently successful.

Een afdaling bracht ons naar ons einddoel, Banska Stiavnica, maar wij lieten het stadje waar festiviteiten aan de gang waren, meteen achter ons. We hoopten namelijk nog de mijn te bezoeken, maar helaas waren de openings uren net veranderd waardoor we voor een gesloten deur stonden.

Whether or not these restraints   or Michigan's driving with a dog in the lap   will become law is anyone's guess. But one thing is likely: Even if your state does not strictly prohibit you from driving with a dog in your lap, if he's causing you to drive dangerously, the police will probably find some way to cite you.. 
Having taught English in a high school in Europe and in California, I can say that there were, for me, many more similarities than differences. The major differences were the kinds of test, the grading scale, and other administrative aspects.

Like it or not, Magic and Pelinka are going to be calling the shots next season whether we like it or not, so the hope is they learn from their missteps.

Instead of explaining, ask and listen. Ask her what her concerns are. Ask her what sources she would find credible. Ask her what she is worried might happen to you. Ask her if you could do anything to put her mind at ease (such as promising to stop if you have x, y, or z symptom). If you find yourself explaining again   stop and go back to asking, listening, and answering just her specific questions. Hopefully this will help her come to be supportive. Ask her if she would be willing to support you while you do this thing to be healthier so you can be a healthier couple together. People like to be asked for their support instead of being told to be ok with it (even if that not our intention at all)

However, despite the marketing advantage, I doubt most people are so loyal to their GPU brand they wouldn jump at an opportunity to get significantly better performance at significantly lower price from AMD.

You can only do this once with the same person (maybe twice if you skilled), but what works better is telling someone about a Trump story, but use Obama name. Ideally one that you know they will get worked up over. Once they espoused their hatred, reveal that you made a mistake, and that it was actually Trump.

(Think Self checkout in Walmart / Kroger.) The local restaurants can afford to. And then who will buy $6 Hamburgers from lone locations, as only regional, larger businesses, McD Wendy will compete on such prices. Less demand means further employees cut due to the less customers and less local/small open stores for those that can afford the higher prices. 
For example, it may be possible to use a cheap (couple of /$) Bluetooth shutter remote designed for smartphones along with some sort of app on a phone to start a timer when you begin filming. Then pressing the shutter button could record the current time into a text file or whatever, and you end up with a text file with a list of points in the video when you pressed the button, which you could then open on your computer while editing. Not quite as automated as what you are suggesting, but something like this may be possible and fairly cheap.
DeepStack has an algorithm similar to Libratus nested subgame solving, which they call continual re solving. As in Libratus, the opponent exact bet size is added to the new abstraction of the remaining subgame to be solved. We published our paper on the web in October 2016 (and in a AAAI 17 workshop in February 2017), and the DeepStack team published theirs on arXiv in January 2017 (and in Science in late Spring 2017).

But I saying it; This right there is garbo.Not everything is tho, happily, and I know how it is actually more than a simple translation as a book would undergo, it not called a localization for nothing, it has to match the rhthm of the scene/music, the tension, as well as the whole lip sync stuff and characters body language.

In the balance, a more progressive person is less likely to complain (or care) about Fox News on the screen in bar. Imagine, however, a staunch conservative entering an Applebees and being forced to listen to that lying liberal whore Rachel Maddow for a few minutes!

He says in the preface: "this book presents in a convenient form for reference a collection of the quaint theories about Natural History accepted by Shakespeare and his contemporaries.

The best players will beat you without looking at their cards. Over time they'll see how you react in various situations, when you bet, when you don't, how long it takes, if you touch your face, sweat, fidget in relation to what's going on in the table. They'll know how likely the other person will be to win compared to you and they'll know how to gain extra clues through raising bets by various amounts to see your reaction. If they think you're uncertain as to whether you can win, they'll easily scare you away with a monster bluff regardless of what they're holding.

I entirely cut my father out of my life. I made it very clear early on after the first few attempts by my mother to rug sweep for things to go back to normal that it would not stand and I will tolerate none of that (and I am more than willing to cut a bitch out of my life). She doesn try any more, though now everything is a dramatic "so abused and hurt by him being an emotionally vacant sociopath" because she is her own kind of narcissistic trash and was honestly the more awful of the two growing up (hence me ending up in the support sub for people with terrible maternal figures)..

"However, the return during a single playing session varies   a player may win more than they put into a machine or they may lose more than 15%."

What is most certainly not understandable is the willingness of GOP leaders, including John McCain, to exploit this sort of white fury for their own political ends.

Cheap option: dildos with a suction cup end (there are a LOT of these) can be mounted on walls and furniture or the wall of your shower or wherever really. I suggest buying one, mounting it somewhere you can suck/penetrate yourself on, and use that at one end and your boyfriend at the other.

Amaltheans and Eskatonics are both counter cultural elements within the church, and give a lot of room for characters to play priests who are not moustache twirling connivers.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the bond an option markets were dominated by traders who had learned their craft by experience. They believed that there experience and intuition for trading were a renewable edge; this is, that they could make money just as they always had by continuing to trade as they always had. By the mid 1990s, a revolution in trading had occurred; the old school grizzled traders had been replaced by a new breed of quantitative analysts, applying mathematics to the "art" of trading and making of it a science. Similarly in poker, for decades, the highest level of pokers have been dominated by players who have learned the game by playing it, "road gamblers" who have cultivated intuition for the game and are adept at reading other players' hands from betting patterns and physical tells. Over the last five to ten years, a whole new breed has risen to prominence within the poker community. Applying the tools of computer science and mathematics to poker and sharing the information across the Internet, these players have challenged many of the assumptions that underlie traditional approaches to the game. One of the most important features of this new approach is a reliance on quantitative analysis and the application of mathematics to the game. The intent of this book is to provide an introduction to quantitative techniques as applied to poker and to a branch of mathematics that is particularly applicable to poker, game theory. There are mathematical techniques that can be applied for poker that are difficult and complex.

Lex is right that it a great fold but i think it can be unpacked and understood in hindsight, especially if the guy has been playing fairly tight (i don know his image). He never getting called by worse hands and he not getting much better to fold since he can rep the straight because he have bet it on the flop to protect his equity. He can rep a flush by check shoving the river either because no sane person would do that on a paired board with the flush ace out there severely reducing the spade hands he could have, given that he 3 bet pre flop. And he really can rep a full house that isn Kings full or aces full because KQ would bet the flop, as would 99, for similar reasons a flopped straight would: equity protection.

Hmm I guess I would just say that if your key point is that being able to understand and accept many perspectives is more enlightened, I don think you need to tie centrism or moderateness into the equation. After all, centrism certainly does not have a monopoly on information from different sources or opposing sides my liberal and conservative friends are mostly capable of that too, though if you live in the American context with almost literally every issue (even things that should be completely non political) being politicised by the 2 parties, I would understand if you had a completely different experience. the only ones that should matter to you go beyond being merely transactional. That is to say that yes, there will be the transactional elements to them (if you buy a birthday present for your best friend, you do kinda expect them to return the favour, etc.), but these relationships are strong in spite of the transactional elements.

Focus more on the human side of management. In his 1996 article, "The Human Side of Management", Thomas Teal noted that "mediocre management is the norm" and that one reason for this is that "in educating and training managers, we focus too much on technical proficiency and too little on character But we're still in the Dark Ages when it comes to teaching people how to behave like great managers   somehow instilling in them capacities such as courage and integrity that can't be taught. Perhaps as a consequence, we've developed a tendency to downplay the importance of the human element in managing." Twenty years later, this still rings true. Poor management demoralises people and ultimately takes a toll on performance. At a minimum, perhaps we should have everyone read Bob Sutton's first book, on building a civilised workplace and his second one on surviving one that isn't.

I too have been to both and found the ladies only shower much more fun. Most of the guys just were not into being at a co ed shower. Mine will be ladies only. I also figured even if we did co ed, the guest list would just be too huge. Even with ladies only it is 30+ people long. My DH (dear husband) was thrilled he would not have to be at the shower. He would rather hang out with the guys else doing something more fun for him. I have heard of some people that the guys do a diaper poker party while the girls do the shower. So that is a thought too if you want the guys to celebrate as well.

Since you mention bonobo hunting, I think this is interesting: so the mythology of the Hunter is that women need to protect babies, so they don hunt. This is what we see in chimps   basically, it is risky to hunt colobus with an attached infant, so females stay out of it (although infertile females hunt with the males). This challenges the assumption of male aggression and dominance being required for hunting.

Modern veterinary medicine has made many advances. New vaccinations, medications, diagnostic aids, and surgical techniques that were once undreamed of are realities, helping pets live longer, healthier lives. But some veterinarians are looking to the past to find successful treatments that rely on natural substances like herbs or homeopathic remedies, or physical manipulations like massage, chiropractic, or acupuncture. Alternative therapies for dogs have been used to treat skin problems, digestive upsets, and other conditions. Of course, an accurate diagnosis must be made before you begin any type of treatment, but many dogs can benefit from a skilled and sensible combination of traditional and alternative therapies.

While it may be something of a sweeping statement, I did put the parenthesis addition there for groups it may not apply to   but more often than not it seems people have just expanded on the draw 2 with advantage by adding rolling cards to the equation. Often by the time people get rolling modifiers they seem to have forgotten the advantage/rolling part of the rule book, and keep playing two stacks until finding out it incorrect   and by that time many don want to change their way of playing.

They say that giving a cost while in a western society shows that the teachings are valuable. Sure I get it. but in my opinion as mentioned by /u/arfnargle, the classes aren that quality and barely talk about real meditation. It just a venting kind of sesh or the teacher giving an elementary view about the topic according to what their books say. I can do that for free from reading online. They shouldn be charging for that. They have retreats too which they focus again on lamrin topic. But, the teachings are still paltry in my opinion. They don even talk about the 8 fold path and they lack pure technique. It Vajrayana so they have empowerment ceremonies that cost $. These empowerments somehow bless you to be able to practice more advanced techniques such as meditating on emptiness and imaginal practices and tantra.

Full disclosure, I help run these cruises, but could answer a few of your questions from WPT perspective. The price on WPT Cruise includes port fees, taxes gratuities. I believe after that is sorted, its probably only slightly higher the price you were quoted from RCI, although RCI does run some great specials and you might even get it for cheaper directly if you just want to go on a cruise. We get our cabin block early and price might be a bit higher. The WPT rents the conference area w/food, brings the tables, chips, cards, dealers, swag, talent, instructors, etc, so there is some extra cost. The poker participation fee if $250pp, on top of cabin costs, which covers all this stuff, including freerolls, Q + meet greets with WPT talent LearnWPT mini seminars. If you have non playing guest, they don have to pay this.
The original version of craps contained a flaw where people could actually win. The sarcastically named John Winn introduced a new rule that fixed the hell out of that. Casino craps has been an incredible parody of religion and mob based cash extraction services (aka "an even better parody of religion") ever since. You obey utterly arbitrary rules, often with crazy and dangerous local variations, you invoke bizarre rituals which have never been proven to affect anything before rolling the dice, and the smarter bet ("Don't Pass") is shunned by the mob as taboo. To which we have to say: Well done, casinos, for making even Scientology look like someone begging for quarters in the street.

Bjorn and Agnetha were raising two children under 10 years old in the 1970s while making music and touring. Benny and Frida were parents of children in other marriages, so while their children might not have been living with them, I can imagine they would go to great lengths to get drugs. The entire band was rather health conscious (Bjorn saying he was "fat" in the "Waterloo" video).

Movies like Wonder Woman and Black Panther work because, in addition to remaining true to the tropes and demands of the genre, they expand the canvas to create something new and artistically satisfying. Although Captain Marvel strives for this, the creative impulses underlying the film aren't sufficiently anchored to realize the ambition. The film is being touted as the first MCU entry to feature a lead female character but that overdue groundbreaking effort isn't enough in and of itself to elevate Captain Marvel to the upper echelon of superhero films.

Quite often cash game plays poorly with shallow stacks. A good example of this is using push/fold charts for stacks greater than 12 big blinds from late position and 10 big blinds from early position. With more than those depths, using a push/fold strategy is drastically inferior to a limp/push/fold strategy from the small blind and button, and a min raise/push/fold strategy from the other positions.
