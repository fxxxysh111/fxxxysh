The Times portrays the ten month build up to Obama Afghan war as an incredibly well thought out process with lots of facts  thousands of pages of briefing memos and maps.

My input   I own an actual '84 JCM800 50 watt combo 2x12. It is 35 years old, and I just spent an embarrassing amount of money servicing it. (It had finally blown a power tube). Anyway,aside from the fact that the 50 watts are loud, perhaps too loud and certainly loud enough for anything I ever would need, it makes every guitar sound massive. From my single coil stratocaster to my Les Paul humbuckers, the master volume settings allow the tones I love so much on my favorite 70's rock and roll records.

My best friend had twin brothers that passed away one day and one month after their birth, respectively. He (then about years old) and some family members were sitting graveside and attending the funeral of the first when they received a call telling them to halt the funeral because they needed to get to the hospital to say goodbye to the other one. They rushed to the hospital, said goodbye, and his mother held the baby while he died.
To The Telegram: I was all set to watch the Green Bay game on Fox 21 at noon Sunday, but no, they had some stupid poker game on instead. The game was listed in the Telegram and Duluth News. I guess that's what you get when all the TV stations are in Duluth. They are trying to convert Pack fans into watching those Minnesota mud ducks stink up the NFL. The Vikings are nothing but losers and always will be. It's a good thing there is WDSM Radio 710 so we can at least listen to the game. It's no wonder Packer fans cheer for whoever is playing the Vikings.

The fact of the matter, though, is that there were some very high powered people at this meeting.

The post DD accumulated scores were not any sort of outlier in the distribution of post DD accumulated scores; most distributions of post dd scores will be this way. That very simplistic, but it a pretty easy illustration of why I think I right.

The Tzar Bomba was so impractically big that creating a parachute to slow its descent disrupted the Soviet textile industry. If you're wondering why they needed a parachute in the first place, it's because no matter how high you dropped it from, the resulting explosion would reach up into the sky and disintegrate your plane unless you gave yourself some kind of head start. In fact, the bomb was originally supposed to be twice as big as it ended up being, but they realized that it would be impossible to drop such a bomb from an airplane without killing everyone aboard. Also, it probably would have cracked the earth like an egg. Who the hell knows?
The approach amounts to "Afghan good enough" instead of an overly idealistic "Afghan impossible," said Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

If the moods shift in the future, and MIL feels like she will have more power using different tactics, she will change her tactics.

Like I remember this one time (when I was a student cosmetologist) she saw another student and commented on how her and my now husband would make such beautiful babies and how she thinks they would be good together. Every time she went there (to pick me up or to get service done) she would talk to the other girls and make comments about them to DJH about them being pretty or making beautiful/cute babies.

They have a pretty awesome lawyer and I making sure the mom writes down questions that she has so she doesn forget anything when they see her soon. They are not married and never have been, thankfully. They had a joint account when they lived together, but it has since been closed. Again, thankfully. The dad is money hungry and going down a dangerous path. He is his only concern, well money too. The way the lawyer talked, only the 3 yr olds name would be on the trust fund, but since she under 18, I believe there has to be an adult name on it as well. (This is one of the questions I also have), and if that so, then obviously the mom HAS to be the one whose name is on it. Dad will blow thru it in a month, maybe even less than a month. Same with the mom settlement. The mom wants to make sure her child gets what she entitled to, because obviously things are expensive and well, she deserves it. Mom has her head on straight and her 1 priority is that baby girl. I just want to be here to support her and help her however I can. Dad is seriously disturbed. he emotionally and verbally abusive towards mom. I know them both, have for years. I have actually known the dad for a longer amount of time, but he been this way for years. I want to make sure mom has support and someone there for her. she is an amazing human and so is that baby! She had to learn how to walk all over again. I do an updated post once it all settled too.

Ephimia Morphew, a psychologist and founder of the Society for Human Performance in Extreme Environments, told me of a series of accidents she been studying in which scuba divers were found dead with air in their tanks and perfectly functional regulators. they had pulled the regulators out of their mouths and drowned. It took a long time for researchers to figure out what was going on. It appears that certain people suffer an intense feeling of suffocation when their mouths are covered. That led to an overpowering impulse to uncover the mouth and nose. The victims had followed an emotional response that was in general a good one for the organism, to get air. But it was the wrong response under the special, non natural, circumstances of scuba diving.

This is a huge subject. But the basics are this. Players deposit identical amounts of money with the tournament director or website. Example, $50. Each player receives the same number of chips, perhaps 1500. Now play begins with a clock counting the levels. Typical tournaments change levels every 12 20 minutes, so after one hour your blinds will have increased several times. This is crucial to the success of the format because it's impossible to just sit back and wait for the best hands, as you will slowly be eaten away by the increasing blinds. You are pressured to make moves with weaker than premium hands, which in turn narrows down the tournament field as people get eliminated. The prize money is divided among the players. The more players there are, the more places will be paid, but the top three receive the majority of the prize pool. More detail on tournament play is on the attached link. (Full Answer)

Generally you speak in your conversation in the language that you think the most people will understand. If you have trouble, you switch for a phrase and then try to explain it or ask for help explaining it. Sometimes big groups fracture, and in that instance it ok to speak in the most common language there, but if someone joins, you may want to switch back when you would normally say "we were just talking about X." What you should not do under any circumstance is proceed to speak in a language that someone does not understand (unless you share no languages) because that is just telling them that they are not welcome in the conversation.

You're a charismatic, talented individual performing in front of a crowd, everyone's energy is up, but when emotions run that high, it's a very short step from a guy wanting to buy you all the beer in the world to threatening to shove a bottle in your eye socket because "HOLY SHIT YOU SMILED AT MY GIRL, WHAT THE FUCK BRO, LET'S FIGHT!"You Will Get MuggedWhen you first start performing magic on the street, you mainly worry about messing up a trick in front of a crowd or finding a suitable birthday present for David Blaine after he inevitably sees your act and wants to become your best friend.

8) Excessive Spam. Posting multiple threads a day in excessive use. Even vs a monster opponent who bluffs correctly in every spot. The reason is because 90% of the EV comes from hands in somewhat proximity to the nuts. As soon as a hand is crushed by a broad class of hand combinations (say being demoted to second pair), its EV drops tremendously. For example, middle pair, no draw facing a big double barrel is a pure bluffcatcher. Folding that hand every time doesn concede that much even to a balanced opponent. Vs a normal underbluffing opponent folding it probably correct. This discovery has helped me stop over analyzing trivial spots. You don get punished that much. In Piosolver you can fix hero strategy (say folding more of his bluffcatchers) and let the computer try to maximally exploit that. It turns out it can only be exploited for a small ish amount, as most of those bluffcatchers were just barely +EV calls. And a human opponent who bluffing too much isn maximally exploiting us. He will inevitably pick some bad spots, use bad sizings, and pay off the top of our range sometimes. I actually have it installed on my work PC because I get more use out of it from there.
