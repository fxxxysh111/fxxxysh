I understand the controversy around fasting. I'm using the OMAD right now because I'm with you, I prefer not to calorie count. (If my schedule worked with lifting, I'd be down with calorie counting because I believe muscle gain has to be fueled properly.) But I don't talk about it because I want to model good eating habits for my kids, and OMAD and its cousin fasting are not in anyway presentable as healthy for healthy weight minors. Especially when they have friends who are borderline anorexics. Luckily with them in school and me at work all day, it doesn't come up, and I cook a relatively healthy dinner every day.

Editor's Note: The gut brain axis an imaginary line between the brain and the gut is one of the new frontiers of neuroscience.Microbiota in our gut, sometimes referred to as the "second genome" or the "second brain," may influence our mood in ways that scientists are just now beginning to understand.Unlike with inherited genes, it may be possible to reshape, or even to cultivate, this second genome.As research evolves from mice to people, further understanding of microbiota's relationship to the human brain could have significant mental health implications.a scientist, I often find myself chatting with friends and neighbors about the latest advances in neuroscience.In the past few years I have found more and more people asking about microbiota the microorganisms that typically inhabit a bodily organ.In the last 10 years, I've been one of many neuroscientists advancing new ideas about how microbiota in the gut affects brain function.The media has taken notice as well.Recent stories on the gut brain axis among the most exciting new frontiers in neuroscience include "Some of My Best Friends Are Germs" in the New York Times Magazine and "Gut Microbes Contribute to Mysterious Malnutrition" in National Geographic.In 2012, the editors of Science thought the research important enough to devote a special issue to the topic.Why is the issue so fascinating? For one thing, it's heightened consciousness of how diet and nutrition impact our health.For another, it's sheer numbers.Our brains contain billions of neurons, but we less often talk about the fact that trillions of "good" bacteria are alive and well in our intestinal tracts.Remarkably, these naturally occurring, ever present commensal bacteria may be instrumental in how our brain develops, how we behave, react to stress, and respond to treatment for depression and anxiety.With such serious mental health implications to consider, there is substantial buzz among neuroscientists about the bidirectional nature of these seemingly infinite relationships.I am continually impressed by the creative ways that my colleagues are making discoveries, especially in how microbiota may influence the brain and the immune system during early life.And just last week researchers at UCLA found that regularly eating yogurt with probiotics, which contain "good" bacteria, seems to affect brain functioning in women.Scientists have recognized communication between the brain and the gut for more than 100 years, with studies in the early 19th and 20th centuries showing that a person's emotional state can alter the function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.1 3 One of the best examples is the work of William Beaumont, an army surgeon, who became known as the "Father of Gastric Physiology." In the 1830s, Beaumont, who was able to monitor gastric secretions through a fistula (a permanent opening in the stomach wall), noted an association between changing moods and gastric secretions.

Most of the players who returned from injury have been playing poorly since they returned, most noticeably Forsberg.

Furthermore, and humorously, you don even realize that I used your own flawed logic against you; when you insisted in an earlier reply that "it doesn make sense" for a "lawful character" or a "thief who doesn get caught" to be in prison, I couldn believe you were unable to think of why. Even I can think of easy justifications: Innocent law abiding people are thrown in jail all the time just because they likely suspects, or because the law officers are corrupt. The thief who "doesn get caught" logically must been caught before, so he/she must have the experience required to know how not to get caught.

And by "robots" I not talking about the the sophistication of AI and the Singularity; mainly they are posts about the first or early ventures in replacing some aspect of human activity with a machine. The Pop Mech article that addresses this in very simple terms: "The Automatic Age, Millions in Pennies" appearing in the October issue, does come close to using the term and concept of "automation" here, though that word does not make an official appearance in this context for another 16 years. The discussion in the article is on curious applications for machines, like penny fortune teller dolls, automated public hair dryers, and "drink dialers" (after the deposit of a nickel you would use a telephone dialer to order your favorite beverage). There also some recognition of an automatic grocery which was "devoid of time wasting conversation" with store clerks, the machine also being equipped with a "mechanical brain" to make change as your dropped in your dime for some 5 cent canned corn. Also among the moderns here were "pin" (pinball machines of a sort) games, automatic scales, and a very odd phrenological device. If you dropped two bits into the automated room opener you were allowed into a "tiny room" where the renter was allowed a "cot, hooks, hangers, a chair, a mirror, wash basin, soap, a towel, and privacy for the night".

In fusion the rate of reaction is governed by entirely different factors from those in fission. Fission takes place when a nucleus of uranium or plutonium captures a neutron. Because the neutron has no electric charge and is not repelled by the nucleus, temperature has no important influence on the fission reaction; no matter how slow the neutron, it can enter a uranium nucleus and cause fission.

Aromatherapy is already helping office workers stay alert while doing repetitive mental tasks.

Tight/Weak  Tight/weak players usually have a fairly good idea of proper starting hand selection and stick to it. They rarely raise unless they have the absolute best hand, and they prefer to check and call to see what is coming next. The biggest problem with this type of play is that tight/weak players rarely protect their hand (by betting or raising to narrow the field) and are often beat by a player who hits a draw or miracle card. Tight/weak players may show a small profit in games full of poor players because of their proper starting hand selection, but solid players will run over tight/weak players. The tight/weak players are called "Semi Weak."

There are two main reasons for this:1) In poker, people fold early, and the more people that are at the table the more likely you should fold, so in practice most hands become 2 player pretty quickly.2) In poker, there is basically no opportunity to collaborate. You can team up with one player to take down another player. Trying this would be collusion and it would be against the rules.For these reasons, people that I have spoken to who develop poker AIs as training tools (or as "training tools") tell me that these techniques all work well in 6max too, and that for basically every popular poker variant that is played online there are now superhuman AIs.In 3+ player games, Nash equilibrium only guarantees that you cannot do better by unilaterally deviating to a different strategy.

The betting goes around the table in order until it reaches the player who posted the small blind.

And the reason that is so is because breeds were purposefully engineered. No such thing happened with humans.

I 23 and have had 2 abnormal paps, 2 colposcopy procedures where they biopsy my cervix and a LEEP procedure where they removed the abnormal cells caused by HPV. A pap test will test for HPV.

Of course, take all of your concerns and talk to your doctor!

Yes, a very important point you made Empiar. That of the social dynamics of such situations.

I sort of think Wildstar might have found, or at least oriented towards, a good balance. The raids were recognized, even in the narrative, as big collaborative efforts of similarly skilled people. When you interacted with Drusera, while she was soliciting help from YOU, there were beats where she was quite clearly also getting help from other similarly skilled adventurers on other tasks so even though you were clearly important, you weren the ONLY important PC in the game..

Addiction is complex but it involves rewarding behaviour, for some it having a smoke, gambling, farming in games.

So when Sire spawns, there only 1 attack you need to be careful with. It when he spawns the poisonous pool underneath you. You know it spawns when he sort of cramps up. Don really know how to describe it. When he does, move two tiles to the left or right. As long as you move away as soon as the pool spawns below you, it won do any damage. If you like to hit the Sire twice with the DWH spec, make sure to watch him between attacks, as the downtime between your spec is enough for him to spawn a poisonous pool. He also has an attack where he will summon a spawn. The animation of both these attacks look similar.
It really is.

Should a chassis ground be connected to the power source, it would be a straight short to ground from the power supply. Identification of all the wires extending from the motor should be identified, by either use of an ohm meter, and in some cases, the only way to know is to remove the end housings and physically identify where the external leads are connected on the windings. Because a capacitor is involved it is likely two of the five wires are dedicated wires for the capacitor, leaving two for power, and one as a chassis ground.

I was really creeped out. 
Disagree. Big self titled fan over here and The Colour In Anything puts me to sleep. Self titled is half as long, and the songs themselves are a minute shorter on average than on The Colour in Anything. The songs feel more diverse on the self titled, the production sounds more up front and full. Colour is much spacier, quieter. The songwriting is also kind of predictable: we start in a sparse echoey place with his voice, some drums, probably a piano, and then build up to an underwhelming crescendo. It too quiet and empty and the parts that feel like they supposed to stun me do anything but. Now this is just my opinion, of course. No doubt my opinions are rose colored due to his self titled being one of those early albums I clung onto when first exploring music on my own. But to me it felt like a bunch of under produced demos, a collection of b sides.

And if you are hoping a "practical" approach to developing an understanding can be knocked out in a weekend or two by watching 5 or 10 YouTube videos, then IMO, you in for an unhappy surprise.If you just want to learn the bare minimum, essential understanding of data networking, then buy a CompTIA Network+ book and go to town.If you think you might want to maybe become a networking professional later, but don want to over commit to that goal just yet, then buy a Cisco CCENT study guide, download the newest version of Packet Tracer, and get to work.There are a bunch of theoretical concepts that you just have to wrap your mind around.How you implement or manipulate them depends on the equipment platforms.Aruba is similar to Arista, Arista is similar to Cisco, Juniper is kinda similar to Cisco, etc.Once you understand the concepts, and you know what feature you want to turn on, or tweak, fumbling around in the device specific configuration syntax or GUI is just minor frustration.But if you approach this with a "I don want to know all that stuff, I just need to know what to type to build a VLAN." kind of mentality, then you are in for a world of hurt.If you put "I know networking" on your resume and all you know is what to type to create a VLAN, but you don understand why you might want a VLAN in the first place, I going to destroy you in our interview together.The community over in /r/ccna is super helpful and packed full of several thousand people all trying to learn networking.The community over in /r/networking CAN be super helpful in providing deep, advanced understanding of specific concepts.

Going by ground realities, Pakistan and US can certainly be termed as 'Odd Couple' with an 'all time low' ratings in relationships around military and political arena while efforts continues to make amends through cultural diplomacy.Though it was not a 'stage thumping fun filled affair', but the love hate theme of the play certainly provided food for thought for those looking for ways to untangle the conflicting knots in relationship behind the curtains for the sake of peace. Walking over the bridge of cultural diplomacy, the play offers a new theory of mutual understanding and survival to 'differ to make a difference and disagree to agree for a peaceful coexistence'.US Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter and his wife Dr. Marilyn Wyatt graced the opening ceremony of the play along with a heavy contingent of US Embassy officials and staff members.
