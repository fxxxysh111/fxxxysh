Considering the trash heap who brought vaccines cause autism into public consciousness isn even the mother of an autistic child, I imagine this commenter as a not shit parent is concerned on two fronts. One, not vaccinating is a danger to their children and literally the entire species since anti vaxxers seem set on brining back almost extinct diseases. Two, what people who choose to not vaccinate because of autism fears are saying is that it is better to risk a dead child than to have a child like the two they have. And those are kind of fighting words.

It a great place to stop in and feed your drama hunger but part of the reason I thought a subreddit would be fun was because a lot of the contributors on DWIL are rather hard assed. Yes, they can be a great resource to teach/tell what is or isn normal or boundary stomping or passive aggressive behavior. But some of them (I felt) were instantly as /u/baby_purple stated instantly advising divorce or cut off. 
The Kree/Skrull war is one of the classic Marvel comics storylines; its introduction here is haphazard and less effectively realized than one might expect from something so deeply embedded in Marvel lore. Although the movie might have benefitted from a more detailed exploration of the conflict, time constraints allow for no more than a quick overview. Captain Marvel always seems to be rushing from one set piece to the next, trying to cram too much story into two hours. 
I don know if your wife also suffers from sensitivity at her cervix that would cause issues with fitting a diaphragm or cervical cap, but it might be worth talking about with her doctor.

When Paddock bought a house in Brevard County, Florida, in 2013, he told neighbors he lived in Las Vegas, but wanted the home as a base to search for a place for his mother.

Inside, Judy noticed, the place was outfitted sparsely, almost like a dorm room, with minimal furniture but two computers. Paddock showed Judy wife a laptop on which he just won $20,000 betting online.

As for weed. I picked up from a friend in Berlin and he gave me really shitty stuff. The nugs were broken up and crumbled and I couldn make out any sticky THC crystal goodness. It got me high but the quality was awful. Your best bet would be to meet people at FU who have connections, or hang out in Kreuzberg and meet people there who can hook you up. I noticed that most Germans are dicks about weed unless they smoke it themselves. Just really judgmental about it. The best stuff I had is in Stuttgart, though.

Literally none of your points are touching on any of mine. You don seem to be able to argue the ideologies but only the effect of the ideologies. You seem to think they are some how synonymous which I don understand at all. I am not interest in going through history and and comparing people who claimed to have followed each ideology because as I stated many times, people can say one thing, but act a completely different way. The only two people who can do this, as I have pointed out millions of times but you avoid like the plague, is Mohammed and Jesus. My argument is centered around comparing the lives of these two people because on the most basic level, these are the people each respective religion followers are suppose to emulate. You are familiar with WWJD wrist bands? However, you call it arbitrary when they literally are the MOST IMPORTANT figures of these religions and then you go on and talk about how people interpreted it like somehow their lives a better example of the ideology than the actual figureheads of the respective religions. Come on that ludicrous.

Yeah, it probably theoretically a fine line to end up here with 4c5c, but it sucks to play. When UTG is a competent player and takes a line like that, you looking at a nutted range. You lead into the previous rounds aggressor who is still left to act, so UTG calling your lead with an overpair would be suicide. That pretty much leaves them with A9s, 97s, T8s, some 33 (if they open these pre), 99, some 66, and 77. 77 would be especially gut wrenching, but could make sense with a bet flop, check turn line. But 99 also makes a ton of sense with that line. What did they end up having?

Also, you know, the US president saying "The Germans are bad, very bad," and calling German companies a national security threat to the United States, while siding with the President of Russia against his own intelligence services and his allies, while saying he "wouldn necessarily" come to the aid of a NATO ally attacked by Russia. This comes on the heels of the US arresting and torturing a German citizen, spying on Germans and bugging the German chancellor personal phone, and initiating war after war that have resulted in the migrant crisis Germany now faces.. 
But the people hit hardest are young people, who get a grossly inefficient economy plus have to pay that shit back someday.And, the GOP knows all this, they also know that the "greatest generation" and Baby Boomers are their most important demographics, and so they keep giving them handouts, knowing full well that younger people (who are way less likely to support the GOP) are getting the shaft.

Physical DemandsThe physical demands of massage therapy are distinct from those in other manual labor positions. Therapists spend sessions on their feet, which taxes the lower body.

Therapists sometimes need to take break from their work to preserve hand strength.

Lopez credits Armsby's selection to his "time in the game" building relationships with local brewers, such as Hill Farmstead's Shaun Hill. For more than a decade before Armsby Abbey opened in 2008, he and his wife, Sherri Sadowski, were curating the beer list at the Dive Bar, another Worcester institution. Lopez says having a head start on the recent craft beer explosion was an advantage, but the focus remains the same.

My dad was a mechanic. He was an honest one too. Ran a shop out of his house and was good to people. I cannot even recall the number of times he would come in the house and we would drive into town to look at someone car. I was always annoyed because we would be there for what felt like forever, but he would fix simple stuff for free or for hardly any money if it was an emergency. I didn appreciate that until I was older and one day realized that there a good chance he seriously helped hundreds of people by just fixing little things in parking lots or on the side of the road. One winter this lady had a dead battery in the grocery store parking lot and he put me and my brother in the truck (this piece of shit brown 80 Chevy with afterburner level heat) and proceeded to help fix her car. He told her to put her two kids in his truck too to keep them warm. I felt awful because I was sick and just wanted to go home and go to bed. I will never forget the little boy telling me their heater doesn work in the car and they hate leaving the house because it is so cold in the car. My dad fixed her battery and then I told him about the heater. He hopped back out and told the girl to drive to our house where he swapped out the heater element for free in like no time at all. I was always perplexed by how someone so altruistic could suffer so bad from alcoholism.

Further research has found that the pathways used by pain impulses excite not only the areas of the brain that experience physical sensation, but also those associated with emotion and cognition [source: Chapman]. Pain is not only a physical experience; the association of cognition   higher awareness   and emotion attach meaning to the experience of pain. These additional features of pain appear to help humans create more refined memories of a painful experience, which may help keep the person from repeating it in the future [source: Ackerman].

I don support Trump, but I can totally see how he can use these issues to invalidate anything Cohen says that can be independently verified.

I actually really enjoyed his character in the show. He genuinely cares for Camille and develops very serious feelings for her that feel fleshed out. The part last episode where he got angry and said mean things out of heartbreak (not excusing it as okay but it felt understandable in the context), but you could see in his face how much he cared for her this episode even after all that stuff with John went down. I'm not sure how to interpret his reaction to her scars in the show, but it definitely wasn't the outright disgust he had in the book. Giving it up to Messina for a stellar performance.

Top 10 Ways on How to Catch a Cheating Husband by by Stephany Alexander
Lincecum, a Cy Young in his future? Tim Lincecum (11 3, 2.71 ERA) is a Cy Young candidate this year, but the bullpen is not helping his cause, blowing leads in his last two starts. In those starts, he thrown 14 innings, given up just three runs and struck out 24 batters and have nothing to show for it. Lincecum could have 13 to 15 wins by now   maybe more if the Giants offense produced more runs or if the bullpen did its job in a handful of his starts. Arizona Brandon Webb is 15 4 with a 3.04 ERA, while the Reds Edinson Volquez is 13 4 with a 2.71 ERA. And if you didn you at least thought about it. With an early four run deficit, it just seemed hopeless with this year uninspiring Giants lineup, and sure enough, the team was shutout for the second game in a row. I curious: With the Giants on its way to its fourth straight losing season, what keeps you watching? Or rather, what will keep you watching through the end of the season?

I think your notion of "choice"   choosing boob jobs or high heels or self starvation  shows the limits of the liberal subject on which you base your claims of Western liberation. To the extent that Westernized women "choose" a facelift some Muslim women "choose" a burqa. It is interesting how within Liberalism the moment a subject chooses that which we find revolting, we deny them the ability to choose  marking them as or or I am not supporting the burqa (or the boob job)  just pointing out that "choice" is a very complicated and highly questionable basis for your claims to liberation..

I consider the second option as the backup plan if I don find anything in Aliexpress.

With the Escape Hybrid, Ford becomes the third player in the auto industry's high stakes powertrain poker game. The pioneer of the technology in North America was Honda Motor Co.

But Ford could have the upper hand with a functional SUV, the vehicle of choice in the North American market. The Escape's "full" hybrid system, like Toyota's next generation Prius and unlike Honda's partial hybrid systems, will give it an edge as well.

The owners of many tracks   along with ghost tracks that now offer only simulcast racing   are hoping to survive long enough for states to let them drop the facade of dog racing altogether and just run casinos.Lawmakers, mindful of the interests of deep pocketed casino operators who don't want the unfettered competition, seem to have other ideas.Last year, West Virginia lawmakers rejected a bill pushed by one of the state's two dog tracks to cut its licensing fees by more than half and to reduce the minimum number of race days.Two months ago, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad signed a bill that will shutter one of the state's two tracks by 2016.Florida, which in 1931 was the first state to legalize wagering on greyhound racing, opted against a measure in its most recent legislative session that would have allowed tracks to keep poker and slots and ditch the racing.

A second group would have recyclables picked up weekly. A third group   and this is where the controversy comes in   would have recyclables picked up weekly, but also would have regular trash picked up once a week instead of twice a week, as happens now.Many residents fear the test program will result in the third option being implemented across the entire unincorporated county, resulting in a windfall for garbage company Republic Services because of a reduction in the total number of pick ups, from five to four during a two week period.Then, of course, there also are concerns about stinking garbage.County officials say they simply want to boost the county's dismal recycling rate, and the test runs will allow them to monitor each option for cost and effectiveness.So why haven't the test runs started?Although the county approved the program seven months ago, it depends on neighborhoods volunteering to be recycling guinea pigs.

When we make decisions we regret, it influences our future brain activity, especially in the medial orbitofrontal region, the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, the areas responsible for emotions and emotion related memories in the brain. High stakes decisions increase the activity in these regions, ramping up emotional stress and clouding our attempts at clear headed thinking. Take this example: It's easier to play a high stakes game of poker if you pretend you're gambling for matchsticks instead of recognizing that the chips on the table represent a million dollars.

At my just recently previous job, co worker/manager(he an amazing suck up and got promoted) was a combo platter of lazy/incompetent/liar. When I first started working there, I assisted and mostly cleaned up his messes because ultimately it reflected on the entire IT department. Then I stopped doing that, and he would fail spectacularly yet still recover to save his own ass. Mostly by pure bullshit. Example: He didn follow through with renewing our domain with Network Solutions, host of our MX records, and email shocking stopped delivering. He concocted an DDoS attack story and that is what brought email down, nevermind the fact we are a company of 200 employees with no real front facing servers.

Ancient Hebrews didn't distinguish between sin and germs because people didn't know about germs. They believed that "sin" was very similar to a substance that magnetically drifted towards the temple. They viewed blood like a special cleaning substance, and it would have been self defeating for the blood to have sin. People had to sacrifice for all kinds for reasons that we don't consider morally compromising, like having to sacrifice for being in contact with period blood.

The best players will beat you without looking at their cards. Over time they'll see how you react in various situations, when you bet, when you don't, how long it takes, if you touch your face, sweat, fidget in relation to what's going on in the table. They'll know how likely the other person will be to win compared to you and they'll know how to gain extra clues through raising bets by various amounts to see your reaction. If they think you're uncertain as to whether you can win, they'll easily scare you away with a monster bluff regardless of what they're holding.

Susan Kaye, a therapist working in Philadelphia and Austin, Texas, works with surrogates "below the horizon" for a practical reason   she can't even find certified surrogates in her areas. "I have gotten around it by working with people who are 'body workers,' people I have trained on what I want them to do with clients." "Body work," as Kaye defines it, excludes intercourse, but can include genital touching and genital massage. 
She now has to for something that at the time seemed right, which is extremely rare in warcraft. Usually characters can go on killing sprees and are always justified and face no repercussions, moral or otherwise. To see such a powerful character as Jaina have to grapple with her own choices despite all of them seeming correct up until that point is really cool for me personally. There a lot of neat directions they could take her in now (a meet up with Thrall would be especially interesting), moreso than they could with her were she just a constant peace advocate. Jaina not exactly unique in that regard. However, I find it silly you arguing that her emotions shouldn make sense as it would make it more interesting  it would just be incredibly perplexing and even worse writing if she continued on with her peace tirade after having her entire city and people destroyed. If characters don follow any sort of logic, they stop being interesting because then it DOES seem like the writing team is just pushing it in a direction to sell, despite it not making sense.
OTOH, one of my favourites is Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs from POA. I think that chapter is the one that really sealed my love for the series after I had a lukewarm reaction to the first two books. I never looked back after. 958 points  submitted 12 days ago

Actually, the social psychological evidence is not new. years ago a series of experiments showed that most people lose all moral grounding when put in conditions where hurting another human being is seen as the "right" thing to do. For instance, in 1961, in response to the Eichmann trial, Yale social psychologist Stanley Milgram conducted his now infamous experiments on ordinary people who were instructed to administer electric shocks on strangers. they mostly willingly did it, without any hostility or anger toward the strangers. conclusion was that:

The phone rings. It's Laura calling to tell me he has made more threats. "He says he is going to 'check up' on the place. We are trying to convince him this is a bad idea." She goes on about him and how if he keeps this up we will have to go to a safe house again. I hate those safe houses. Then she says,' We are trying to find him a permanent therapist who can make the decision about hospitalizing him or putting him on meds.' My thoughts are,' why haven't you done this yet?'
