Do not put words in my mouth. If you are asking me to not presume to know Sam Hyde, do not presume to know me. I actively did not call him a Nazi or a white supremacist. I said that, functionally, it does not matter whether he is or not because the shitty thing that he did supported those groups. If Sam Hyde wants to have his cake and eat it too, wants to have his opinions be confusing and nebulous and also wants to contribute to groups he disagrees with, that his right. He can do that. But the only thing I definitely know about him is that he made that donation and I don have to spend another second pondering or considering every possible nuance of his decision to know that I disagree with it. If he was trying to make a point, there were tons of other and better ways to do so. If he just made a mistake, fine. But the position and mindset he was in when he did the shitty thing that he did in no way absolves him of that shitty thing.

There are actually very few mechanisms by which this could occur. Like rabies, the pathogen could alter the function of its host's nervous system by infecting nervous tissue, or it could manipulate the endocrine system by directly messing with hormones, or a combination of the two.

Das ist tatschlich keine unbliche Verhaltensweise wenn es um gestrtes Essverhalten geht. Deswegen wrde ich es nicht als "eine der dmmsten Sachen die man jemals gehrt hat" einordnen.

But as I stated up top people are dumb, and many have decided to just take a loose battery and throw it in their pocket with change and keys. Well, as with literally any battery, if a conductive point is touching both the positive and negative point, this will cause the battery to begin draining electricity through those items.

There are different approaches to classifying religion, with the recognition that there are cultural phenomena (like Confucianism or nationalism) that we might argue about. The favored approach today is to say that religions tend to share a group of characteristics, including some reference to a transcendent reality (beyond the material world), practices and rituals of worship, moral codes, placing importance in sacred objects and places, shared stories, and so on. The example of LOTR seems to be defining a possible religion based on a text, but that is only one dimension of what we tend to call religion.

My point is that for people who have the skills to establish businesses profitable enough for them to join a 1 million buy in Euro cash game, or professional gamers who play games that involve similar skills, poker is not going to be difficult for them to understand on a deep level.

It turns out that emotional campaigns in general generate a wider range of desirable business effects, each of which plays its part in improving profitability. But they excel in one noteworthy area: reducing price sensitivity, and hence strengthening the ability of brands to secure a premium in the marketplace (or, in the current economic climate, to hold firm on pricing). For most brands, clearly the impact on the bottom line of a 1% increase in pricing is much greater than of a 1% increase in volume sold, so this is a particularly important strength..

But isolating the troubled business of SNC wouldn be as straightforward as the division of Gap and Old Navy, and would require some creativity to manage the rights and desires of all stakeholders, according to multiple M specialists who spoke on condition of anonymity because their firms may do, or have done, business with SNC. Even if it were to successfully conceive such as split, the good business might also have to change hands, one suggested.

Naturally forest fires would deliver much needed nutrients back into the soil which facilitates new growth AND prepares the ground by eradicating the low lying shrubs/brush so new plants can get sunlight. Unfortunately, lack of fire is NOT natural so while we protect ourselves from harm of our structures and personal items it really does damage the ecosystem as the natural process would have killed ticks/eggs and also facilitated some new growth in forests.

The Trevor Daley trade was objectively not good. We gave up a 50 point player who had led us to 3 Cups (admittedly an older player), and a top defensive prospect for a 4th line forward and a d man who made little to no impression in 29 games. Rob Scuderi sucked worse too. Sharp had a huge year with Dallas and Stephen Johns is now a 25 year old starting d man who is probably better than at least 3 guys on our current d line. Garbutt played half a season and added no value. Daley and his subsequent trade added no value. We lost two starters for two players gone after the season. That objectively a bad trade.

The story goes like this: humanoid ish Martians (from a green Mars) arrive on Earth in a threatening convoy of unknowingly sophisticated spacecraft, who may or may not be up to no good. The protagonist/narrator is ready for an invasion if there was one, even though the visitors possess weapons of enormous power; he assumes an assertive, offensive position, and seemingly with the question in the wind of what in the world these Martians were doing here, engages them. He had the tools for the fight, having invented a supercomputing super intelligent computer that had unearthed (so to speak) unknown fields of mathematics which led to the creation of "the ultimate, definitive equation of all matter" that told us how to completely destroy matter by "releasing energy from atoms". It also led to the creation of anti gravity, "total matter" energy, distintegrating rays, and of course atomic power, among other punchy sci fi things.

I struggled with getting help. It was a long and difficult task that I did without any support or help. More than once I gave up. For someone who already has social anxiety, to be told "get help, for real" rings with the same insincerity as telling depressed people to "stop being sad". As a side note, I also have depression.

I hardly believe it has any more free will than the others. And if a being has no capacity for free will, but only acts out its inherent nature (regardless of reality), can it truly be considered a sapient entity? The only time the Ruinous Powers displayed any sense of self will was when they banded together against the Emperor for the briefest of time. And even that is somewhat dubious, since they went back to acting out their natures rapidly.

Like nearly all of popular culture, began in the hurly burly of the Victorian age. Industrialization, the creation of a large working class in opposition to a newly powerful middle class, a new mass culture of consumption, and a system of racial and national hierarchies within an empire created the perfect climate for burlesque, a working class entertainment in which all rules could be broken for comic effect and profit.

I also went through the same conundrum and the consensus with everyone I knew was that it was normal for the landlord to ask for it when trying to find a new tenant. People walk into rental offices and want to see new apartments then and there so there's not always time for making an appointment, especially if it's a smaller place. If the real estate agent tells them "Sorry but you'll have to wait to see this place tomorrow when the renter is home" then they'll usually just ask to look at other places or visit another realtor, which is bad for your landlord who wants to find someone to replace you ASAP. It's all about timing.

Turn the heat up to medium high and sautee all this for a few more minutes until you see a sear on your veggies.Now add your toasted grain back to the pan, add water or stock, cover with a lid, and simmer on low heat or medium low heat until it gets cooked.When cooked, garnish with lots of cilantro or diced scallions or toasted chopped almonds or all of the above!Because the grain is toasted and the veggies are seared separately, the texture will be a whole lot different than a clumpy soggy mass. The grains would be separated and the dish overall would have a lot more texture and "cooked/seared" flavor.Instead of dry toasting, you could also add some oil and sautee it.While academia admittedly has many large flaws and I absolutely didn't have a fun time overall, I do think it was a really amazing learning experience and I think it achieved the goals of the program.

What I learned is, sometimes the plan we set out with isn the plan we end up executing. Markets shift, our personal lives change, and new opportunities transform what we once thought was best for us.

Now, if the Ts owned you in the pistol (like 3 or more survived), then it closer.

That said I was surprised to see the atomic bomb referenced in a comic in 1940 (book five years before the Trinity test): "The Atomic Bomb, Lucky Bird, Flier of G2"1 definitely suggests a bomb of high power, which so far as I can determine from my non existent comic book expertise seems to be the earliest of its kind. The very intriguing aspect of the story is that it shares an interesting coincidence with the Real Thing. They weren planning to use their non existent bomb though they did plan to demonstrate it, that bombing 10 labeled secret sites to display its effectiveness. beneath each labeled targets that would be ignited by the 10 pounder and thus make that shell look like a lot more than what it was.

This movie utterly wasted Nick Fury. In what way is this an adequate background for the Nick Fury character? How, from this movie, can we discern how he earned his place at the head of SHIELD? He doesn show any great talent or skill or have any great achievements here.

There always a risk with crafting cards, its just how it works.
Rewording your statements to say "Only women can bear children" or "Only men can inseminate women naturally" is wrong if you accept that trans women are women and trans men are men. If you accept that, if you believe you should call trans people by the proper pronouns, if you think that for non medical purposes we should identify trans people as the gender they identify with, you will inevitably include people in the category of who have vaginas and ovaries and people in the category of who have penises and testicles. If you going to be inclusive in that regard, you might as well be willing to be accurate in your language to include the 2.1 million men and women for whom statements like have penises and have vaginas simply aren necessarily true..

Data disposal Get rid of data you don need. A big question businesses should ask is whether they really need all the data they have collected. Develop a data minimization plan and dispose of data not needed. The plan should include storage and retention schedules. McPhail believes this is the best protection for data breaches. myth out there is if we have a lot of data and we keep it, then one day we will find a way to use it, she says. that may or may not come true, but what it does is open yourself up to risk. There are different ways to accomplish this, but the plan must include assessments, auditing and tracking to effectively monitor what happens in your IT system, including third party data. McPhail strongly urges companies to work with security experts that can regularly update and test systems through penetration testing solutions. By doing this, you stay on top of the security threat. will always be malevolent actors who want to get in, she adds. the problem before the bad guys do. forget the basics, such as patch management. The WannaCry attack proved that updating the security posture through free patches is essential.

With a starting MSRP of $79,900, the AMG E43 is priced to compete with similar performance oriented luxury sedans which include the Jaguar XF S and BMW M550i. Though both are strong performers, especially the M550i with its twin turbo V8 engine, but neither one can quite match the richly appointed cabin nor polish of the Mercedes. An E63 is more of a thrill, and an E400 would make a better laid back cruiser, but for balancing sportiness with comfort, few others can beat the well roundedness of this package..

At my first cousins house, I went into his garage to visit his dogs, he has two and his sister (who lives with at his house) also has one; they aren allowed in the house when guests are over and they are entertaining, so they stay in the garage with the door ajar so they can go outside. When I entered the garage I noticed that in one of the dogs bowls there was a small turd, clearly dog poo, in one of the bowls. Over the course of the visit, I learnt that one of the dogs pooed in the house over night and my cousin is now forcing the dog to star at this turd in it food bowl all day as punishment. He has an almost three old son and a one year daughter, another baby is on the way. So it got me thinking that if this is how he treats and punishes a smaller creature of lesser intelligence who breaks a house rule, what is he going to do when his kids act like kids and inevitably step out of his line ?

I will never understand Michael and Jeremy objection to Always Open. They say it because they had one sex partner so everyone will know who they talking about, which I understand and would be fine with if both of them hadn already said tons of graphic sex stuff on Off Topic. What the difference? It also kind of bugs me that everyone categorizes Always Open as "the sex podcast" when it much more interpersonal stuff in general and there have been lots of episodes where the guest sex life doesn get brought up at all, including, to the best of what I can remember, both of Gavin episodes and possibly Ryan Just seems like a weird double standard to me.

Advantageous and manipulative people. This one particularly grinds my gears, and I find it a terrible and weak character trait. I'm not really talking about very serious things, just little instances where people take advantage of kindness, or lack of aggression. Like assholes who get angry or impatient with passive people, not necessarily because of any wrong doing, but because they aren't threatened if they act aggressively. Or people who are rude to people who are polite, it doesn't make sense to me. If someone is passive or quiet, treat them in that way, if there's something wrong, just politely tell them, as that is how they would do it to you. These people are cowardly, and I'd assume don't amount to much. You can see these people admire power, supremacy and hate, and it's a very toxic way to live. Observing this made one of my life mantras. Be a good person to good people, and be a cunt to cunts.

The argument that occurs in the United States, for instance, where there's this culture of blame: 'it's not my fault, it's someone else's fault' or 'I've got an illness and I can't help myself'.

I recently got lucky and picked up a secondhand casting pot, mold, and all the .45 LC dies for like $50. If I can scrounge up wheel weights or other scrap lead, I practically making bullets for free. Primers and powder is 10 cpr or less. Even buying off the shelf bullets, you can reload .45 LC for 25 cpr or less.
