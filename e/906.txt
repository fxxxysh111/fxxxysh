SHE LET HIM IN AND LEFT US ALONE "TO TALK" IN HER KITCHEN. This guy would not shut up for over two hours constantly asking me out while I said no, then asking again and talking about why I should say yes. Fuck man.

The "Blumine" itself deserves mention, since it is so rarely performed as part of the work. Its simpler orchestration, lyrical calm, and soft glissandos make it sound stylistically different from the other movements. Yet Wittry read it with a freshness and charm that absolutely identified it with the rest of the material. It owes much of that charm to some lovely instrumental solos, notably by trumpeter Larry Wright, oboist Megan Marolf, and clarinetist John Schwartz.

If I were you, I work on retraining the command "Monty" but also stop using his name for anything else. If you want him to come, use your command for come (and remember not to call a dog for anything bad like a bath, better to just lure them to you with a treat than to spoil the "come" command), if you want him to get off of something use them command for "off" or drop/leave something alone, say "drop it"/"leave it" (assuming you already taught these commands). Try not to use his name for anything bad or in a harsh tone.

There like literally a million other things on that list that would have lead to a Gore presidency as well.

I think the extra room is an elegant solution! It's no surprise that casual folks want to try out whatever decks are hot or strong, even if they aren't technically competitive players; and I agree, certain "OP" deck archetypes tend to run rampant after all, people want to win! So maybe adding another category, even something as cheesy as "Trying New Things," would help a great deal.

Finally, go on poop patrol. As unpleasant at it may sound, your dog's stool is a clue to her health. A healthy dog's stools are small, firm, and moist. Dry, hard stools that cause your dog to strain on elimination may be a sign your dog isn't getting enough water, or it may be a hint of another dietary or health problem. Squiggly, rice shaped segments in the feces indicate worms. It's not unusual for an occasional stool to be loose or liquid or to contain mucous or even a tinge of blood. But diarrhea, straining, or mucous  or blood tinged stool lasting more than two days should prompt a visit to the vet. If the elimination problem is accompanied by other signs   fever, vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea   call the vet immediately.
If ads were different colors on different subs, that might confuse normal users. And making an entire color off limits is pretty restrictive, if you blocked only the exact color then you could still use a shade similar to it, and if you block all similar shades then mods could no longer use an entire category of colors. If promoted posts were a mute shade, like a light gray ish blue, I think that could probably work without restricting mod color options..

This sounds stupid but I totally sympathize with Colton here because I had a similar situation a few years ago when I went on a beach outing with a few friends and my on again off again bf/ex and I realized on the ferry ride back to shore/our parked car that my bf/ex and one of my friends were more than just "friends."

I think it really tough to be a female poker player (although there are some advantages), especially when confronting belligerent and rude male players where the jabs/needles can be extremely personal/offensive and where you are pretty powerless if the floor isn on top of their shit. 
For example, ask the children to help you figure out the following problem: "5 turtles crawled onto a giant rock, but then 1 got too hot, so he decided to go for a swim.

Absolutely it is possible, that doesn mean they should automatically be arrested. I of the opinion cops need to actually prove someone needs to be arrested for a DUI. If they were just driving erratically they can give them a ticket; a DUI is for an actual DUI. We definitely don know if that the case here.
But I see a lot of comments from black folks who are not crazy about Asian rappers showing love to their culture.

Most chemical substances have a half life in the body which can be measured. This is the result of the balance between absorption by the body and elimination from the body. To not go into too much detail, when a drug is consumed, it gets absorbed by the body (through the stomach or the intestines, depending on the med) and then either a)does its thing where it needs to in the body and then gets changed by the body for elimination, or b)gets changed by the body first, then does its thing, then gets eliminated. These changes are too complicated for ELI5, and there are many different change types. However, the drug is then eliminated by the body.

The white Southerner, you can say one thing he is honest. He bares his teeth to the black man; he tells the black man, to his face, that Southern whites never will accept phony "integration." The Southern white goes further, to tell the black man that he means to fight him every inch of the way against even the so called "tokenism."

The optimal exploitive strategy should still be very close to GTO. The distinction I want to make is that GTO, by definition, is inherently non exploitive (while exploitive should have roots in GTO).

All of the "non luck" choices you put into making the correct decision to extract maximum value or lose minimally was a product of your birth, genes, parents, environment, and subconscious; "you" have almost no part in any of that.

There are several reasons a person can get thinner or get thin on one side. A few reasons: you are automatically thinner due to parting to one side. There is less hair on that side.

Or get a protective silky bonnet from the beauty supply. Also it can be from elastic bands when you put up your hair. Think of your hair as a fine fabric. Like an expensive fabric.

Schools are pushing them to college but are often times not elaborating on that aside from "follow your passions", which often times results in people living in poverty until they give up on their passions. Schools need a mandatory detailed thorough class where they exclusively prepare the students on succeeding past high school whether it be college or something else..

A formulation of magnesium aspartate hydrochloride known as Magnesiocard has been shown to invoke mood stabilizing effects in patients with severe rapid cycling bipolar disorder in one open study label (16).

That's why storing these products are definitely safer than the others. In the other hands, the players and fans have got the idea of the latest trend in this game from the amount of sales made everyday in a poker store. That's why the complementary system has allowed the users all the way out to make the popular purchases and some products like The Queen Faces Poker Card Protector have become the hot favorites available in the market.

SaunaSpace uses incandescent lamp technology. This is one of two main differences between ourselves and Joovv, who use panels of LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). The crux of their argument against us is that incandescence is an ineffective method of providing PhotoBioModulation or PBM, especially in comparison to their LED panels. In support of this argument, Joovv repeatedly cites the research of Dr. Michael Hamblin. Dr. Hamblin is a renowned subject matter expert in PBM and has been named in countless PBM literature, review articles, and scientific studies. He also happens to be on Joovv's scientific advisory board.

White neighbors took a bit to warm up to me because of issues in our parking lot that mattered to him (and me eventually but largely him) and having a very pregnant wife didn help.

They occasionally had weekend parties but nothing overly loud and it almost always ended at a reasonable time considering it was the weekend. They were always friendly to me, they got a puppy and i had a dog so we had a lot of conversations about the two.

Houston, TX has an insane live scene. The $1/3 games usually play like a $2/5 game and like a $5/10+ on some occasions. Also, games are running as high as $50/100 NLH and $25/50/100 PLO with a $150/300 mix game that runs occasionally. Houston is also centrally located with a major airport for easy access to other parts of the country, Vegas flights are $150 or less round trip, and Mexico City is $150 200 round trip for traveling for WCOOP, SCOOP, etc. Cost of living is a lot less than LA or London but probably a bit higher than Vegas.

It could be a national security threat to actually leave them in these camps where they could be radicalized and, you know, left to languish with a very uncertain future." essentially, though isis is on the verge of defeat, leaving these people for dead instead of repatriating them and having them stand trial can be viewed as setting ripe conditions for more extremist islamic activity.

How about we guess the reason for this and all such "rampages" is an insecure masculinity? As any gender theorist will tell you, masculinity is fragile.

These are rare; a Royal will come only once every 40,000 hands and a Straight Flush once every 9000 hands, on average. Because we're dealing with averages in a random game, there's nothing to stop you from getting a Royal on your very first hand, but it's not likely to happen. And the short term lack of such hands alters the return you can expect when you play, say, 1000 hands of video poker, which is two or three hours of gaming.

Belgian director Bouli Lanners brings us his third feature length film, "The Giants," about three youngsters spending a summer in rural Belgium on their own. With their mother out of the country, teenage brothers Seth and Zak fend for themselves, surviving on dwindling funds and living in their deceased grandfather's country house. One day, while driving around the countryside, they meet 15 year old Dany, and a friendship quickly blossoms among them. 
They are actually increasingly on the rise and becoming an endemic problem in many cities precisely because they're so fast to breed and hard to get rid of. There's a great post on /r/bedbugs (on mobile so can't link) about how we were actually almost rid of them in the 70s thanks to pesticides that in turn were also incredibly toxic to humans (edit: caveat that, as pointed out below, the toxicity was first and foremost to birds, and less critically so to humans) and thus were removed from the market, and now bed bugs are coming back with a vengeance. Overuse of only semi effective pesticides is also causing them to build resistances through thicker shells, so one of the best treatments nowadays is heating the entire building up to over 120F and then leaving desiccants (dust that dries them out until they are nothing but little shreds) and residual pesticides to catch any that managed to dodge the heat..

The real value of the Post series is that the facts and figures coming out might shame politicians in Washington to investigate and possibly limit some of these excesses. real shift in American priorities and spending would require a lot more than facts and figures. would require a revolution.

He behaves very destructively. For instance, he's about to become ex boyfriend. He was in a bad mood and it had nothing to do with me. He went out and without thinking about what he was doing or me, he cheated. We agreed to work through it and because I was clearly upset, he couldn't handle the pressure and drama from me so he went and asked another girl for her number. He didn't do anything just told me he needed someone to talk to drama free. He's impulsive and distructive. He even minimally pushed me the other day. Hence my leaving him. But right now I'm just looking for advice to help him.
Proponents of the game state that the effects of the televised tournaments toward society are positive. Enough to where a person can find "family nights" for playing being offered by organizations promoting the game. Many of the present day champions have stated that they learned how to play from ages as young as 5 from their parents or relatives at home. Kids and teenagers with guidance can learn how to plan strategy, manage money, solve complex problems and understand the psychology of human beings. But every coin has two sides. A concerned number of people are voicing the opinion that the creation of gambling addicts is taking place. More and more land based and online casinos are taking this seriously by offering help for gambling addiction and the creation of new programs for assistance for those who have problem issues. Having help available for players will become increasingly important as the enthusiasm of the game goes forward.

My guess is that you are a weak post flop player based on your stated grievances. If you are upset that you get called when RFI then you are probably playing poorly in post flop. Being 3 bet is rough, but being called is exactly what you want when RFI for most of your range. If you are just trying to induce folds by RFI a hand like AJo then you need to re evaluate what kind of player you want to be.

Whether your players like the rule and whether you should use it is besides the point. I was simply providing a critique of it from a mechanical perspective. It increases variation and swings in combat even more than critical hits already do. This has the unintended effect of reducing players (and the DMs) ability to predict and plan for combat and making combat less tactical. If you okay with that then all is well.

In 1732, aromatic waters were further refined into cologne when Giovanni Maria Farina of Cologne, France, took over his uncle's business. Aqua Admirabilis, a lively blend of neroli, bergamot, lavender, and rosemary in grape alcohol, which has a distinct fruity scent, was used on the face and also treated sore gums and indigestion. Soldiers dubbed it "Eau de Cologne," meaning Cologne water, after the town, and the name cologne stuck to all perfumed waters since then. The rumor was that Napoleon went through several bottles a day, an endorsement that made the cologne so popular that 39 nearly identical products were created. A half century of law suits against these illegal knock off colognes followed.

It's best not to disagree with people who wield sharp scissors near your head, but in this case, the stylists are wrong   a haircut has no effect on how fast your hair grows. Whether you trim it or not, hair grows about half an inch (1.3 centimeters) every month [source: Foss]. That growth rate won't speed up if you take more hair off the bottom, and if you're trimming off more than that each month, then you cut off all the new growth. The only factors that have been proven to affect the rate at which hair grows are genetics, hormones and diet [sources: O'Connor; Monsma].

Letting some of them get away is what started this bullshit race to the bottom, it called game theory and its why we have laws.

El Cangrejo, which translates in English as "the crab" (the neighborhood's streets spread out in a way that is reminiscent of a crab and its claws), was founded in the 1950s by the local Jewish community. At the time, it was the most modern and exclusive neighborhood in Panama City. In time, the Jewish population mostly relocated (to the Punta Pacifica and Costa del Este neighborhoods), and El Cangrejo evolved to become more diverse. The founders' impact in the neighborhood is evident still, though, in the many memorials to Albert Einstein (an ethnic Jew) in and around the area, including a giant statue of Einstein's head and a plaza and a clinic named after him.

Female Common Buzzards are larger than the males. They nest in trees and lay up to three eggs over a period of a week. Both parents spend time incubating but the male fetches most of the food while the female stays with the eggs for most of the time. The eggs hatch after about a month, and the chicks can fly at about the age of 50 days. They are fed by their parents for at least some of the time until they are about three months old. The oldest Common Buzzard known to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) was 28 years old.
