3. Pub Street. You can really come to Siem Reap and not be part of the carnival atmosphere at Pub Street scams and all! There is some fantastic street food available here, as well as good bars and restaurants serving Khmer BBQ, which is a must try when in Cambodia! Although you may see a few scams along the way, everybody seems to enjoy their days (and nights) spent relaxing in the steamy weather!. 
Under federal rules, prosecutors are required to notify people when their conversations are picked up on wiretaps on someone else's phone. Such intercept letters are typically sent out at a late stage in an investigation, but Jeffrey Lindy, a former federal prosecutor and veteran defense lawyer in Philadelphia, cautioned that charges, if any, could be months away given the complexity of the investigation.

If there isn as much content, then the boost isn as useful since there little point in accruing extra gold.

Tall guys have more trouble putting on mass relative to short guys insofar as the muscle is distributed over a larger frame (like you said) which means for a 6 foot guy to look as ripped as a 5'8" guy he would be carrying more total muscle mass which would require a larger calorie intake for both initial growth and upkeep. That said that's super subjective/weird if you think about it.

Unfortunately, I think with how your mom acts, you'll have to prepare for the possibility that she is going to justify her actions as "just parenting." She may say it's just how she does things. She's already said things were different for her, and maybe she had a moment of clarity but sometimes that's not enough. She might buckle down twice as hard on what she says and it's going to suck really bad.

If you are able to double up early in a tournament, it not only gives you extra chips, but it also can be a tremendous psychological advantage by having a large stack. As you go deeper into the tournament, the larger the stack you have, the more you can force your opponents with fewer chips to lay down their hands instead of risking all of their chips against you.. 
King and his soon to be former wife, Shawn Southwick King, and their two children, I cannot help but ask the following question: What if Joan Rivers married someone nearly three decades her junior and then had children with him? certainly possible for Rivers to have children still through the marriage of modern love and modern technology.Given that Shawn was 50 when they married in 1997 and King was 76, they too could have rented a poor woman womb in order to have children.

But it sounds like you are asking about whether it okay to share a news article (for example) that uses Facebook or Disqus to run their comments section? Our rule against linking to social media is to protect users anonymity, and the things we remove under this rule include people sharing unedited screenshots of their family Facebook conversations or blogs that have a bunch of identifying information. Honestly, I can think of a time when we removed a news article just because it had a comments section (except in this case of an article bringing out the estranged parents in the comments, which happens every so often). I happy to check with the other mods in case they have a different opinion, but your example feels like an edge case that we wouldn remove unless there was something else obviously problematic [EDIT: for example, if it broke our drive by diagnosis rule].

Your Life Moments
I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902 1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

It still has some significant glitches/issues but it sounds far better than my initial series of attempts at filtering the 2ch version before I realized I had the 5.1 audio and moved to that. I haven tried running audio ID against the newest sanitized versions but I doubt it produce anything better at this point.

Some therapists are experienced enough to be able to see through them and Dx them and this can be massively threatening to a narc's sense of invincibility. They rarely admit such a Dx to others. Or, they go in the opposite direction and totally embrace their Dx because it gives them a universal excuse for any sort of crap narc behavior. No therapist would ever sanction this, but all of a sudden, every tired excuse gets assigned to "their diseeeeeaaaaassse". And then there's that old narc favorite whinge: "But the therapist saaaaaiiiid" as a one size fits all solution to all criticisms. Therapy with narcs is almost always a losing proposition. At best, they'll simply refuse to be honest and avoid any real work. But at worst, they will dig right in to the delicious opportunity to weaponize therapy, and learn a whole new lingo, skill set and techniques of furthering abuse, and avoiding consequences.

Oh that's nothing. I evicted my last tenants when I found they were keeping two dogs in cages in the basement (in their own piss and shit) and extra people were living with them in places that weren't even legal rooms. They were hoarders. They decided to throw half their shit into the state protected wetlands behind the house (still my property, and I would have been fined for it during the yearly state inspection). It took weeks of bleach treatments to get the dog smell out of the cement floor in the basement. We lugged truckloads of stuff out of the wetlands and had to pay to dump it all. All of the carpets were replaced and they also left the propane tank (which they were responsible for filling at the end of the lease) bone dry. The security deposit didn't come close to covering the damage. I ended up selling to my next tenant and he even still found some stuff buried in the wetlands when he went to do work on the place. Thankfully he was very chill about it.

Milana zette ons daarna tegen een uur of 6 weer af, na een metro rit, bij Kamergersky Per, waar we op een terrasje een Virgin Monjito dronken (dat woord is hetzelfde in het Russisch). We hadden een drukke en leerrijke dag gehad met onze gids, maar waren eerlijk gezegd ondertussen wel blij dat we een beetje tijd voor onszelf hadden, zonder al die verhalen over architectuur en dichters. Op weg naar een geocache passeerden we weer bij het Manege Plein en de Alexander Gardens, maar daarna volgde nog een lange omweg om te trachten het drukke kruispunt voor het Kremlin over te steken. Een half uur later (ik denk echt dat dat niet overdreven is) stonden we eindelijk aan de andere kant van de straat bij de geocache, waarbij we weer ruimschoots de kans gekregen hadden om de politie hier te observeren, heel actief in Moskou om auto van de baan te halen (blijkbaar zoeken ze gestolen wagens).

Witch was not burned alive as they used to do, Morris said as she translated the oddly boastful end of the article.

I don think this is true. The reason for such a high number of cases within the church is because the church attracts pedophiles. What I mean is that potential sexual predators can see that priests and other religious leaders have a position of power over children that is extremely easy to abuse.

Hemp is great for inserts, but keep in mind it needs to be UNDER something like bamboo or cotton that absorbs quickly   hemp holds a ton, but is really slow when it comes to absorption. Hemp prefolds aren worth the trouble IMO. Because it more of a felt type material, you can use any fasteners except pins (or built in snaps if you have a fitted). Microfiber is ok. It holds a lot of liquid and cleans fairly easily, but it doesn hold onto liquid the way any natural fiber does.

Danke schn :)You really don need to worry about stereotypes. There are a lot of Asians in Berlin, you won stand out in the least, and 99% of people won even look twice. It possible that many will automatically assume you an actual Asian immigrant instead of an American, so you might have to tell them, but it really doesn make a difference either way. The worst scenario I can come up with is that someone might ask you about e sports or Gangnam Style. Don take offense. It stupid, but they don mean it in a bad way.

Typically you can find the higher payback video poker machines on a bar top in the casino, but this is not always the case.

I actually just ran a sim in PIO for this flop in BU vs BB this morning. I gave us a 75% Cbet size on the flop and was betting over pairs at a near pure freq. I was experimenting using a flop overbet strategy for IP as well but looked like 75% had a higher EV. AA was the only overpair that checked back at some freq and I think it was 10% or so. So I mean if you want to add in that mix you can but doesn't seem that substantial to me. Turn is a mandatory call, river seems like a fold to me. You didn't butcher this hand by any stretch of the imagination.

But more importantly it kills the unfriendly oral bacteria exacerbating gum disease. I prescribe chlorhexidine for patients who have acute inflammation and generally for patients who have horrible oral hygiene. Most patients use it for several weeks to a month and it really does whip the gums into shape, but I wonder if the oral microbiome normalizes after several weeks? I prescribe it long term for elderly patients who can't brush or floss because of crippling arthritis or because of mental decline and apathy. If they don't use the rinse and because their oral hygiene is so bad, their teeth rapidly decay away in addition to the gum disease. When they lose their teeth and have to get a denture it isn't easy to adjust to and many patients find that they can't eat well anymore which leads to malnutrition which adds to their already declining health. So from this study, I don't know if this is powerful enough evidence to suggest that it not be used at all weighed against it's beneficial effects.

I once asked my therapist this, and in a nutshell, she said, no, there no way to undo any trauma. And probably no way to heal any given trauma 100%. But there a way to get to a place where the trauma doesn actively haunt us anymore. And it possible to unlearn the damaging, non constructive coping mechanisms and patterns that trauma instills. Like kintsugi, the point of therapy is not to erase the damage, but to repair it, and to learn to appreciate the thing for what it is, cracks and all. And therapy does help. Not immediately. Not like magic. But it can significantly improve your quality of life to a point where you not hurting all the time. If you can afford it, though, I would personally recommend upping your therapy attendance to weekly instead of monthly.

Logically, it would seem that it is better to chase in an ODI game, unless there is a likelihood of the pitch deteriorating or slowing down. You would think that knowing the target would help in pacing out the innings, instead of going for too much and ending up with too little as it sometimes happens when batting first. He knows that the bowler will be sweating just as much as him the closer they get to the finish line, and is just as likely as the batsman to lose his nerve and bowl a loose ball. And that when he pounces.

My worst episode was when the water got mixed with the mucos in my throat. I tried to regurgitate the food only to have the thick mucos impede my airway. I thought I was going to aspirate my own mucos into my lungs and die of asphyxiation. At the time I was watching my two young children. I called the fire department. When they got to the door, I answered with bloodshot watery eyes from wretching so hard. I told them what was going on. I was completely blunt and said you are here for my children in case my airway gets blocked and if it does, you get practice on intubating in the field. They were pissed.

But Scalia rejected that view. some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct, Scalia wrote.

They store it in their honey sack, then return to the hive where other worker bees suck it out and chew it, breaking down the nectar complex sugars into two simple sugars called glucose and fructose.

Middle class necessities are different than they used to be (no judgment, standards change and it's hard to buck those standards).

I know there a natural progression to things, and that what I like could have only existed by replacing what had been there before.

Even professionals must play a style that is natural for them, but overall they are far more flexible in reacting to the environment than amateurs. All of which means there are no fixed rules for what percentage of hands "should" be won. At lower stakes, I would say that as a general rule the professionals are winning fewer but bigger pots than the amateur. Occasionally the table is so easy that a professional can overrun it and win the vast majority of pots because the opposition simply fold too much under pressure.
