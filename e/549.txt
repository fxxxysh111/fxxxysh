Eg, in the papi interview, Joey was asking Phil about the mobile app, and Galfond was saying something like "mobile app is a big feature, this will take about as much time as the window resizing feature", which to me kind of demonstrates that he doesn fully comprehend the scope of the projects he talking about. 
In 2016, Kavanaugh reported credit card and personal loan debts of between $60,000 and $200,000. The Trump White House said these debts were the result ofKavanaugh buying baseball tickets for friends who later paid him back, as well as some spending on home improvements. The 2016 debts did not appear on Kavanaugh's 2017 disclosure form because they were either entirely paid off or fell below the reporting threshold.

A lot of people who read the Essig think that Wall Street is basically running the country, and I have yet to see Jamie Dimon on CNBC talking about how we need to cut back on military spending so we can give good healthcare to the poor and improve the health and education of our work force. Despite all our budget problems, military spending is untouchable.

I think that people get this argument all wrong. The argument isn that it isn possible to get out of poverty through hard work and smarts. The argument is that there are systemic issues that make it so only certain groups have to do that. Middle to upper class white people don have to work hard or be particularly smart to stay out of poverty (I am one, although I like to tell myself I am smart and hard working). For people in poverty, it is a huge life changing amount of work and effort, they have to break expectations and do it all without any support. For people who aren poor, it just normal life, it isn particularly hard, they have plenty of support.

Nah, British AI fails in Africa because it like a 14 year old teenage girl, who can make up its mind to where to hold its divisions. It always transports troops between continents and then decides to sit in UK with 40 divisions and 2M manpower. And its colonies do the same thing, so some subs destroy the Allied troops. Hence Italy steamrolls in Africa with 4 divisions. If you actually station some troops in Africa, use your Navy, you can easily take the ports in Ethiopia and Libya.

In a no limit tournament, making just one mistake can knock a player out of the game. No limit also allows many opportunities for better players to bluff opponents out of a hand. Often a player who goes all in (raises with all of his/her chips) is called by someone who doesn't have as many chips. In this case, if the player who started the hand with more chips loses the hand, he/she gets back any amount over what the other player had to start the hand. For example: Player 1 goes all in with $200, and player 2 calls but has only $100. Player 1 loses but gets back $100, and they play out the next hand for the remaining $200 ($100 from player 1 and $100 from player 2) in the pot. (No limit Hold'em is discussed in greater detail later in this article.)

We all know playing against a maniac can be frustrating but invigorating as well. This is one of those situations where my instincts guide me more than my poker calculator software, especially if you are seated near the maniac and you know you're going to be heads up. Check the hand list below for hands that you can add to your tight aggressive play. Holding most of these hands your poker calculator is going to be telling you to fold. Your strategy here should be to re raise the maniac and get him heads up. Call down if you have to but let him know you won't play dead, which is what your software will be suggesting.

Some people think asking questions with "obvious" answers are worth downvotes. Other people are reddit sociopaths. The point is, there is no reason after one hour of a comment existing that you have to be such a dipshit about someone getting downvoted.

There apparently a fourth option that is "secret" but it difficult to believe it involves anything like a real option, where a bunch of bean counters are not sitting around arguing whether we should send 27,303 soldiers to escalate the war or 38, 724. In fact, if these are the "options" then it seems impossible that anyone in the administration is even considering the only ethical and also the only practical option: END THE WAR..

Easy method I wish I had known early: Mash in with 1.75 quarts for each pound of grain, using the Internet to tell you what temp to heat this water to, or use the calculation in Palmer "How to Brew" to figure it yourself. Wait for one hour, and give the mash a good hard stir every 15 minutes. Drain slowly into a pitcher until the wort starts running fairly clear, and pour the cloudy wort from the pitcher gently back onto the grain bed while you run off the wort into your boil pot. When it all in the pot, measure how much wort you have at this point   it should be near half your final target. Then figure out how much more liquid you need in the pot to have the amount you want before boiling, which is approx. 1.5 gallons more than you want in the fermenter. Add that amount of water at 180 degrees, give a good hard stir, and drain it off into the pot. You should have just the amount you need to boil. Ambassador to the county in question, who was the President representative on the ground and who had a direct line to the Secretary, is nobody?

I didn think anything of it and assumed he would had me properly draped, and I didn open my eyes to look down and check because I felt awkward doing that. (I should also mention that he accidentally exposed a little of my areola before in a session many months ago, but when he noticed he quickly moved to cover it back up, so I assume it was just an accident   he didn do that this time.)

"Poker Room"Reviewed October 9, 2012 I go down and player poker in there poker room several times a year from Virginia. I've played in several different poker rooms over the years from Las Vegas to Atlantic City. This poker room for now is all electronic with no live dealers. Some people loves it, while some others hate it. I myself feel that it is ok. I like that you don't have to tip a dealer and the hands go much quicker. The room is upstairs now and kinda out of the way from all the casino action. This poker room is one of the quietest poker rooms that I have ever been in. They have several big screen tv's on the walls and that is it.Ask empressginger about Reviewed September 27, 2012 First timerThis was my first time gambling. It was a fun trip with a bunch of friends. One of the girls that went had been there before so that was a big help. We all had a fun time. There was alot of smoking but I guess that is normal for a casino. The staff was very nice and helpful. None of us won. :( Even though I don't know much about gambling, I had a good time and would go back again.

Right at the start here I like to say I know nothing about the Chicago subway system I would however like to share this little gem on it that I just found. The pamphlet looks unexceptional except for the date, which caught my attention because it is the month/year that the subway opened. The pamphlet also looks like it is a serial of some sort, but it isn just has a bad title. It is slim only 31 pages long but once you get beyond the first few pages of laudatory photos for the movers and shakers the work takes on a semi documentary air, with some compelling images, which were another surprise. Well, the snippet below from an article in The Brooklyn Eagle (January 25, 1867, page 2) in which the agreements were made to start construction of the bridge (commencing in 1869) also included a section about the sale of the bridge from the corporation building it to NYC or Brooklyn or both.

When OLGR assesses individual tax rebates, the audit found that they are "based on minimal evidence" and "there are no procedures in place to provide an objective review". The department told the auditors that a lack of resources meant it was "difficult to conduct a thorough review of the tax rebate returns." There was a "lack of transparency" in how funds were spent in Category 2   which attracts the highest rebate of 1.1 per cent   because there were no guidelines as to how they should be administered. Last year, the guidelines for what money can be spent on were altered to include spending on projects such as club sport, golf courses and bowling greens   and even wages paid to staff to carry out maintenance.

Absolutely nothing. However, the survey states: "Anonymized survey results will be made publicly available under the ODbL 1.0 license when the survey closes." Hopefully any troublesome submissions can be identified after the fact. Furthermore, if I did put some system in place to prevent duplicate submissions, I suspect that people would complain (a) about being tracked, and (b) about the ineffectiveness of such a system.

Our new kittens have stamped across my laptop keys more times than any other surface in the house since they arrived. All they managed to do is bring up the find function and make the alignment of screen portrait rather than landscape (which took ages to fix, because I had no idea it was a thing that could happen and I had to search for a fix with my laptop propped sideways like a book).

Hurtley is a huge fan of white on white. a gorgeous, timeless look, she says. can have fun and create a beautiful, soft feel to any space by layering textures and different whites.

Not sure if this is always a bonus, but I think for this trip for me this time it was: the promotions. During MOST of the hours I played they had a promotion running where they gave out at least $100 and sometimes $200 and sometimes it was $100 and they would draw a random card and it would be another $100 if the card was an ace or a king. The promotion would pick a random table every hour (usually between 8:15 AM and 10:15 PM) and if your table was picked, everyone dealt in the hand got at least $100 (I think it was $200 on Friday and Saturday). Not every table was eligible (like the higher staked games), but all the $1/$3 tables WERE eligible. I haven run the math on a typical EV regarding that promotion, but I hit Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and then on my last day (Tuesday), I hit THREE times. That money was rolled into my buyin and buyout numbers. Regardless if I ran hot, normal, or cold, it rakeback and I grateful for all that I can get.

A triglyceride consists of 3 fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone. It does not pass easily through the cell membrane as it is changed. It also requires two enzyme steps to 'release' its fatty acids. Sometimes because of the structure of the triglycerides the fatty acids are not released but rather stay attached to the glycerol backbone.IF IF IF IF the oil is esterified during the concentration and purification processes the resulting substance can easily enter the body's cell membranes.The esterified molecule has no charge and only requires one enterase enzyme to release the fatty acid.

Nothing i say contradicts this. With F2Ps, it common to sacrifice or at least delay some of the gameplay quality for the sake of it being free, but the restricted color palette severely limits the customization disproportionately to how it uauLLY IA. You might as well not even bother with it before you have the first palette. Essentially, it ok to lock some of the desirable things behind cash, not the necessary things, and whether people like it or not, customization is gameplay and the first palette is necessary for it to be at a even decent system.

State governments face a similar dilemma.

All the World's A StageIn May 1887 Thomas Russell Sullivan's highly influential stage adaptation of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde opened in Boston. British American actor Richard Mansfield had acquired the US stage adaptation rights and hired Sullivan to write the play in a way that would allow him to play both Jekyll and Hyde. This changed the plot considerably so that Dr Jekyll is younger than in the novel, has a wider social network and is engaged to be married. After enjoying considerable success in Boston and New York, on 4 August, 1888 the show came to London. Three days later, on 7 August, the first of the Jack the Ripper murders took place and some newspapers blamed the play, even hinting that Mansfield was the murderer, using his theatrical skill and knowledge of make up and costume to escape detection.

Wasteland, Baby! taps into a mood of contemporary political malaise, situating several songs on the edge of some ruinous, perhaps climate related catastrophe, but the album also stars the moaning loverboy who covered Destiny's Child's "Say My Name" in January.

I have tried talking to parents who let their children put their wet, muddy boots on bus seats, or touch the produce at the grocery store with their visibly dirty hands, or run around the grocery store and almost knock elderly people over. Never once have they reprimanded their child. Instead they told me, at best, to mind my own effing business and at worst, show the child that they can be as antisocial as they want and be verbally disrespectful to others.

Eight months ago, I met the first guy I've had a real connection with since getting out of a four year relationship. We really get along and have a strong connection   or so I think. He was moving out of the country in a few months, so we decided to keep things "casual" because of the bad timing with him leaving   or so I thought. A couple of months later, I found out that he has been in a long term and long distance relationship for years. I've always thought something was off with how secretive he was. I don't know why I haven't ended it; I know I should have the minute I found out.

And his thoughts were not of the good work he had done.
