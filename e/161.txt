The A comes on the flop, since charlie is holding the other A, there is exactly 1 case combo of AA from his opponent. If his opponent does not have AA, he will be chopping with oddly played limp 4 bet AK as far as value goes. There is no reason to raise this flop because it will just fold out all his opponents bluffs which is why he takes a check call line. They started about 170 big blinds deep and given that the hand was 4 bet preflop, there really is no other line given his stack to pot ratio after the flop but to eventually stack off with his hand here. Its very unlikely that a hand like AJ would have taken this line from his opponent, and even a hand like JJ rarely takes this line. If his opponent did do something bizarre and spazzy, the natural play is to check call and allow a spazzy opponent to bluff the rest of the chips off on the turn whereas raising will just give the opponent a chance to fold his bluffs.

Then, today, out of nowhere, this "other" user messages me trying to say again that I celebrate rape and said that he deserved it, which of course I did not. I though he was just a drama troll, so I wanted to RES tag him so I knew not to take the bait if I saw his posts anywhere. RES wouldn show the tag, so I went to the list to see all my tags, and found that his username just happened to be right next to original user because their names share the first three letters. I thought that, combined with the fact that they involved in the same exact post, and he brought it up out of the blue, probably means they the same person. IDK for sure, it just would be a big coincidence. Then I see this user post here with the same story, being raped and being a conservative and how "nobody cares", but this time he was raped by a woman.

By forcing your cardiovascular system to pump blood and oxygen continuously throughout your body, aerobic exercise stimulates and strengthens the heart, lungs, and muscles.

So it not really a radical question to ask or ruling to make. It personal preference whether you want to lean tight toward RAW or adjust the rules for more verisimilitude.

However, today I going to try my hand at piecing together something for /r/poker to really help our losing, breakeven, new uNL players. I am fully aware this has been done once before (especially since I will be quoting a lot of his content to really make this a jam packed guide) but it has now been 5 years since writeup on 2p2. What I would like to accomplish with this, is touch on many of the things he did, and add many more, to really aid our new players and players having trouble beating the micros. As mentioned, I will even use some of the content wrote, highlighted in bold to give credit for his writing, although I hear he quit playing so he probably wouldn care regardless. Hopefully that way it easier to combine all of the information rather than me trying to re write some of his concepts and call them my own, which isn necessary. I will also add some links during specific topics to videos I believe these players will find extremely useful. But without further ado, let get into how you can start becoming a winning player and climb through those micros! This will probably be long. veryyyyy long.

Calculating pot odds can help you make this decision. If you do decide to draw, you'll need to bluff until you get the card you need.

Keep a close eye on it and if it herms, pull it. It should have never made it to shelf, it also should have never made it to the "top" shelf. Looks great, smokes alright but isn't very potent. The other LACs were largely unaffected.

8) Excessive Spam. Posting multiple threads a day in excessive use. Took with me all I had saved up to Macau, which amounted to just 7 buy ins for the lowest stakes game, and played like a fish on a heater my first month more than doubling my stash. Thought the run good would last forever, got cocky, and started playing like I was overrolled. Made some really dumb and spewy plays, went on monkeytilt a few times. As a result, my bankroll whittled down to just 5000 HKD (1 buy in) near the end of March. Gut check time. Made myself a promise that I would start playing my A game and give it my all my next session; if I went broke at that point, I'd quit poker for good and go back to school. Sat down at the Venetian at around March 31st noon, played for around 21 hours til 9am the next morning, ran pretty fucking well, and finished the session up 22K. A huge turning point for me, gave me a ton of confidence. Also probably the most stressed out I've ever been lol. Games were nice and soft, but I was a giant fish who had barely any idea what I was doing. I still managed to only lose slightly/break even while 4 tabling 25nl or 50nl for months. That how soft the games were back then.

Hi Barry, the new bar and liquor store called Tipsy Rooster is at the front end of the motel complex and faces the street. People stop by for a beverage on their way to Duval Street which is where all the main bars and restaurants are located. Southwinds is on the quiet side of the island and the bar has not changed that. We have 58 rooms at Southwinds and some of them are a block or two away from the store. Please let us know where you would like to stay when you make your reservation as we make sure you have a quiet place away from the activities of the store.

Right at the start here I like to say I know nothing about the Chicago subway system I would however like to share this little gem on it that I just found. The pamphlet looks unexceptional except for the date, which caught my attention because it is the month/year that the subway opened. The pamphlet also looks like it is a serial of some sort, but it isn just has a bad title. It is slim only 31 pages long but once you get beyond the first few pages of laudatory photos for the movers and shakers the work takes on a semi documentary air, with some compelling images, which were another surprise. Well, the snippet below from an article in The Brooklyn Eagle (January 25, 1867, page 2) in which the agreements were made to start construction of the bridge (commencing in 1869) also included a section about the sale of the bridge from the corporation building it to NYC or Brooklyn or both. Now this is not what the comedy tag referred to of course as this was real, but it is a little amusing to see such a thing in black and white.
The Nazis had this idea of "race" where they wanted people to have as many children as possible (yet only the "right" kind of people in their eyes).

A place to begin to explain Washington's current dysfunctional condition is the basic design of American political institutions, notably, the presidential system that allocates the executive and legislature independent powers. In contrast to a parliamentary system of fused powers, the separation of powers creates a built in, that is, structural, potential for gridlock when each branch is controlled by an opposing party. The Constitution specifies that, in order for legislation to be adopted, a bill must be voted by both houses of Congress and approved by the President. This requirement invites deadlock when opposing parties control different political institutions. Moreover, Congressional procedures further constrain reform. For example, the Senate's current filibuster rule specifies that a super majority   60 of the 100 member body   must support bringing a measure to the floor for a vote. In the House, the Speaker (that is, the leader of the majority party in the chamber) can prevent proposals from being scheduled for a vote. During the recent imbroglio over the fiscal cliff, House Republican Speaker John A Boehner refused to allow the House to vote on a measure passed by the Senate and supported by the President.

Linch: So that's really interesting that an organization very strongly aligned with Effective Altruism principles is fundraising for charities that have relatively little evidential backing.

This isn't to say that those are literally the best charities, of course. But those seem to be the most likely to be the best charities in expectation, given the information that GiveWell  one of the best charity evaluators in the world   is aware of. What do you think is the case for giving to FRI instead of (or in addition to) a top GiveWell recommendation?

I've had clients that are incapable of managing themselves and getting what I need to work on their project in a timely manner, and then expect me to drop everything for them. I've learned to drop those clients. The frustrations and time aren't typically worth the money (and can even cost you potential money from other clients), and usually when a client doesn't have it together it means the resulting project isn't going to be something you'd be willing to show off to get more work. Unless you have the time to spare or you really need the money, I would let this client go. It may feel wrong to leave and I understand that view as I held it myself for far too long, but if they aren't respecting you then there's no reason for you to respect them.

According to Blume, getting the best price in each individual trade is not necessarily every trader top priority. Often, an institutional trader effort to accumulate a large block of a particular stock must be broken into numerous trades. The buyer may be satisfied if some trades are not at the best price so long as the entire block can be bought quickly at a low average price. By emphasizing speed over minor price variations, the trader reduces the risk some event will drive the price up before the block of shares is assembled. institution that is trading a large order is concerned with the ultimate average price, not with the price of each transaction, Blume notes.

I understand the "it was her choice to have kids, not my choice to hear a crying baby" argument but I don buy it. She and her baby have just as much right to the flight as any other paying customer, and if we can make social allowances for a crying baby, then it no wonder our societal birthrates are plummeting. An airplane isn a library nor a hotel; it a mode of transport for hundreds of various types of people, including little babies who likely had their routine disrupted not to mention are sealed in a very dry air environment with major fluctuations in air pressure on sensitive ears.. 
Diaphragm relaxing medication is also an option for some patients.

The video surfaced during a 10 month investigation by Avenatti's office. He told the AP that the person who provided the VHS tape knew both Kelly and the female in the video.
I imagine the reason your comment is being downvoted is because you're parroting that a DO with a 260 is not the same as an MD with a 260. I don't believe this is true simply because the test is standard and scores are what are used for match data.
The Russian translator was also an FBI asset working out of the New York FBI offices. Did Manafort get suspicious and contact the FBI?

So deep undercover, Spider Man couldn't afford to let the gig slip, so he maintained his cover as the tiger Richard (Dick) PARKER, who Pi Patel fucked on a regular basis because he was a lonely adolescent teenage boy, only problem is: they developed a deeper relationship, so when Pi Patel says his final goodbye, Peter Parker (Spider Man) says his catchphrase "you'll always know where to find me.", and so therefore the final scene where Mary Jane says "go get 'em tiger" at the end of Spider Man 2, she is willingly giving Peter Parker permission to don the identity of Dick (Richard) Parker the Tiger for one last booty call from Pi Patel.

I agree with you that it's far wiser to focus on simple economics. It's part of what I was trying to say. But when you are a certain white male and you see black lives matter and affirmative action for not you and female pay, you don't think they care about you at all. You can come away thinking that the party doesn't care about you. And no, what she says In this sub has no effect on the electorate. But it's not hard to find tape of politicians catering to these causes and people saying things like that and never mention something that seems like it's for them. So you might not be overtly racist but you stay home or even vote for orange hitler because Democrats hate white men and do nothing for them but demonize them. That's not true, but politics is about managing perception and that's the perception. Too much of the left is about identity politics and purity. There is too much jargon based criticism and language policing. I didn't support Bernie and voted for Hillary, but his focus on class and not identity grievances, regardless of their validity, helped him with whites. He carried whites overall. And he still carried younger minorities, who are the ones I'm talking about. So you don't lose them by focusing more on class, IMO. You don't have to go Sista Soulja to signal to poor whites that you care about them to. You just make that the focus instead of identity. And those groups still vote for you because they know you have their back, because you aren't talking about Mexican rapists and shithole African countries.
For example, suppose you are playing in a $1 $5 spread limit game, the bet is $2 to you, and you have only $5 chips. Silently tossing a $5 chip out means you call the $2 bet.

In this game the higher the numbers, the more respect you get. Therefore, for the 2004 model year the mid engined S7 has been boosted to 575 horsepower. The S7's motor, an 7.0 liter V8, is loosely based on Ford's NASCAR V8 block, but Saleen has thoroughly re worked the powerplant. The block, heads, and crankshaft are Saleen's own creations, and cast from aluminum and forged steel. There are however fundamentals that have not been changed. For one, the V8 is still a 2 valve per cylinder unit with pushrods   unconventionally old school in the modern day supercar scene.

I agree and don agree. I can see a plausible argument on where this stops but I believe that requesting access to seeing what financial holdings and obligations a one day sitting President might have is important in eliminating candidates who might hold the republic to blackmail. It also displays a reasonable amount of competency that if someone is alright with their own finances they may not be so inclined to trash anothers. 
After a day at Petra, we were windblown and exfoliated! We had heard a lot about a place called Wadi Rum (but having no book, had no idea what it was). It seemed to be about an hour away so we hopped in the Aveo and headed there. Wadi Rum is a nature preserve where they offer tours via camel and 4X4. We didn have time to do that, having booked flights to Beirut for the following day, so we headed back to Wadi Musa, catching a phenomenal sunset along the way.

You use this in conjunction with pot odds, particularly when bluff catching, to try and make the best decision. The point I think you are making is that some people just dont bluff, and that true. Your opponent may only have one value combination, but if they have zero bluff combinations, then it still a fold. 
Petty, rabid, limitless arrogance; shallow, so very shallow comprehension with big, fairly big conclusions.

You are probably correct in that women are not take as seriously, but it depends on the woman. In general, I think women are less aggressive than men. However, I find that women regs that are pretty good players tend to more aggressive and bluff way more than they should. Think Vanessa Selbst, good, but spewy. haha. I played a few times against Danielle Anderson and Samantha Abernathy and on those occasions both were very aggressive overall, but were pushing in and bluffing in some very questionable spots. on an A high rainbow board after he raised 4x pre and barreled all the way?

Also look into sign up bonuses, real money account funding methods, player point programs and the variety of real money tournaments offered so that you are familiar with them when you are ready to begin playing for cash.

The Tzar Bomba was so impractically big that creating a parachute to slow its descent disrupted the Soviet textile industry. If you're wondering why they needed a parachute in the first place, it's because no matter how high you dropped it from, the resulting explosion would reach up into the sky and disintegrate your plane unless you gave yourself some kind of head start.

No one, including Holder, suggests that it is illegal for an individual to play poker on the Internet. And that is as it should be. It is unfathomable that policymakers would tell adults that they cannot enjoy a game of Texas hold 'em   in which the player's ability has direct impact on the outcome   in the privacy of their homes on computers and Internet connections they pay for. Yet these same lawmakers think it's perfectly fine for people to bet on horses or play the lottery, two other forms of gambling. Why the Justice Department feels it can roll the dice and pick one form of gaming to ban over another is beyond me, and it is beyond the millions of Americans who are being denied their hobby and, for professional players, their livelihood.

Another thing to keep in mind when you 3b postflop is balance and polarization. When you 3b here, you rep an extremely polarized range. Essentially only sets, 78s, and bluffs. If you rarely, if ever, 3b bluffing postflop, you range is just so face up.

So we need new techniques to handle 3+ player games, and need to decide how to evaluate performance in these games.That said, all of the techniques we have now appear to work great in 3+ player poker. There are two main reasons for this:1) In poker, people fold early, and the more people that are at the table the more likely you should fold, so in practice most hands become 2 player pretty quickly.2) In poker, there is basically no opportunity to collaborate.

All through college, I studied, played hard, and gambled harder. 
The incident occurred on the day the proposed ordinance was introduced at a county zoning meeting. More than 15 massage business owners attended that meeting, where their attorney, Allen Lichtenstein, asked to meet with county staff and police to address the owners' concerns. The county agreed to Lichtenstein's request and put off a vote until December. It would apply to all such businesses obtaining new permits, but the county would have the discretion to apply the restriction to those seeking renewals as well.

Not that hard to believe honestly. I could shave all of my hair off my body, drive 500 miles from my house without having any electronic device in my car or on me, and pick a target. After that I can follow home them to their neighborhood and kill them with their own kitchen knife then drive home as if nothing happened. Cops would never find me, unless they go through extensive camera security work that would go way beyond 48 hours. The reason why 60% of murders are solved is because 1. The victim knows and has an extensive history with the killer 2. The murder is a heat of the moment killing, which results in a lot of forensic evidence or eye witness accounts 3. Detectives are great at their job.

The amount of waste generated by nuclear energy is massively lower than that of coal and gas power. I talking orders of magnitude difference. Even if it does last effectively forever it won be a serious problem, especially compared to dealing with waste from other sources. I think a big part of why environmentalists dont like it is that it isnt renewable like solar, water, or wind. I think that it would be great if we had efficient means for those energies, but we dont yet. It would not work on a large scale at this point. Nuclear, however, would be a good step on the path to entirely renewable resources, and if it doesnt turn out to be viable to go fully renewable, nuclear is still a thoroughly better alternative to where we are now.

That being said, to my ear, there is a strange consistency. Despite three different people fronting the band over the span of decades, there is a certain mysterious, "other worldly" sound that haunts all the bands work. Whatever you call that quality, it seems hardwired into how each of the band members write music, as it (mostly) follows them throughout their solo careers. It so uniquely Floyd, and a large part of why I love that band.

"Right to work" doesn allow you to fire people for reasons that are illegal under state or federal law. That includes illegal forms of discrimination, retaliation, interference with the exercise of legal rights (such as requesting FMLA leave, or demanding your pay). Since all of these protections exist in some form at the federal level, there is no such thing as a "right to work" state that can fire you under any circumstances without ever facing repercussions. And, no, courts do not blindly accept that you were fired for legitimate business reasons right after you pointed out that your employer wasn paying your wages due.

If people had money they'd spend it, which would keep companies here. Anyway, saying that capitalism has lifted more people up is like saying that slavery improved people's standard of leaving so it was good for them. Capitalism is actually a cheaper form of slavery because you don't have to pay for someone else's living needs, you can make them fend for themselves and only pay as much as need be to keep the fish on the hook. The argument is moot anyway because whether it was beneficial or not capitalism is breaking down, permanently. We can either be ready to help people and support our fellow man and assign only the labor required to keep the society running or we can go the way of the libertarian paradise as featured in Mad Max and continue playing a wasteful property squabbling game until we chew up all the resources on the planet. Your choice.

Honestly, I looked up to her character Sam so much as a kid. Not for the "fried chicken" lines, but because she was a badass and she was tough and a fiercely loyal friend. I was a lot like her as a kid (anger issues, style, even the curly hair) and I thought it was cool to see someone kinda like me. She had her bad moments, but her bad moments were similar to mine (accidentally saying something hurtful, getting too mad too fast) and it helped to see how she dealt with those problems.

TL;DR: where the hell do i put my feet when conventional deadlifting?OP was asking about how Coan did so well compared to taller lifters. The question was phrased in a way that seemed to be asking "why someone who is short is stronger than someone who is taller?" Statistically, short limbed lifters have done better with individual lifts. No one is arguing that being a manlet is the ONLY reason for Coan success, but that is why he does better than tall lifters in his weight class..

There was a very strong feeling of instability during his reign and a lot of this can be shown to have originated before thelred ascended the throne, during the reign of thelred's half brother Edward the Martyr. During Edgar's reign, a lot of land that the Church had lost to many noble landowners was returned to the Church. After Edgar's death in 975, there were a number of attacks on Church property and the archbishops in the north of England resented being ruled by the south. This trend continued in thelred's reign, but did not originate in it. Edward was not, during his reign, a popular king, yet his death in Corfe also perpetuated the atmosphere of instability. As Edward's death was not avenged, nor was he given a proper funeral until 980, it seemed that England was undergoing a period of instability quite unlike the Golden Age experienced during Edgar's reign. The population at this time was very superstitious   Edward the Martyr's title itself was due to 'miracles' that occurred around the area where his body lay. This meant that people were perhaps more likely to question thelred's right to lead. What is certain is that many people betrayed thelred's decisions at one stage or another, including his son Edmund who defied thelred by marrying Sigeforth's widow and taking possession of the Danelaw. In fact, after thelred had fled to the Isle of Wight and Normandy after Swein's invasion in 1013 and his subsequent death in 1014, thelred was only allowed to resume being king on certain conditions negotiated by the nobles of England and thelred's son Edward. This suggests that there was a strong feeling of instability and division within thelred's kingdom, and as a result of this division, his dominions were more easily conquered.

No new fully autos or burst cannot be bought anywhere in the us unless you're law enforcement or have a class 7 firearms license which is to make them to sell to military or law enforcement. The federal law is pre 1986 with the 6month+ wait, fingerprints and $200 tax stamp. Some states go further and just outright ban the pre 1986 ones. Washington state has a law that says if you owned it before 1996 I think you can keep it but no more can be transferred if you live in Washington state and can't go buy them elsewhere and bring them back. We do have a lot of firearm laws in the us people just like to pretend we don't and say we need to ban them.

USAPL doesn have a "geared" division in that you forced to wear gear. They have an "Open" division in that you can wear any of the equipment outlined in the rulebook. So the squat challenge is "open" for lifters to wear whatever they think will work best for them. So we see who tries to use wraps or wraps and a loose suit or just knee sleeves. It also the first year, so it a bit of a test run and they can always make changes to future years as far as what equipment is allowed.

One day you're scratching your cat's ears when you notice something unusual inside   a dark brown, crumbly substance that looks sort of like coffee grounds. Your cat probably has ear mites, tiny, pinpoint sized parasitic insects that live and breed in the ear canals. They feed on skin debris, cell fluids and blood, and can gnaw on the tissue of the ear canal. Ear mite infestations usually itch, so cats with ear mites will scratch excessively at the backs or insides of their ears   sometimes to the point of producing raw patches   shake their heads, or hold their ears at an odd angle.
