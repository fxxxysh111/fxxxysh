I bet we be playing as a human, but there will be a lot of aliens we can interact with in the game as NPCs and probably have as companions. This can be a lot of fun like it was for me in the ME trilogy, I rarely chose the human companions for Shepard once I had other options except for their personal missions. I really would like to be able to play as an alien in a Sci fi BGS RPG game though, even if I will still make human characters.

Righteous anger of the white masses is not at the bankers and politicians who put us in this mess, but at Mexican immigrants. If I could have predicted that a huge portion of angry white Americans would have their rage misdirected, perhaps I could have also known that the Obama administration would not be able to resist the lure of military "solutions" to political and economic problems.

Remember that the bet following/on the river (the 5th community card) is the most important. This one must be powerful and intimidating. When the opponent checks, and then it comes to you, you can place a large bet to get the opponent to call or fold. If a player bets in front of you, there are two things you can do. If s/he bets small, your making a significantly larger bet might push him/her to fold. However, if the opponent makes a large, bluff like bet, your best chance to bluff would be to call (less risk)   or go all in, especially if you have a lot more chips than the other player. Consider, it is better to push all in by betting than by calling, since you want to look strong to have more impact. The best feeling in poker is deciding someone is bluffing and taking down a large pot with a bluff of your own, causing the first bluffer to fold, and no one ever knows whether either or both of you were bluffing.

11 11 12 is a gloomy day for mankind, because it is a turning point to a next phase in human history. The gloominess does not only results in physical death, but also a spiritual death. Look at the spiritual death scale today; it is growing at a very high pace. People translate evil as goodness and darkness as a light. Jesus is beginning to overthrow the tables of money changers again. At this phase of human history, we will witness the fulfillment of woes mentioned in Isaiah chapter 5. Surely, my heart desires a peace on earth in GOD's will with perfection and purity among all people. Unfortunately, GOD knows the evil of man's heart will not repent and turn away from sins of their hands. We can witness that the lust and greed of the things of the world had never been woven as deep in human history as we see today. All are sold out to the idols of the greed of gold, wealth and worldly ambitions. People are worshipping their idols at the high places as never before. The judgments mentioned in Isaiah 5 are ready to come to pass. 11 11 12 is a beginning of a phase for an upheaval of nature, as well as a revival of the Church of Christ. Please read the tab ?Most Recent Prophecies?. It will help you understand the significance of this prophecy. Pharisees denied JESUS because HE did not come according to their expectation. GOD fulfills HIS prophecies not according to what we evaluate, but according to HIS ways. HIS ways are not our ways and HIS thoughts are not our thoughts. This prophecy came to pass.

Some would argue that the traits are more prevalent in different genders as the result of social constructs that shouldn exist and using terminology that refers to the gender stereotypes further reinforces these social constructs, preventing societal development and gender equality.

If 0.01% of people have the capacity to be amazing at maths but 5 times more males take maths then you end up with 5 times more male maths geniuses   this can perpetuate the mindset that "men are better at maths" and the shameful lack of women in STEM degrees doesn improve.

Texas Hold'em is usually played with nine or ten players at a full table with a rotating blind system. A blind system is designed to generate money to put into the pot and stimulate betting. There are two types of blinds, the big blind, which is equal to the minimum bet at the table you are playing at, and the small blind, which is half the amount of the big blind. For instance, if the table minimum is $10, then the big blind would be $10 and the small blind would be $5. The players who have to contribute these blinds rotates on position to the left after each hand. In tournament play, an additional forced bet, called an ante, is also sometimes used in addition to the rotating blind.

GROWTH"Gambling is now bigger than baseball, more powerful than a platoon of Schwarzeneggers, Spielbergs, Madonnas and Oprahs. More Americans went to casinos than to major league ballparks in 1993. After 1978, gamblingaccelerated at an incredible pace and it is a big business, withstaggering dollar amounts: on a typical day in the mid 1990s,consumers spent $627,213 every minute of every day on all types ofcommercial "gambling" in the USA and all of these commercial "gaming"ventures combined made a profit of $56,970 per minute! If you wish,you can legally gamble (or be "entertained") in 48 of the 50 statesand only Hawai'i and Utah have no legal gambling activities. You can:(a) go to 10 states that have either land based or riverboat casinos;(b) participate in state sanctioned lotteries in 36 states and theDistrict of Columbia (including multiple state lotteries); (c) go tonumerous local card rooms; (d) or go to 20 states that have some sortof Indian Nation gambling.

Mass philanthropy took off in a wide variety of fields. Community chests sprang up in every major city, and the Red Cross took volunteerism and grass roots philanthropy to new levels to support the troops abroad. By the 1930s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the March of Dimes, volunteers knew how to canvass entire populations in large and small cities alike. Today, it is possible for practically every citizen willing to spend a little money to respond directly and almost instantly to world emergencies simply by sitting down at a computer or picking up a cellphone.

By the way if he is indicted, it would go to the supreme court obviously, and even if the decision was made to indict Trump, it would be after the 2020 election anyway. I think that the thinking here behind why he isn being indicted yet at least until after the election. 
Having an elite RB is better than not having one, but what the Ravens can do as an offense isn going to be greatly impacted by the RB. Unless the RB is Rob Kelley or Paul Perkins level garbage, your team will be fine. Gus Edwards is your typical replacement level back. Dozens of RBs can do what he does. He fine. Give him a hole and he run through it. When the Ravens throw, they bring in a different RB. The team can run its offense this way. The improvement on offense going from Edwards/Dixon to a singular elite RB would not be as noticeable as you think.

Not necessarily. I have 2 moles that I really hate how they look and want removed. If I get them removed it is technically cosmetic surgery/plastic surgery. It a source of a slight amount of insecurity that surgery can easily fix. So why do you think I wouldn be happy afterward? Not everyone changes drastically with plastic surgery. The people who remain unhappy with their looks afterward tend to be those who become addicted to it, but they are far from the majority. Not very.

They a systemic insecticide, taken up by the plant as it germinates and grows! That means they get in every inch of the plant! And it hard for farmers to find seeds that aren treated, even if they wanted to. The rest flows off to contaminate the soil and groundwater and all the plants near the fields that weren even treated. Oh, and soybeans? Yeah, they use seed treatment too. And the best part is that it doesn even really increase the crop yield. They just do it anyway. Because ag companies.

So it takes approximately 150g of soy to get the same amount of protein (20g) as 80 90g of meat. The average person needs approximately 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight, which is estimated to be 46g per day for women and 56g per day for men on average, so for the sake of math we say each human needs, at minimum, 50g of protein/day. 50g of protein means that each person would be eating (if we are talking soy alone and ignoring amino acid deficiencies) 375g of soy per day to get their recommended protein intake..

Unlike essential oils, most non essential oils coat the hair, rather than being absorbed into it.

IP Ban is just unfair because not every ISP provide static IP, not every pc have different public IP. The IP get recycled if the previous user disconnected the modem.

As for recency bias in this context I think it just comes down a lot to people grading shows immediately after they finish, when whatever feelings they have are still really fresh, which is the only way I can guess as to how Code Geass R2 is rated as high as it is.

If you want to learn to program, IMO Python is a better starting point, you are just less likely to burn out and you can make real tangible things much more quickly.

Yes and no. The less experienced a female bodied person is sexually, the more likely it is that they will be more on the nervous/tense side when first becoming sexually active. This means the muscles in the vagina contract and tighten up (which is the main cause of painful sex for those that experience it when first becoming sexually active with internal stimulation).

When the horrific shooting in Vegas occurred last month, Hollywood rightly cancelled two movie premieres and edited at least one television show out of respect for the victims of the tragedy. But CBS' Young Sheldon (a prequel spinoff of The Big Bang Theory) felt it was okay to air an episode, immediately after the shooting at a small town Texas church, that depicted a small town Texas church service with main character Sheldon (Iain Armitage) stating that he wanted to "destroy" his pastor to prove God does not exist.

I mean you can argue that but at the end of the day kids are always going to be able to access content deemed inappropriate for the context of their time, whether it be playboy magazines or a glimse of a harlot ankle. I remember watching Happy Tree Friends in early primary school as the teacher did not grasp that the internet could be used to look up inappropriate non porn things. Although it is a tough job, parents are always going to explain ethics and raise kids to understand right or wrong in concepts they are not able to keep up with, though I do not envy those parents raising their kids in the birth of the internet age.

Sure, I'm on the same page with you. But are we to assume that the teeth pulling stopped with Natalie? Seems like a lot of folks on here think she's gonna pull Mae's teeth too, to finish the floor. (I haven't read the book yet, so maybe it's in there.) It'd make more sense if the teeth pulling was specific to Natalie only, since she was the biter, ya know? But if she pulls the teeth of 2 of her 3 victims, then it doesn't make sense to me. Maybe it's as simple as something like she hadn't gotten to that room in the dollhouse when she killed Ann, so she didn't think to pull teeth yet.

The rising cost of healthcare has even previously led some public figures, like philosopher Daniel Callahan[2]and Colorado Governor Lamm,[3] to advocate healthcare rationing against older patients. In the US, healthcare costs have risen from 5% of the GDP in 1960 to 17.4% in 2013.[4] Costs have grown because of the discovery of better diagnostic tools to prevent illnesses, the treatment of hitherto untreatable diseases, and the prevention of unexpected death by CPR. These technologies improved quality of life and increased life expectancy from 47.3 years in 1900 to 78.7 years in 2010.[5]They have benefited every age group, yet it is the "elderly" alone who have been made the targets of calls for healthcare rationing in order to curb these costs.

That a myth though that contracts have anything to do with paper or signing; that just something done because it provides proof in a court. A contract is just any agreement that is considered legally binding. A lot of contracts are what called implicit contracts where the law recognizes that common sense entails that you make an agreement without verbalizing it. Like ordering at a restaurant establishes an implicit contract that if you order something you will pay for it even though you never actually vocalized it.
I allow myself some time to dwell, because self pity is a bit cozy for short periods, and I believe there is learning to be had in the process of dwelling, but throughout that process I remind that life "is what it is", and that all there is to it. There are infinite choices in life, none of which allow us to see into the future beforehand. You can punish yourself even though it illogical to do so (even though we all do, sometimes), but then you can choose to face the fact that it not in our nature to make perfect decisions all the time.
