Heroin is metabolosed into morphine, so technically we are just using a more pure form. There is nothing inherently BAD or addictive with heroin that makes it better than any other opiate. At the end of the day its totally inactive until metabolised to morphine, and thats kind of the issue.

Thats why we are seeing more synthetic non prodrugs like tapentadol.

It is really weird. I wonder if their parents or grandparents had similar issues as a generation, or if this is really just a baby boomer thing.

Two pair will win, in Texas Holdem' hands ranking two pair is higher than three of a kind. The reverse is for all other types of poker. This is not even close to correct, whoever typed this is not smart or simply does not know poker rules. However, it also depends on whether the dealer qualified or not, and whether the player bet on the Pair Plus. On the Pair Plus it does not matter what the hand is, if it is a pair or better, it gets paid. If you are talking about other players on the table, it does not matter, in Three Card Poker the players play against the dealer and not each other. (Full Answer)

There are these drivers whose game is to wait until a green arrow, gun it going straight past all the people waiting to turn left (who are starting to roll forward now) and then cut in to the left turn lane at the last second, thereby avoiding having to wait though a few cycles of the stop light.

Even with complete knowledge of how everyone wants to vote, it is very hard to co ordinate such a campaign to shift votes in such a complicated way. But it should be difficult to tactically vote to get rid of someone you don't like against the wishes of a substantial minority of people.

How it effects individuals is that let say you have an idea to start a restaurant. Right now you have very little money. You work a job that pays $25/hrs. If you save up for the restaurant, it could be years before you have enough to open a restaurant. So you borrow. The bank lends you $500K. You built your restaurant and cut the ribbon. Now you owe $500K to the bank but assuming your choice to own a restaurant is a good idea and you have the necessary work ethic, you are now are generating substantially more revenue with a restaurant than at a $25/hr job so you can pay back your $500K loan much faster it take to save up $500K making $25/hr. Multiply that by every business owner and that what you call a consumer economy.

Villain is loose passive so you will be dominating a lot of hands like weak Qx or Jx that will call twice. I also think hands like sets 2 pairs and straights will raise turn a lot even if he is a passive player. I think you should bet this river here   I go something like $90 and fold if he jams. 
Point 3. I dont think the warming from Co2 is anywhere near what is being claimed. and natural variation will swamp whatever contribution Co2 does have.

This is all jolly good and to be encouraged. TEDx talks, however, represent something of the 'ber three minute thesis test' in the sense that not only must you tackle a big issue but you must also do so in a way that is sophisticated yet accessible, entertaining but serious and thought provoking but not ridiculous.

In 06 we got tickets to game 5. I was a freshman in HS and it was during finals of my first semester; a lot of my teachers weren't onboard with me missing finals for baseball but I had worked it out nevertheless. Game 4 gets rained out so I end up going to school on the date on our tickets because everything will be pushed back a day because of the rainout. Turns out some combo of MLB and the Cardinals org decided it makes more sense to inconvenience 45k people by 2 days than 90k people by one day; so people with game 5 tickets go on the day they were scheduled to what became game 4, and people with game 4 tickets go 2 days later than schedule to what became game 5, the clinching game. We find out the game is still on and I get pulled out of class in the middle of finals so we can drive the 4 hours to STL to make the game. Cards obviously win both and we got screwed out of seeing the clincher.

Kuba hatte im Drei Lnder Vergleich die beste Infrastrutkur und ffentliche Daseinsvorsorge. Insbesondere, wenn man es mit Kolumbien vergleicht. Die Ungleichheit ist deutlich Sprbar. Die schwarze Bevlkerung lebt deutlich prkerer, Indigenen geht es noch schlechter. Der Staat hlt sich scheinheilig mit Argumenten wie "Indigene Naturvlker inruhe lassen" raus und bietet keine medizinische Grundversorgung. In Kuba kommt es teilweise zu Stromabschaltungen, wenn es aufgrund der Blockade an Kohle mangelt. In Kolumbien leben meiner Meinung nach aber mehr Menschen ohne Infratrukturelle Anschlsse, weil der Staat lndliche Gebiete nicht erschliet und "die freie Marktwirtschaft, Angebot und Nachfrage das schon regeln".

In terms of proper poker strategy the sizing is donk as fuck. It way too big. Leaves behind a 1/4 or smaller bet OTT. Impossible to balance. Missing value when you have it, risking way too much when you don The best way to get money in the pot is bet the same amount relative to the size of the pot on each street. If he bets 75 into 180 and gets a caller he has 130 behind and there 330 in the pot, around 40pct each street. Betting 100 into 180 and picking up a caller = there 380 in the pot and he has 105 behind. Anyone who has a clue is gonna recognize that he have a tiny fraction of the pot behind when called and thus can never bluff turns, since he can be bluffing turns he can be bluffing flop either, as a flop bet would be sized such that if it doesn work there would be sufficient room to maneuver on the next street and decide whether or not to fire an additional barrel.

Stuff sacks. Just one. a small one for all your dinky stuff. Truly a gallon size ziplock with a few quart size and snack size bags inside it are all you need. Load your pack by putting in the liner first, then just stuffing in your sleeping bag, stuff whatever clothes on top of that, drop in your dinky stuff, then twist that liner bag up like a breadbag, squeezing the air out as you go. then put your food on top and cinch it all down. Keep it simple and easy.

Even professionals must play a style that is natural for them, but overall they are far more flexible in reacting to the environment than amateurs. All of which means there are no fixed rules for what percentage of hands "should" be won. At lower stakes, I would say that as a general rule the professionals are winning fewer but bigger pots than the amateur. Occasionally the table is so easy that a professional can overrun it and win the vast majority of pots because the opposition simply fold too much under pressure.

They were camouflage1 artists employed as magicians, Wartime Magi, employed/drafted to make ships and such disappear. Since it was (sort of) first noticed in 1915 that designs odd to the environment, stark geometric patterns and such, were capable of fooling the eye, people with design capacity were pressed into service, rendering offensive and defensive instruments of war optically semi impervious with variations of the then five year old modern nonrepresentational art. That must been a very odd position to wake up to every morning.
