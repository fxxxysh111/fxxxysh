So in poker, the "300 bucks" is basically having fun playing the game, being a good player, being rewarded, etc. The "stabbing in the arm" is just a bad beat. 
Another title which could be fun is one that makes it so when you perform a red maneuver you don receive stress, but after performing a red maneuver you roll one attack die, on a (hit) or (crit) result gain two stress tokens (I open to the idea of only hits activating the extra stress). This would give you the chance to gain a massive advantage, at the cost of possibly being in a worse spot. 
All in all though, that setup as you have it will sound great..

VATICAN CITY   Pope Francis on Friday cleared two of the 20th century's most influential popes to become saints, approving a miracle needed to canonize Pope John Paul II and waiving Vatican rules to honour Pope John XXIII. Both popes are also closely identified with the Second Vatican Council, the 1962 65 meetings that brought the Catholic Church into modern times, an indication that Francis clearly wants to make a statement about the council's role in shaping the church today..

Killdeer young are able to fly away soon after they are hatched, but there was no way to know whether they would hatch quickly.Killdeer are not considered a species at risk, although their domestic numbers in Canada have been on the decline over the last four decades.Still, moving the nest required federal approval, which arrived ahead of a deadline that would have caused a cascade of construction problems for the 11 day festival, which gets underway next week.Monika Melichar of Woodlands Wildlife Sanctuary in Minden, Ont., some 300 kilometres west of Ottawa, began the painstaking move by placing a replica nest with the eggs inside near the real one.The mother killdeer flew away at first, but returned a short time later, resting on the replica nest."These birds are good   the parents haven't given up yet," Melichar said.She will be moving the nest one metre every 20 minutes until it reaches its new home about 30 metres away from where the stage will be located.But if the mother abandons the eggs, which is a possibility, the eggs will be transported to a facility where they have the best chance of survival.The nest' new home is far enough away that the birds won't be disturbed by the hundreds of thousands of music fans who will trample through the festival grounds to see the likes of Shawn Mendes, Bryan Adams, Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band, among a host of other acts."There was a big learning curve, those of us involved with the festival had to quickly get up to speed on what needed to be done, so certainly it's not something we'd like to go through again," Monahan said.

Sure they may look the same or even taste the same, and the labels are likely to contain similar (if not identical) lists of key ingredients. Does this mean that they are all the same? Certainly not! In fact, numerous manufacturers state that their products meet or exceed all GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards, but do they really? It appears that the only objective way to determine the credibility of a manufacturer's GMP status is to see its certification. Why go through all that trouble? Because end products from questionable, non GMP certified manufacturing processes may lead to less safe and less effective supplements for your patients. Therefore, be sure to distinguish the products made by GMP certified manufacturers from the rest!National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA)Please note that obtaining GMP certification is very expensive which is why most nutritional supplement manufacturers are not officially GMP certified. But make no mistake no amount of funds can grant a GMP certification unless the company successfully meets the rigorous standards of all GMP requirements!Ingredient selection makes the biggest difference in the quality of final product. Bargain nutritional supplements are often made with low cost ingredients forms or types of nutrients that may not be most efficacious. So, how do you VERIFY the quality of ingredients? The required comprehensive scientific evaluation of ingredients is available only through sophisticated scientific analysis performed at a hi tech laboratory. Unfortunately, only few companies have invested the resources to implement such testing.

Because those are detected via different methods. Exoplanets are typically detected when they pass in front of their star (relatively speaking from our point of view). These infrequencies in light coming from the star can be used to discover them and gain some insights on their size and other characteristics. Planets on very long orbital trajectories in our solar system are significantly harder to detect. They can pass between us and the sun, they are too far away and don reflect enough light to find them visually. They are mostly detected by irregularities in other planets orbits. Basically when a planets orbit (like Neptune) has irregularities in it orbit that aren conform with our current model of our solar system. So like in this case we assume there must be a mass (undetected planet) that is causing this effect.

Is the Most Traveled Book (MTB) a category of book, or a single title, or a single copy of that title? Is it thousands of people moving the book, or is it just the single book making the trip? If it was just a title, then the number of miles packed on Stephen King books traveling back and forth to the beach or wherever by millions of people over several decades would probably outweigh the travel of all of Homer on a galactic scale. My preference is for the single copy scenario. Also: I like this to be a published book rather than not, simply because the boundaries get a bit too misty for me.. 
Bluffing is all about acting and betting inside a way which can be totally unrelated for the actual position of condition in the player. For instance, if a player has negative hand, but he nevertheless wager within a way as if she or he includes a good a single, then it means that he or she is bluffing.

By the way, if you literally wrote what you said then I would say you made a mistake with the years by leaving out . or o at the end. In Russian, a year is not a (cardinal) number but an ordinal number since years are read as if you said "in the 1948th year" or "in the 2012th year". If we pronounced years in English that way, then writing "He was born in the 1948th" would be wrong. I am pointing this out in case you did not realize the use of o (at least in speech).
You could also point them to Fortune's list of the "100 Best Companies to Work For." In 2013, the companies on this list saw revenues increase by an average of 22.2 percent   not too shabby [source: Biro]. 
To paraphrase the old saw about suckers at a poker table: If you can spot the sneaky gossip at the office, it probably you. But you probably shouldn be looking for him or her at all. That is, people who try to ferret out workplace enemies are likely to create some that didn exist before, at least in part because their own eavesdropping, snooping and gossiping sets colleagues to talking about them.

Shaja originated out of a simple idea; in a future with dozens, eventually hundreds of human settled worlds, what if somebody set out to reconstruct extinct ecosystems on one of them? Thus Shaja was born as an outline, little more than a summary really.

When pokemon cards started getting popular in my neighborhood I of course flipped, that was right up my alley. But dad stepped in pretty quick and said if he ever found out they were questionable they were gone. I was excited as hell that he was allowing them! I got a 3 prong folder and card sleeves and started collecting. I collected almost every single pokemon over the next few months, 149. I had just gotten a holo chancey card which I was ecstatic about, and I only needed a charizard to complete my collection of 150.
Your cousin was super insensitive. she didn give a shit about how you might feel, she just made it all about herself. You simply spoke the truth, and if she couldn handle it, that her problem. What they think doesn matter their universe is warped. You are not the ugly black sheep to ANYONE or in ANY universe. You are a beautiful, strong person, who has made a great life for yourself despite terrible adversity. I so sorry your mom made it traumatic for you, and you, my friend, are entitled to have WHATEVER FEELINGS YOU FUCKING WANT about the event, about your mom, and frankly, about ANYTHING. Forget the heinous anuses. You do you. WE admire you and send you all our good positive thoughts for the future. That isn what credit cards are for. They there for convenience, so you don have to carry cash, and you should only use them if you can pay them off immediately. Otherwise you on the hook for almost usurious rates of interest. People get into terrible debt this way and take years to pay off. The ONLY time you should use a credit card as "credit" is for an emergency, which is not "a guitar you really like" but something like a last minute flight to see a loved one before they pass, a sudden medical emergency, etc.
So, back to the what ifs; what if the reason Pacquiao defeated Hatton had nothing to do with drugs, but was because he had learned to use both left and right hooks, neither of which he used in his early years? And what if the only PED that Pacquiao has ever used is Mr. Freddie Roach, one of the best Performance Enhancing Dudes in the business?

In my experience, Fitbit is the king of lifestyle tracking. Meaning, your day to day activities like walking to work, sleeping, and your overall average heart rate are all tracked 24/7, and no other tracker does that as of yet.

Bell the cat To dare to confront danger at its source, despite overwhelming odds. The allusion is to a fable recounted in Langland Piers Plowman (1377). A group of mice continually harassed by a certain cat met to decide what to do about the problem. One old mouse suggested that a bell hung around the cat neck would serve to warn the mice of the feline approach. This idea was greeted with much enthusiasm until a bright young mouse brought up the question, who will bell the cat? to grips with To face up to a problematic situation and deal or cope with it; to tackle a problem head on in an attempt to get it under control; to grapple or struggle with a dilemma or difficulty. The idea of confronting an opposing force suggests that the expression may derive from a sport such as wrestling. This theory is highly conjectural, however, because the many meanings and uses of grip allow for a variety of possible explanations.

I say Spidey has a solid 8/10 here still. Deku has way more chances to get a good hit on Spidey since he can use his fingers but a single wind blast won knock Spidey out. Deku even managed to land several OFA (obviously not 100%) punches on Todoroki and he was still able to get back up. Deku has nothing that he can use to defend against being webbed up aside from continuously breaking his fingers for wind blasts. There nothing stopping Spidey from just abusing his webs until Deku can do anything.

InsuranceMassage therapy insurance should include comprehensive general, products liability, personal injury liability, medical expense, sexual abuse liability and damage to premises if leasing a building. You may also need worker's compensation insurance and commercial auto coverage.

Expect to pay between $200 to $300 annually for malpractice and general liability coverage.

We caught the train from Hung Hom to Guangzhou in China   the train system in Hong Kong is just amazing. So clean, and as a tourist, there's no chance of getting lost. We even got peanuts and water given to us complimentary on our train trip!!! We arrived in Guangzhou shortly after 3.00pm, and oh boy, were we in for a culture shock. There is such a mix of poor and well to do in the same areas, it's just incredible. China and Hong Kong don't have clothes lines   all their clothes are hung out the windows or on balconies, so everywhere you look there are buildings with hundreds of clothing items hanging on them. The smog in China is just awful, but it's something we'll have to get used to I guess.

Key point in article below:  consider chiropractic adjustments extremely important. One of the things an adjustment does   and it's the only form of treatment that can do this   is to activate the gamma and alpha motor neuron loop. A chiropractic manipulation will activate the alpha gamma motor loop, which will make the spindle more sensitive to stretching. This process will inevitably change the tonus state of the muscle.

The Oseberg ship has is a 15 "room" ship, meaning it has 15 pairs of oars, or "rooms" for 15 pairs of rowers (30 men in all). The Norse and early English ships seem to be divided that way into "rooms," from what we know from record keeping; Alfred the Great seems to have ordered several ships of 20 rooms and there were some that were larger.

This situation creates an enormous problem in addressing the diagnosis and treatment of headaches.

However I would be far more inclined to accept any further theoretical thinking that wasn necessarily based on empirical evidence from an Atheist scientist, than I would a modern Christian one. 
Starting OverIn science a theory is not the same as in common usage (ie, 'an unproved assumption'), but is an explanation of observable phenomena which has been tested and not found to be wrong, yet. Before a theory is accepted by the scientific community, the research should be duplicated by someone independent of the group or individual doing the original work. In the case of the 'Theory of Unsupported Falling', the independent group decides to try an experiment with a helium balloon and so proves the theory false. The hard work put into the original research is not in vain though. Those first observations and experiments, together with the experiment with the helium balloon can all be used as observations in a new round of using the scientific method. New cycles through the method could eventually produce the 'Theory of Unsupported Falling of Objects Heavier than Air on the Planet Earth', which would be confirmed by independent researchers.
Now these two syrups probably have somewhat different refractive indices, and the resulting mix is opaque for the same reasons the snow is white and opaque while ice is transparent: multiple refractions capture light until it is absorbed.

Remember that time when democrats paid millions of dollars to russians for "opposition research" that said the Russians have blackmail material on Trump and that Cohen was meeting Russians in Prague and then the FBI never bothered verify it and used it in a FISA warrant to spy on members of the Trump campaign (Carter Page). Then after Trump won the election the FBI started an investigation into Trump "colluding with Russia" based on the unverified information. So a newly elected president was being investigated the first half of his term while we found out the top FBI agents before the election were talking about making sure Trump doesn win, insurance policies in case Trump did win and the disgusting stench of people who shop at Wal Mart who probably support Trump. But then it turned out that Cohen has never been to Prague and it was all a hoax and then no one cared about that any more because we have to keep investigating a legitimately elected president because he got a potty mouth and he isn even very nice to the people that have been screwing up the country for so long. And because he a threat to our democracy for trying to preserve the constitution. that was awesome.

Easiest way to get the shoulders to release is to press directly into any and all sore spots on top of the shoulder at the base of the neck, and to then rotate and bend your neck and head to "work out the kinks".

On a different table this time, the dynamic was more verbal and somewhat more intimidating. However with an inappropriate amount of alcohol in my system, I was relatively unaffected by the fear of it all. In the first hand I was dealt, I made top two pair with KJ (or something of the likes) in a multiway limped pot for a double up + change. I was happy with that, I wanted to leave. I remember asking if I was allowed to. In retrospect I understand how horrible of a move that is, but I was a naive beginner, I just wanted to know my rights. After being too late to escape before the next hand was dealt, I picked up AT, and the pot was limped again going to the flop, 3 4 way. I remember flopping a gut shot to broadway and sticking around after some flop betting from my opponents. After banging it off on the turn, I shoved over an opponents bet, who called it off with top and bottom pair, and the river bricked. I remember looking up at the rail and my mate being in absolute awe of what I had just pulled off. Feeling like fucking Zeus, I walked out of the poker room, 500 up in profit.

Social theorist Pierre Bourdieu would have described calling anti choice activists pro life as a form of "symbolic violence." For Bourdieu, the symbolic order of things is a way of keeping the status quo in place. Economy and culture rely on symbolic violence as a way of getting us to either ignore social inequality or to accept it as natural. The term "pro life" in supposedly objective journalism is a form of violence that marks those opposed to abortion rights as "ethical" and those in support of abortion rights as unethical sorts, selfish and self interested people who just want "choice" as if it the same as deciding between flavors of ice cream..

Age is the first factor in determining if something is vintage, and it's also the hardest to pin down. Most will say something qualifies as vintage if it's 20 to 25 years old or older. In fact, the online shop Etsy, which allows users to sell vintage and handmade goods, requires items labeled vintage to be at least 20 years old.

If you are a communicant that means that you are confessing that you believe in the doctrines of the body you belong to. If, for example, I somehow came around to changing my mind on the ordination of women, I simply could not continue communing in the Church of Canada, let alone remain in the Anglican Communion at all, because the issue goes to the foundations of doctrine and principles and the very legitimacy of the Communion, not simply about whether or not, by accident or design, I happened to only be at services with male clergy.The whole thing is ecclesiastical nonsense.

The cellular portion of blood contains red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets. The RBCs carry oxygen from the lungs; the WBCs help to fight infection; and platelets are parts of cells that the body uses for clotting. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. As children, most of our bones produce blood. As we age this gradually diminishes to just the bones of the spine (vertebrae), breastbone (sternum), ribs, pelvis and small parts of the upper arm and leg. Bone marrow that actively produces blood cells is called red marrow, and bone marrow that no longer produces blood cells is called yellow marrow. The process by which the body produces blood is called hematopoiesis. All blood cells (RBCs, WBCs and platelets) come from the same type of cell, called the pluripotential hematopoietic stem cell.

If you don acknowledge that, any claim of trans acceptance you have boils down to I think they faking it and they mentally ill, but I don want to be an open bigot or doublethink.

Showing kindness to kids does not mean we secretly giving in to some mystical maternal force that proves deep down all women really want kids.
