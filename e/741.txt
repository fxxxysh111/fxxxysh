The Athanasian Creed is usually divided into two sections: lines 1 28 addressing the doctrine of the Trinity, and lines 29 44 addressing the doctrine of Christology. Thus, each person of the Trinity is described as uncreated (increatus), limitless (Immensus), eternal (ternus), and omnipotent (omnipotens). While ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the Trinity, thus avoiding subordinationism, the first half of the Athanasian Creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one Godhead, thus avoiding a theology of tritheism. Furthermore, although one God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from each other. For the Father is neither made nor begotten; the Son is not made but is begotten from the Father; the Holy Spirit is neither made nor begotten but proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque).

Well, I have never heard of a KA234 straight. However, Poker is kind of vague. What type of poker are you talking about?Poker is always changing. More games are coming to the table. Heck, if you play short deck trips beats a straight. However, I'm assuming you are talking about holdem.In standard holdem, AKQJ10 is called broadway and A2345 is called a wheel. There is no such thing as wrapping around with KA234.Let me explain things you might be interested in about straights.It's possible for the board to be the nuts. If the board shows AKQJ10 and no flush possibilities, you might as well ship the house, the farm, your bank account, and go into debt. You can't lose. This is a rare situation. Even a straight flush on the board can lose. Example, if the bard is KQJ109 all hearts, you have a king high straight flush. But your opponent could hold the royal. I'd rather have the nut straight that can't lose if my other option was the king high straight flush that can lose.

In your data analysis, I see you describe two statistical pitfalls. First, you state that you exclude data points from your analysis not because they are measurement errors, but because they don fit your vision of what the model should look like. It almost a self fulfilling prophecy, in the sense that you are exaggerating the difference between your comparison groups to prove that the two groups are different. The second pitfall is that you performed 4 independent analysis on the same data set to describe the variance, without including them in a single model as covariates (such as an appropriate regression model). If you were controlling the false positive rate of these analysis at 5%, that means the true false positive rate will be 1 (1 0.05)4 or about 18.5%.

It doesn matter if its 50%+1 or 50%+48%, you need 50%+1 to pass legislation without a tiebreaker.Thus it is very easy to validate the claim whether or not only democrats have had a majority in both houses of the California State Legislature and if OP wanted to put a thought into knowing if person ensure then OP could have done so. 
What a great running title this is: "The Earth a vast bombshell"! It appears in a section on earthquakes and volcanoes in a popular series by Dionysius Lardner The Museum of Science and Art (vols III IV). Lardner reaches this conclusion after reasoning that if the increase in temperature of the earth increases as it seems to that at the dept of 40 miles the Earth would have a temperature of 40000, increasing 1 degree fir every fifty feet of depth, "or 1000 per mile". And so at these temperatures it must be so that most of the interior of the Earth would be "liquid fire" which "must extend to the very centre of the globe.".

My first PT had me doing mostly VMO exercises (straight leg lifts, etc.), which I did for nearly three months with ZERO improvement.

I very pro vaccine, but I also against mandatory vaccinations. I have all my shots (and even some of the optional ones they don push that hard, like meningitis). My kids have all their shots. But I also don think mandates are a good solution. As much as a parent who doesn vaccinate their child angers me, and as bad as I feel for the kid, I honestly don think most of these people are bad parents or that the foster care system is going to result in a better outcome for that kid. Once you through the demographic shift, the median age should be roughly half the age when people die. So if people die around 80, the median age should be 40. If they die around 90, it 45.

Though the successor Turkish Government helped to institute trials of a few of those responsible for the massacres at which they were found guilty, the present official Turkish contention is that genocide did not take place although there were many casualties and dispersals in the fighting, and that all the evidence to the contrary is forged. What that German Ambassador is obviously a personal note that does not justify or prove that the government is indeed intent to kill all armenians. 
The odds of being dealt suited connectors in poker is 2 in 51. Here's why: No matter what card is dealt first, there are two cards that will make suited connectors with it. For example, if the first card is 5d, then the second card must be 4d or 6d. 
For someone who has grown up in the modern world, the city of Rome, even after its redevelopment by Augustus, was not a particularly pleasant place. I actually posit that the gladiatorial contests would be one of the most recognizable   and even accepted   things in modern society. There were rules, there was a referee, and, while certainly a blood sport, a gladiatorial contest was more about fighters coming out on top, rather than the loser actually dying (which was reasonably rare   current estimates are that 80 90% of losers in any of these contests went on to fight again). The arenas were large, with some reserved seating, awnings to protect the audience from the sun, raucous fans, and vendors selling overpriced food. Yeah that part isn terrifically civilized.

I had the good fortune to be tableside, reporting, when Phil Ivey won the 2005 Monte Carlo Millions. By general consensus, a hand he played in that final, versus England's Paul "ActionJack" Jackson, might just be the most amazing hand of Poker ever played, when both players were bluffing, and Phil   with nothing but queen high   forced Paul Jackson to fold after 5 betting. To be fair, Paul only had 6 high, but Ivey could not possibly know that. It was breath taking stuff, especially given the context that they were playing for a million dollar first prize. We all went to dinner afterwards, and Ivey, who generously paid for the dinner, (admittedly he had just won a million dollars) insisted he absolutely knew for certain, 100%, that Paul had been bluffing. I've never seen a hand of Poker like it, before or since, and I still have no idea how he pulled the trigger in that spot.

And of course we remember Bill Clinton who was notorious for lying through his teeth and cheating through his pants exactly at the time he was taking consequential decisions on global matters.

I am a new immigrant to Canada from the USA. It a lot like starting from scratch. And it also the new year. So many things I want to accomplish but the biggest one for me, aside from learning to speak French, is writing every dang day. I feel as if I be able to do the other stuff that I want to do/get done like working out more (ie walking the dog more), or finishing up work projects, once I nail the writing thing. One page a day. I have a degree in fiction. I haven done much with it. My chops are rusty. I have ideas of stories that come to me all the time. I write down ideas in my go to notebook. But I haven been good at all with just starting a flow, which means starting with just one page. And then seeing what happens from there.

You are trying to argue that Venezuela is socialist and obviously try to imply that it failed because of socialism. Which isn the case.

I recommend this for several reasons. 1) If you have a working dog like a red heeler, they like to look to you for work. So it's part of the job for them. 2) Eventually this exercise gets you to a place where if the dog is unsure of what to do, they look to you for direction. This is great and you want this because it can help redirect unwanted behavior by having the dog ask you to redirect them. 3) This is a foster dog and you want to set them up for success. Basic obedience stuff is 90% focusing on the handler. Eye contact is the easiest way to teach this. 4) With a dog who is looking to you a lot, you can teach them so. Much. Other. Stuff. I mean like you can zoom through 101 Dog Tricks book. Why do you want this? Cuz this dog is a working dog and new tricks for 10 minutes a day will tire them out in a way that a 30 minute walk just won't. 5) Bonus, if you teach them lots of new tricks, even if they don't remember them with their new owner, what you've done is taught the dog that learning from their handler is excellent fun and rewards tasty treats. You've fostered a dog who now enjoys learning, and that's always huge behaviorally.

Still, a dying mother's accusing finger is enough to raise a few eyebrows. The cops started circling around McCullough, but quickly found that they couldn't break his alibi, which had been backed by his family and, oh yeah, had held up for more than five goddamned decades. Yet the police persisted and reinterviewed a bunch of people connected with the suspect. One routine interview with a former girlfriend led to her giving the investigators an old photograph from their time together.
Here we are going to talk about the theory behind the "push fold" strategy used in the middle game or "bubble" stage of a sit and go, which can be defined as the following:  There are four or five players remaining (in a ten man SNG)  The average stack size is 15 big blinds or lessUnlike the early stages, on the "bubble" of a sit and go you need to open up your game.

Always seek more information. Cunning people perceive things that others miss. They see life's hidden machinery   the real motives that drive interactions, rather than the stated motives. The first, most important step to seeing things as they actually are is to always get as much information as possible before making your decisions. This can be as simple as taking the time to look around before dropping an anonymous love note into someone's locker so that you don't get spotted or as complex and involved as doing hours of research on the person you're about to interview so that you can surprise him with particularly biting questions. When approaching all major decisions, keep your eyes peeled and have a voracious thirst for more information. You can never be too well informed.

Be it that is was inefficient setup to have one person in the cooking area and 5 7 at the front counter doing ice cream and orders but it worked to an extent unless we got hammered with food orders.

Granted it was the dead of summer and like 104 degrees, you would think everyone would be getting cold treats and whatnots. Noooo, everyone was ordering burgers, fries, corndogs, chilidogs, etc, etc. After seeing my screen max out at 10 pages worth of food orders and my worthless trash of manager refusing to help the cook area, I snuck out of the cook area, grabbed my clothes, changed out in the bathroom and left through the back door then booked it on foot to my house making sure everyone at drive through saw that I was escaping.

Instead of releasing the information to the public and letting the country know that we were electing an adulterer.By no means is she obligated to tell this story to the public but she is no white knight either. In fact if they wouldn have paid up we could potentially not be in this situation and have a different president.PunkToTheFuture  19 points  submitted 14 days agoAll the Trump supporters in my family parrot ridiculous and easily provable lies constantly. 
Tell her that if you have to file suit, win or lose, you are done with her. 
For example, the next cards played after a seven will either be the six or the eight in that suit.. 
I unemployed and everything in my savings consists of gifts and a teacher salary. 
For 15 years she earned her place in poker community preferring to play in tournaments with small buy ins. From time to time, Lucy takes part in the WSOP; 6 times she left the tournament with prizes and twice fought for the first place at the final table. 
Exactly! You shouldn't be badgered into it from these signs and no doubt they will ask if you're planning on tipping too! They will give sideways glances if you don't ask for singles right away to tip. 
The streets, walls, roofs, facades retained their former appearance, while the interior of the houses acquired modern hotel amenities. Today it is an attractive combination of an ancient exterior and a sumptuous interior, intended for the upscale tourist trade. 
We started asking influential thought leaders across industries if they would be willing to speak about their work in the context of trust and AI, which was the theme of the summit. We did not require them to promote Affectiva at all. We did keynote presentations and panel discussions. We did not pay anyone a single dime, apart from the few nonprofit organizations. An event like that really helps you foster the relationships when creating a new category, and it leads to collaboration and innovation.
But I don know if they are, so I would need to assess that. 
However, in 2006 the WSOP decided that all tips would be pooled so it is not possible to tip individual dealers anymore. Further to this it may be that younger players, or those with primarily online experience, just don't tip as much all together. 
So at the end of the day, it is what it is. I'll just go out there and play hockey and try to help the Maple Leafs.". 
I voted for hope and change twice, and well, we didn't get much of either.
With the gambling industry in India estimated to be over $60 billion despite the ban, Nepal, touted to be the next casino capital of the world, has aggressively started targeting the growing Indian middle class to its shores.

I find most/many of the people are pretty inspiring on the show (it is often the enabling family I find most bothersome as some are feeders and manipulators). There are a few major train wrecks that I enjoy "hate watching" but overall in all the seasons I have seen (which is most of them) there are more you really root for then not. It is especially inspiring when the young people get their life together as in your 20s you have so much life left if you can tackle morbid obesity.

Nevertheless, players sitting down with a actual money poker dinner table have realized that they could be endangering too much of their poker potato chips on account of a number of unusual circumstances above their management.

The dealer will go around the players until each one decides to stand. He then plays his own hand, which determines the outcome of the game. Obviously, each hand is different. Generally, players using copy the dealer hit on 16 or less. This is a bad strategy. The never bust strategy is a little better, but it is still a bad strategy.[1]
It as if people are forgetting that Kim Jong Un is not only starving his own people, but threatening to murder millions in nearby countries. Oh, but Trump said someone was pretty. That so much worse.

The last serious poker playing I did was two summers ago, in Vegas. I did one of the World Series events for Omaha Hold I didn win, but I didn do too badly. Then I won a bunch of money in some side games, so it was good. I kind of OD on poker for two months and since then, I just been too busy to do it.
In the real world, it was frequently oppressive and corrupt (especially at upper levels of society), but that didn keep the hoi polloi from believing it fervently and honestly.. 
In different era's there obviously are different violinists who can be considered as the most famous in the world. It's like with music in general that one might like the virtuosity of one performer over the other. 
The biggest plus for me is this: using Linux is very liberating. Minimal stuff is turned on by default, configuring becomes a case of editing system files, nothing is corporate or obfuscated away, you only turn on what you want. There is no Candy Crush installed by default. The app store doesn ask for a credit card. Systems like iCloud and Airplay don try and entice you further into a corporate rabbit hole.

It is not difficult to know what going on in their mind. Contrastingly, the new birds are making their own techniques and reforming the old ones side by side. Thus their moves cannot be guessed because of their new reactions to different moves.
I don't need to google it. I know the risks from peer reviewed studies and have heard the complaints of patients who have experienced adverse effects in person. 
I am most looking forward to the interactions between the other scholars in the Scholars Academy. We are all in the same boat as we have been selected out of many applicants to be in this academy. I'm excited to get to know all of them and work together to have business start ups as well as business opportunities. 
At this point I stand up and can believe I just threw away all my profit plus buy in. For the sake of the story, $300 was around a week paycheck for me, college student working at a grocery store. This was not life changing but definitely lifestyle changing money. I was sitting in the 10 seat and stood up to collect my things when I see the dealer, in what I remember as super slow motion, reveal the Ace of spades on the river. I was floored. Biggest pot I ever won coupled with the fact it was a stone cold suck out. Guy in seat seven adds he folded an ace, so an actual one outter. Ironically, the guy I beat was the only reason I was in the club, a friend of a friend who got me the invite to the private club.
Also, I listed the Oakenfist as Corlys bastard, not Laenor as it is highly suggested in Fire Blood that Laenor was gay and Corlys was the real sire. Whereas I did not list Daeron II as Aemon Dragonknight bastard, as this is potentially only a rumour Aegon IV used to embarrass his son.

If it wasn't for this particular man being a family member, and therefore attending family events, he'd be a lot easier to avoid. It makes me feel a little better to know it isn't common that people are like this though, and that others don't think his behaviour is normal, since it's made me more introverted to avoid those situations. 
Taraji P. This is most often apparent in its half hearted invocations of the inimitable Cardi B (key word: inimitable), as well as its attempts at conceptualizing a black female lead with a self winking (and too self congratulatory) awareness of our current cultural climate.

While Ashley was showering she noticed a man reaching through the bathroom window with a mirror!!! They had two meals in Delhi and saw mice in the restaurants. They took a train to Jodhpur and then illegally hopped on a 3rd class connecting train to Jaisalmer.

This isn't really accurate, and I think it's a result of conflating and confusing Marx for Lenin, Stalin or Mao and them with each other. This was mainly due to Communist and anti Communist propaganda, since Communists wanted to say they're inheriting the legacy of their God Emperor Karl Marx (seeing how they talk about him would've disgusted Marx since he hated hero worship) and Anti Communists wanted everything about the ideology discredited. But the differences in ideology are stark..

I don't know enough about the sport or the conditions of the animal, but if the bull lives a long healthy life and is well taken care of for doing a performance a month, it might not be a bad deal. Obviously it would be better if they were free in the wild, but that's not going to happen.

I honestly wouldn have been surprised if she was 18, so imagine my surprise when she told me she was 28! I looked her up later on the Dream Heaven website and that lists her as 23, but she must be telling the truth because a woman wouldn lie about being older! Anyway, I give her a more generous score for 28 because she looked and felt so much younger.

Wanna know why the freedom riders weren lynched or physically cast away? Because they had a group of armed men behind them that watched over the situation. Rosa parks even talked bout how pivotal Robert Douglass was, the man who wrote Negroes with Guns and the man who influenced Malcolm X.

After that my midgame and endgame has still to do a lot and there the main difference is that I have more experience / know more patterns and have a better evaluation for the patterns. Many of the standard things they know as well, so often they make as good moves as I do and sometimes they beat me because the game just happens to have those patterns that they know and are able to evaluate correctly.

As gambling markets mature and players become more experienced, the demand for video poker has tended to become stronger. 
The owners of many tracks   along with ghost tracks that now offer only simulcast racing   are hoping to survive long enough for states to let them drop the facade of dog racing altogether and just run casinos.Lawmakers, mindful of the interests of deep pocketed casino operators who don't want the unfettered competition, seem to have other ideas.Last year, West Virginia lawmakers rejected a bill pushed by one of the state's two dog tracks to cut its licensing fees by more than half and to reduce the minimum number of race days.Two months ago, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad signed a bill that will shutter one of the state's two tracks by 2016.Florida, which in 1931 was the first state to legalize wagering on greyhound racing, opted against a measure in its most recent legislative session that would have allowed tracks to keep poker and slots and ditch the racing. The plan, which proponents hope to revive in the session next year, is seen as an expansion of gambling and faces opposition from gambling opponents and other competitors.The "decoupling" movement has created an odd alliance between racetrack casino operators, who see the races as a burden, and animal rights groups out to end greyhound racing altogether, much as they succeeded in outlawing cockfighting several years ago.

Streets were filled with crowds and red flags and banners. Some holiday was being celebrated. Only then did Powers realize the date on which he had dropped uninvited into the Soviet Union.

In quality control, it is very common to sample without replacement as bad parts are discarded. If we consider drawing one card, putting it back in the deck, regardless if it is a spade or not, then reshuffling the deck and drawing the second card, the probability is 0.25 x 0.25 = 0.0625, a bit higher with replacement.

Finding the most suitable round poker table for your needs may prove to be quite challenging. First, you will want to focus on the interior area of the room that the table will be placed in. While you are focusing on a round table, you must also understand that there are many different sizes and designs available today. Long gone are the days of being able to choose a poker table that is one general size and one general design.
