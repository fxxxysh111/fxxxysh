I like to see what reasons people give for saying the SSA385 is good value at $500. So far, I only seen subjective arguments like "style" or "the Seiko brand heritage". I mean, you free to think the Seiko brand deserves a price premium, but it seems to me that runs contrary to what Seiko has always stood for and is praised for (offering good value at lower prices) and amounts to having your cake and eating it too..

My father was my mom fourth husband. So when they got divorced when I was five she knew what she was doing pretty well, since it was his first marriage. I was young, and my dad still cared about me back then, so it didn seem like a huge deal, but she put a deal in the divorce that as long as I was a college student, I would continue to get the child support my mom used to get after I turned 18. It would last until I turned 22 as long as I was a student. Me and my dad grew apart, he got a new family, by the time I was 18, and only going to community college he tried so hard to back out of that deal. But it was great. I was 18, getting $550 a month.

Late in Day 2, with the blinds at 6,000/12,000, I folded hands more than a few times on the button.

Last time you politely declined the date and he didn take it well but have you actually talked about it since? Frame the conversation around your kids as opposed to around his misplaced feelings. Express that you really enjoy family time and see how much it means to the kids. They really benefit from seeing mom and dad being courteous and friendly to each other despite the change and you love for this to continue moving forward. Tell him you appreciate how he working with you to make things go as well as possible for the kids during a difficult transition for them. Be clear that you are grateful with how the two of you have been moving forward and you want to keep things going in that direction. You respect him as a co parent (and friend?) however, reconciliation is off the table. Maybe ask him what he thinks and if he happy to keeping having family time or if that should be reduced (or paused) temporarily.
Regular veterinary visits. When you take your dog in each year for his veterinary exam, the vet doesn't just give him some vaccinations and send him on his way. He does a thorough exam: palpating the body to make sure all the internal organs feel normal and there are no worrisome lumps or bumps; checking the condition of the eyes and ears; listening to the heart and lungs; checking the weight; and taking the temperature. Because dogs age differently than people, this annual physical is comparable to you having a physical exam every five or six years. This is especially important if your dog is middle aged or older because it gives the veterinarian a chance to find and treat health problems before they become serious.

Ultimately this movie is about the power of love. The Taj Mahal is one widower's monument to his wife, and is referenced in the movie in cute ways. The Taj Mahal is beautiful for sure. And yet Manjhi, an uneducated man of the lowest caste, gave his best years to move a mountain, which gave his whole village opportunity for generations to come, all in the name of love. I think that's even more beautiful. The love of this movie is not just romantic, not just those joyful moments between two people. The love here is simple, yet great; it is a love beyond relationships, a vow to take care of all people. For thousands and thousands of days, Manjhi's broken heart reverberated in every swing of his hammer, until one day it was no longer a broken heart, but a broken mountain.

VATICAN CITY   Pope Francis on Friday cleared two of the 20th century's most influential popes to become saints, approving a miracle needed to canonize Pope John Paul II and waiving Vatican rules to honour Pope John XXIII. Both popes are also closely identified with the Second Vatican Council, the 1962 65 meetings that brought the Catholic Church into modern times, an indication that Francis clearly wants to make a statement about the council's role in shaping the church today.

My chihuahua/rat terrier mix is very mouthy. She was less so with me because I was very consistent, but it can still be an issue with my kids. The thing that was worked best has been totally ignoring her when she starts with the nippy behavior. I would put my hands under my butt or behind my back and not give her any attention. The moment she stopped trying to nip I would go back to playing with her. If she started again   repeat. I told the kids to "be a tree"   so they stand totally still (again with hands behind their backs) and wait for her to calm down. That has made loads of difference. Also make sure your pup gets enough exercise. I found when she is cooped up indoors it gets worse. We reward her for barking if someone is at the door so she can alert us if anyone was trying to break in. When she is really riled up I have found getting her attention on me and having her sit makes a big difference. I have heard to start by rewarding the barking so then it becomes something you can do on command, but there are much more knowledgeable people here to help with that side of things.

She'd read my journals to try and find out if I was having sex. I wasn't having sex with anyone. When I ended up with a terrible guy because I was trying to escape her, her main concern was whether I was having sex and that I was "a slut".

Will you allow re buys?Playing No Limit Texas Hold 'em means that it's possible for players to lose all their chips very quickly. Allowing players to purchase more chips if they lose them all during a specific amount of time is one way to make sure that everybody gets a chance to play for an ample amount of time prior to being relegated to watching the tournament from the sidelines. The other benefit to re buys is the additional money in the prize pool for the winners. Set the number of rounds for which you will allow re buys.

The policies they instituted work for them, and didn't hurt anybody they knew, mostly, so they thought it was good. I don't believe much of any of them thought, "fuck the future," but rather, "yay! The future! They'll have it just as good, or better, than us! This growth/consumption isn't unsustainable at all!" Now they're so deep in it, they can't see these issues due to conscious or unconscious blinders that make it hard for them to admit they fucked it up for us.

Romeo age is never mentioned, but 16 17 is a reasonable guess (any older, and he surely would be married). Shakespeare audiences would have recognized the absurdity of two children of wealthy families getting married by their own decision for love.

They lectured the world on political inclusivity. They hectored nations on democratic plurality. They wagged fingers at others for following dreadful leaders. They invaded alien countries, spent trillions, displaced millions and killed hundreds of thousands in the name of teaching others their way of life. They uprooted perfectly functional constitutional orders and imposed (actually wrote with their hands) new constitutions for the un willing, or those they vanquished. They termed every sign of resistance to their imposition as insurgency.

Dealer Position   This position, also referred to as "on the button", is the most coveted because once the flop takes place, the dealer is the last to act. This means you can watch and gather information on all the other players before making your decision. Aggressive play is expected from this position, especially when all others have checked. Almost any hand except trash hands like 9 2, 10 4 offsuit can be considered for play here.

Now that I got my Who Needs Sleep nuttiness out, let's try to focus on some of your concerns. The first point I'm going to address is one that is a recent Reddit issue not just for our users, but for our mods as well. In the course of modding not just in the JustNo network, but elsewhere on Reddit as well as speaking to mods from a decent sampling of subs, ModMail has been very slow as of late, at times even briefly inaccessible. Obviously that causes frustration for both our Users and Mods alike! Contrary to what some may believe, we enjoy hearing from you no matter the issue be it good or bad. We request that you use Modmail as not only do all Moderators get to view the message no matter what time of day you send it, nor what time of day any particular mod happens to be on. Quite unfortunately for both you guys, and us alike, during those times the old saying of "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!" The other bit to that is that it is our policy is that when you contact us about a removal, or to reach out to us about a concern that you may have with a specific moderator, the mod who handled your issue doesn't handle the modmail. There are the certain times when the same mod may reply, but that is generally to ascertain your need, and to let you know that we've seen your message and have highlighted it for the other moderators.

Durability: Exercise balls can vary widely and most companies will put the weight limit of the ball on the package. Weight limits can range from 250 to over 1000 pounds. If you are using the ball just for bodyweight exercises and are under 250 pounds, just about any ball should suffice. Higher durability exercise balls are recommended for people lifting heavy weights on the ball. Lower durability balls are generally thinner and create more of a challenge in terms of balance.

I wonder if this is a generational shift. In the 90s/00s, it seemed like a pretty big deal that white people shouldn ever sing along with the n word in music.

People who want Overwatch to be grimdark, edgy or more mature just smack me of the insecurity people who enjoy cartoons in adulthood possess.

The Fried Rice. I like to start the rice in between the first and second fry of the chicken.

So many schools in the country are all boys or all girls. And I noticed that in one of my co ed schools (I taught in a bunch of middle schools in the country), the boys and girls were still seated separately in the classes   the boys on one side and the girls on the other. I also noticed that I rarely rarely seemed to see boys and girls hanging out in groups as just friends, they seemed to only go out together if it was a couple thing. And when that happened, the girls had this obvious role of dressing up to the max and looking beautiful, and I swear most of the time I witnessed couples together, they were focused on taking selfies together and not really talking much. It seemed like it was really hard to form a real friendship bond along with a romantic one (this is from an outsiders observation, at least. I not Korean, so this is my "foreigner view.")

He lit me up haaaard, leaving me in the dust, all the way up the biggest hill in the race of course. At this point I think I resigned the fact that I was racing for second. By the time I got to the top I couldn't even see him! I pushed as best as I could down and into the finish. 2nd place! I'll take it. Turns out Cody was only 3 minutes in front of me, but he put that distance on me in the last couple of kilometers. Crazy!

Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941)DirectorVictor Fleming StudioMetro Goldwyn Mayer PlotDr Jekyll believes everyone has good and evil sides. He is in love with his fiance Beatrix 'Bea' Emery. When her father Sir Charles takes her away after refusing to allow their early marriage, he plunges himself into his work. He creates a formula aiming to excise his immoral side. This instead transforms him into his evil counterpart who keeps a barmaid named Ivy as an imprisoned mistress, physically and (it is implied) sexually abusing her, until he learns that Beatrix is returning to London. Once again as Jekyll, and filled with remorse, he destroys his work and sends money to Ivy, hoping to make amends for Hyde's behaviour. When MGM made this Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde adaptation they purchased the earlier film's screenplay and destroyed all available copies of this version from the then bankrupt Paramount to prevent unfavourable comparisons. They made some minor tweaks to character names and also toned down the earlier film to make it more in line with the Hays Code, making Ivy a more respectable barmaid, although the theme of Hyde personifying Jekyll's lust and sex drive was retained.

So the "solution" they offering is for the half marathon and 5 mile to run the same course, but the 5 mile start an hour and a half later to give the half marathoners time to complete (half due to start at 7AM; there will be slower runners still on the course at that time, including myself).

What I interested in is what their definition of a bump stock is. The Constitution supposedly protects us from discrimination but it quite specific as to what kind of discrimination. There are many forms of discrimination that the Constitution doesn protect us from. Is it possible for them to swing it by saying that any stock that literally bumps into you when firing is considered a bump stock?? It says "any device with similar characteristics." How similar are we talking here??? It quiet vague and I don like it. Leaves room for loopholes and that BS

Even though poker requires total dedication to it, it is possible to let the family understand that you are busy at a particular time. You can then join them after the breaks and enjoy the much demanded time

Given your budget it be hard so you might want to look for a used gun. A Marin lever action .30/30 could probably be found if you look hard enough and will give you the best bang for your buck. Also any bolt action .308 made by Ruger, Savage, Tikka, Mossberg, or Remington will do the trick.

I also suggest saving a little bit more money so that you can spend around $500 on a rifle. That amount should get you a pretty good package to get started.

By allowing the testimony of suspect actors who could still be puppets of the President, they risk their entire case. Stick to the facts that can be discovered by known good people and information.

Then the only common denominator here is your dating, flirting, and relationship skills. Just like learning to fly an airplane, you need to learn how to do it. No woman will date you because it obvious you done nothing to improve your relationship skills.

Jay Heaps dealt well with Vancouver's substitutions  Vancouver coach Carl Robinson had plenty of weapons on the bench to throw at the Revolution. Bringing on Pedro Morales added some creativity and skill that was absent from Vancouver's play in the first half. Adding Kekuta Manneh mid way through the second half gave Andrew Farrell and the Revolution defense a speedster to deal with on the left flank. The back line held up and Heaps was able to keep his squad focused. It was obvious that everyone on the back line was fit and ready for the athletic and dynamic play of Vancouver's depth.
