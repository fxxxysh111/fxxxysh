I never understand that. Why does he seem to be addressing the viewer as Vsauce? Like some YouTubers will start a video with "Hi YouTube!" and that makes sense to me. In that case it the platform they addressing, not just a channel, so it is inclusive of non subscribers. Like if I had a "Feanturi" channel, I wouldn be starting videos with "Hi Feanturi!" because that would just be weird. But is that really what it is, he talking to his channel even though many who wind up linked there may not actually be "members"?

I 45 and still don have it all figured out. I have re invenvted myself many times. For what worth, I didn get "serious" about work and life decisions probably until around 28. Finding a career isn easy, especially in this job market. Don beat yourself up about it. You have to spend time figuring out what you like and hate, what skills do you have to offer, your temperament, in order to decide what kind of job is best for you as well   or figure out if you need some further training/school. Plus, a lot of people who seem "together" right now   could be burned out or jobless the next time you see them. Life has a lot of fluctuation. If you footloose and fancy free, that perfect time for risk taking and adventure. It a great time to pick up and move to a new city. Sometimes that jumpstarts your life and gets you out of a slump. At any rate   enjoy the downtime. The next thing you know, you yearning for the days of being able to sleep in or stay out all night.

So it made sense when the entire political spectrum in the National Assembly got on its feet to condemn Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri for their "blackmailing." Tehmina Daultana was at her shrieking best to "let Imran Khan know that a few thousand agitators can't dictate the Parliament which represents 180 million Pakistanis." She had a point when she asked who would bring about the so called revolution   Chaudhary Shujaat, Sheikh Rasheed, Shah Mahmood Qureshi or Jahangir Tareen. Aftab Sherpao smelled a larger conspiracy in the joint strategy of Imran and Tahirul Qadri.

The mockumentary has gained some popularity over the last decade, thanks to the success of TV shows like "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and "The Office." However, they're still in relatively short supply, which is a shame, because at their best, they can make for an extremely distinct and hilarious brand of comedy. "The Grand" is the latest mockumentary to hit theaters, and not only is it at times very funny, but it does something that most mockumentaries don't: It gives us a real sense of humanity.

During the summer I made friends with a more senior physicist named Francis Low. He had just been made a professor at MIT and was spending the summer in Los Alamos with his family. Francis also was not working on weapons, so I was surprised when, in the middle of August, he announced that he was going to Mercury, Nev., to see some tests.
You can be perfect with this easy recipe.

More recently, he became involved in various court cases after winning huge sums   up to 10 million   from two casinos, one in London, and another in Atlantic City. He had been playing as the front man for a syndicate, and the coup involved something called "edge sorting", which, essentially, took advantage of a weakness or flaw in the design of the playing cards. Whether you'd call that cheating is debatable, but one of the courts   the London one   ruled against our hero, and the other remains unresolved.

I honestly belive that while we can win a lot when the opponent is stabbing turn 88 just isnt the spot to do it as draws still have a ton of equity and none of the draws have actually gotten there. 89s KQs KJs are all better bluffing combos that can be in our 3b calling range and have a ton more equity. Now what are our value combos that could play a hand like this? ATs TT 77 maybe 44? And that right there is giving us a good bluff to value ratio for a X/R line on the turn..

In the bathtub, but not on a phone. You can set your tv up in the sink. I highly recommend leaving the hot water running in a very tiny stream, and wedging a toothbrush handle under the stopper so the tub drains slowly. That way, your water never gets cold so long as you move around from time to time. If you sit still, the water at your feet will get too hot and slowly cook you, but it better than shocking yourself when you inevitably fall asleep and drop your phone. 1 point  submitted 3 days ago

The reasons we do this are complicated. Partly it is because we are a culture born of a middle class revolution about 100 years ago when the upper classes (and lower classes) were denied power by virtue of middle class discipline. The middle classes, it was claimed, have more work discipline, marital discipline, bodily discipline, and sexual discipline. Therefore the middle classes are more fit to rule (this is probably why 80% of Americans identify as middle class  who wants to be undisciplined?).

In New York, we have that a pistol grip "protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon." We looked at other traditional hunting rifles with monte carlo stocks, and noticed that the grip part protrudes a consistent 1.5" 2" beneath the trigger. So we set ours at 1.75". That all that New York has given us, as far as "how to comply with the SAFE act." Everything else is pure speculation, in my humble opinion.

That verrrrry spewy.Is it because I am in first position that a lead out is bad on the flop?? Say if im in last position and everybody checks then would a lead out be bad.

My father travels a lot. He always has, since before I was even born. He home maybe half the time, perhaps closer to two thirds, but it fuzzy.

At mile 10, I was beat but I knew I needed to pick up my pace. I started to push and began to pass people who were ahead of me. At mile 11, I felt like I had no gas left in the tank but I tried to pick up my pace still, reminding myself I was almost done. My anxiety came back and I felt like there was no way I could do this   I just wanted to give up. My stomach hurt a ton and I regretted those gels. But I thought how absolutely wildly pissed I'd be if I missed my goal just because of these last crucial miles, so I just staggered on. Mile 12, there were folks waiting on the side to cheer and tell us "just keep going!" So appreciated.

That means that even if it wouldn effect the aesthetics of the building or neighborhood at all (it could even be designed to fake looking like a single family home from the exterior), developers aren allowed to build smaller units that would be more affordable. Explain why the government should be in the business of preventing private property owners from building whatever they want on their own property, especially when it presents zero changes to the aesthetic landscape of the neighborhood? Why would you support such anti capitalist and anti liberty policies? I will tell you why they have implemented these policies historically: to prevent poorer people who wouldn be able to afford the whole 3,200 sq ft home from living in their neighborhoods, which is literally the definition of discrimination..

Yeah, it probably theoretically a fine line to end up here with 4c5c, but it sucks to play. When UTG is a competent player and takes a line like that, you looking at a nutted range. You lead into the previous rounds aggressor who is still left to act, so UTG calling your lead with an overpair would be suicide. That pretty much leaves them with A9s, 97s, T8s, some 33 (if they open these pre), 99, some 66, and 77. 77 would be especially gut wrenching, but could make sense with a bet flop, check turn line. But 99 also makes a ton of sense with that line. What did they end up having?

A high stakes plan to keep Snowden safe was set in motion that began when he was escorted from the hotel to the UN building where Tibbo was waiting.

Recent years, numerous medical studies have confirmed the essential role of manipulation and motion in the maintenance of disc health, joint lubrication (synovial fluid), and articular cartilage nutrition. Increasingly, researchers have concluded: that impaired joint mobility, which alters the joint lubrication mechanism, may be the principal mechanism in spinal degeneration. The joints of the body are avascular (no blood supply) which leaves them dependent on movement.

This reminds me of the time my college roommate and I were hitchhiking. We got picked up by a van of people about our same age. We were pretty happy about the ride until they started in with, "Have either of you been saved?" Even though we were glad to have the ride, we told them they could drop us off at the next exit. They said, "Oh, I thought you were going all the way up North." We just said we had changed our mind. Then they were like, "Oh, well we be glad to take you where you need to go." We started to worry we were going to be kidnapped into a cult, and were relieved when they let us out.

But does having more "guttural" sounds (say, sounds articulated in the throat, such as pharyngeals and glottals) make a language objectively harsh? I doubt it.
