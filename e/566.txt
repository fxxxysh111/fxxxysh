This question is a little bit tricky. In a deck of 52 cards, one fourth or 13 cards are spades. So, the chance of drawing one spade = 13/52 or 0.25. If a second card drawn, there's one less spade in the deck, so the probability on the second draw is 12/51. In quality control, it is very common to sample without replacement as bad parts are discarded. If we consider drawing one card, putting it back in the deck, regardless if it is a spade or not, then reshuffling the deck and drawing the second card, the probability is 0.25 x 0.25 = 0.0625, a bit higher with replacement. This is the same as 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/8 or saying the odds are 1:8. I've included a couple of links on sampling with replacement and without replacement. Generally, for calculating statistics, we attempt to get independent results. The draw of one card, will reduce the population, and change the probabilities on the second draw, so sampling without replacement is not independent sampling. See related links. (Full Answer)

Preflop and flop play are fine, turn is kind of awkward with stack sizes (14 pot with 21 left), but I think a bet is still fine here as he has JJ a lot of the time here.

Exactly! He hasn't had to move forward in his past four fights nor has he had to deal with an opponent that posed both a significant risk on the feet and on the ground for those four fights. He's fought people perfectly dealt with via lateral movement and moving backward hoping to time a counter right. You could see he had that same hope that he could time a counter right the whole fight and couldn't adjust to Kamaru never giving him that opportunity.

I found this fantastic photograph of the attendees of the meeting of the Astronomische Gesellschaft at Hamburg, August 1913 in the December issue 1913 issue of Popular Astronomy. This is an august group, and of course they not "blank" or "missing" its just a function of some out of context observations on the opaque overlay that serves to identify all of the folks in the massive group photo. (I encountered these numerous times over the years and always have found the Found Art aspect of them interesting and amusing.) The fact of the matter, though, is that there were some very high powered people at this meeting. Offhand I identify Mader, Eddington, Abbott, Mueller, Plassman, Struve, Plaskett, Campbell, Repsold(s), Jansen, Schwarzchild, Backlund, Seeliger, and numerous others. This is probably a general truth, though it is particularly so with journals that cut a broad path in the communication of ideas, and this is certainly the story with the late 17th century journal/magazine, Bibliotheque Universelle. It ran from 1672 to 1726, and the intellectually thirsty editors ran a kind of review/abstract service for their readers they found (mostly) newly published books in a wide variety of areas, and wrote summaries and statements on them, with background history, and the occasional editorial comment. Some of the articles were on significant works by John Locke and Antoine van Leeuwenhoek, but many and probably most were on obscure topics in nitty theological history and mostly invisible philosophical issues, or at at least that is how the latter seems to me today. The Bibliotheque brought new ideas to the continent, and brought them in the Lingua Franca, which also happened to be French.

A risky tactic, bluffing in poker is not something to apply regularly. But for that extraordinary chance to take down a big pot at poker night, you might just be able to bluff your way through, to get everyone to fold by how you bet, not by saying much. 
But something happened with my friend's boyfriend. He came to realize that in the long run, his crappy little penny ante poker game was not safe at all. He saw that indeed he never lost much, but he never won much, either. 
We gave them a quote anyway, but they had already specifically requested a labor only quote for just a rework of the existing hardware, so I complied. Not too long ago I wouldn have even considered taking a job like that. Now I work in a completely different industry. For ten years I had to abide by strict industry standards and federal regulations. Now, I laughed at when I suggest spending a little extra money for safety, stability, or quality. I will say this though, I don miss the stress or the liability. That for damn sure.

Where I wouldn say that cheap, and I not eating super fancy, you can easily spend that by going out to eat for a single meal for one person.I think if I dropped a weight class I still be needing to eat 3000 4000 calories a day, which wouldn be too much different in price. Maybe save $3 4 a day as I essentially cut out a meal, so $100 a month? I feel like that amount of money could probably be saved elsewhere, but it all depends on priorities.

It's happening again. Last night, you whipped your workload into shape after spending several extra hours at the office. You finished everything you had pending for the next day ahead of time to make room in your schedule for two hours at that massage place you heard about. You've done this before; there's an infinite amount of work to be done and a finite amount of time to do it. Shifting one day's work backward feels like a huge effort, but that massage   and the happiness it would bring you   seems worth the attempt.

Finally, I read the last line as possible sarcasm? Like, "Oh, OK, everything is great for you and you have no problems. That just awesome. Goody for you." It hard to tell, but maybe one last poke at your gray rock to see if you will give it up? Or using sarcasm as an outlet for her anger that she couldn provoke you? Regardless, I think you are doing great! Gray rocking, relentless positivity, acting confused/literal, and refusing to allow myself to be provoked into an angry response have worked very well for me with my waif mom, and I think it a good combination.

In this game, it is the same as No limit Holdem, only, you can only check or fold post flop, and both players post 1 big blind pre flop, and can only check their option preflop.

Obviously, talk to your doctor and don do anything that hurts, but exercising shouldn put you into a flair. Purely anecdotal, but when I am hurting exercising makes me feel better 90% of the time. It never makes me feel worse but if I feeling extra crappy I just end it early and go home. Strength training is excellent, especially for us with our increased risks for bone loss, joint damage, and muscle wasting. I been powerlifting for over a year now and it is THE best thing I have ever done for my health. I can say enough how thankful I feel to have found it, especially because it seems that most medical advice has traditionally been to avoid it. Of course, finally finding a good doctor and getting on a medication that actually worked (Humira) has been life changing as well. And it took a long time of learning proper form and lifting lighter weights to get where I at now. I highly recommend strength training though. It is incredibly empowering. I also never been great at any sports, so it cool to be able to compete. There are a ton of good resources out there to learn about proper form, programing, and competing if you ever want to do that. My favorites on youtube are Alan Thrall and Calgary Barbell. There not a ton on the medical side, but Barbell Medicine is pretty awesome and has a podcast on rheumatology and training. Good luck with everything!

Not really just my character, but my paladin and my friends cleric have a combo called "Divine Deadlock", which involves the paladin casting Compelled Duel on an enemy and then the Cleric casting sanctuary on the Paladin, while Paladin takes the dodge action (flavored as planting the shield hard between him and his opponent). The fantasy was of having the enemy mind go kaboom from being torn between attacking nobody but the paladin and yet attacking everybody sans paladin. Even though mechanically the monster still can attempt to attack anybody, I like that combo a lot and it was my very first spell combo I came up with in DnD..

In a casino, this would earn them under $4 an hour, which minus dealer tips would probably barely break even. In an online poker room, the same player with the same win rate could play four tables at once, which at 60 hands per hour each would result in an earning of $24/hour, which is a modest salary for somebody playing online poker.

Unfortunately, there may need to be a time that you have to trade off for a short period: weight loss or fitness. What important to remember here, though, is that long term, the weight loss is helping your fitness goals, not taking away from them. I found it helpful to use the phrase "I on a cut", as that often has more fitness connotations and helped me not feel discouraged with my decreased physical abilities on a deficit.

The technique is not only simple and intuitive; it has sparked a revolution in computer game play of some of the most difficult bluffing games, including clear domination of annual computer poker competitions.Since the algorithm is relatively recent, there are few curricular materials available to introduce regret based algorithms to the next generation of researchers and practitioners in this area. These materials represent a modest first step towards making recent innovations more accessible to advanced Computer Science undergraduates, graduate students, interested researchers, and ambitious practitioners.In Section 2, we introduce the concept of player regret, describe the regret matching algorithm, present a rock paper scissors worked example in the literate programming style, and suggest related exercises.

Where does this figure come from? Assuming you play your hand out to the end, it will consist of seven cards. After the flop you have seen five cards or 5/7 of the final hand, which is equal to 71 percent. 
It is foolhardy to disregard the player's competence based on how they look, or appear to be acting. In business, many of the toughest lessons have been learned by misunderestimating the competition. That's why experience is important in games of poker.

It was amazing. I mostly car camped by folding down the backseats and setting up makeshift curtains with a sleeping bag and maaany many blankets (I did the trip during fall and early winter so temperatures really plummeted). Being alone was actually really great? You through a lot of podcasts and music during the drive and honestly if you just keep on the move you never feel lonely, the sense of adventure keep you stimulated. I decided to do the trip by myself because didn want to depend on another person wanting to stick to my exact itinerary or calendar (the entire trip took a few months) and plus I the kind of person who always more concerned on what others are thinking and/or feeling so it was freeing to be able to just concentrate on myself instead of worrying if the person riding shotgun was actually enjoying themselves. I did this after living in a large city for 10+ years so it was very needed escapism and proved to myself I didn actually forget how to drive (this was my first time behind the wheel in about 14 years   definitely trial by fire).

Everybody likes different things and finds happiness in different things and that goes for travel too   it took me a long while to realise that just because I'm travelling in a different way to others it doesn't necessarily mean I'm doing it "wrong" and that being overseas doesn't mean I should stop doing the same things I did when I was back home. That meant occasionally doing things like spending the whole day in bed watching Netflix or going to a cafe or park and just reading a book all day without feeling guilty about not "doing" anything.

The game is a turn based strategy based off of their original game, Runescape (which is great itself). The reason why this game is so good is it has a very appealing range of combat strategy and most of the time players start on a level ground. The best part is that the strategy can get intense very quickly and planning your next moves becomes extremely exciting, turn after turn! If you go try it out, make sure to complete the tutorial before heading into the multiplayer lobby, it's really worth the learning experience and prevents headaches early on in versus play.

Languages which do the thing where 3rd person pronouns are either demonstrative or quite transparently related to/derived from demonstratives, as well as languages which use common nouns in 3rd person meanings (which is attested, for example in some Chimbu languages (TNG; PNG), such as Golin and Salt Yui) are on occasion called "two person languages" as they distinguish only two "true" persons in their pronominal system.

Once I wrapped my head around the initially baffling rules of some of the card games, I enjoyed Seduce Me in the same way I enjoy being distracted by the occasional game of solitaire. Except here, the reward for winning is a few panels of illustrated erotica, rather than just watching some cards bounce around the screen. It ups the stakes considerably, and I found myself genuinely pumped whenever I succeeded in a game (fittingly, the goal in most of the mini games is not to beat your would be paramour score, but to get as close to it as possible) and disappointed when I failed..

Some men desire and expect virginity. Even if they are willing to enter a monogomous, life long relationship with a woman, the less sex partners she has had, the better. But let say she only had previous sex with just ONE guy. Sounds ok to most, but what if that one guy had a nine, ten, eleven or even a twelve inch massive dong (like so many black guys do)? After being thoroughly stretched and filled by such a mandingo manhood  do you really think she going to be impressed by your little six inch weener? I don think so. Note: link NSFW.

Bluffing is all about acting and betting inside a way which can be totally unrelated for the actual position of condition in the player.

Es ist ja in Familien, bzw. gerade auch ber mehrere Generation blich, dass man nicht mehr den gleichen Erfahrungshorizont hat: Deine Groeltern/Eltern wissen nichts vom Game of Thrones, du weit nichts von Kaiser Franz. Jetzt knnte man entweder sagen "was beschftigt dich eigentlich gerade zur Zeit?", oder aber man hat eine sinnloses und oberflchliches Gesprch ber "damals"; oder man fixiert sich eben auf die Kinder (dazu kann jeder etwas sagen), oder auf die Krankheiten (auch da kann jeder Mitreden). Was du da mitbekommst, ist meines Erachtens einfach nur Symptom dessen, dass deine Familie sich nichts zu sagen hat; oder vielleicht auch einfach in ihrem alltglichen Leben so wenig Gemeinsamkeiten hat, dass man eben ber Oberflchliches redet. Auch nicht unblich ist, dass man ja, wenn man sich so lange kennt, auch eigentlich noch echt hartnckige Konflikte miteinander hat (Groeltern Eltern), warum das dann fr alle am einfachsten ist, ber Bullshit zu reden. Und tja, Groeltern werden erstens mit dem Alter auch geistig nicht fitter, aber wahrscheinlich wollen sie dir nur zeigen, dass sie sich um dich kmmern wollen, aber sonst nicht wissen, wie. Jeder mag Kse, wie kann man kein Kse mgen? Ein satter Bub ist ein glcklicher Bub. und so weiter. Sie haben wahrscheinlich einfach nicht das Wissen darber, was du so machst, um ein echtes Gesprch mit dir anzufangen. "ey, SendMeOrangeLetters, alter kackn00b, spielst du Overwatch?

On a serene Tuesday evening, as the sun begins to set and the clouds reflect an ethereal glow from city lights, crowds congregate at the Vincennes racetrack just outside Paris. Proud horse owners, the bourgeoisie families gather on the indoor balconies of the hippodrome for dinner as they follow the races with binoculars. Parisian locals, mostly aging lower to middle income laborers and salary men, congregate on the outdoor stands and pore over the plethora of statistics available for each race.

No detail is too trivial to be factored into a bettor secret recipe for selecting the winning horse.

These are what my wife would refer to as "Beckies". Quick story; last fall, my wife and I were at a local MGM casino. There's a big mural of a lion in one spot, and people are lined up waiting to take selfies or have their photos taken in front of the lion. A group like this gets their turn and proceeds to take selfie after selfie for over a minute, changing their poses, making cringey fake smile after fake smile. Eventually, after 30 seconds or so, it becomes awkward, so my wife says "Move it along, Beckies!" I don't think the issue is that people are posing for a photograph, it's that it exemplifies the self absorption of the current times.

7. Force your competitor to react to your pricing. Smart players know they don't have to participate in a competitive pricing death spiral. Every player enjoys one or more value advantages.

For perspective, the homeless shelter sort of sits between the expensive (bougie) town center area (luxury apartments, retail, restaurants, office building, corporate headquarters, etc) and the suburbs (garden style apartments, single family homes, town homes, schools, grocery stores and froyo shops, etc). The area is developing rapidly, new apartments and condos are being built, new businesses come in all the time, so the homeless haven affected anything business  or property wise. Moms push around strollers, teenagers wander, elderly men and women go for walks, men jog at 6am.

Thomson managed to put an understandable assessment on a very difficult visualization, talking in terms of an atom being "1/10,000,000 or from 1/10,000,000 to 1/100,000,000 of a centimetre in diameter", or 1x10 7meters, which is just about the size of a cell nucleus or DNA; that in the neighborhood, especially if you look at the smaller number which is 10 8 meters, which starts to close in on the size of the massive carbon atom (10 10), but sorta not so close to the electron (10 12) , or carbon atom nucleus (10 14) or proton (10 15).

When we look at AI, I would say there are three important aspects we have to think about. One is that there have been breathtaking applications. Recently, one of the Carnegie Mellon poker AI programs beat the four best poker players in the world.

The idea that immigrant groups slowly climbed their way up the economic ladder over generations is largely false; the immigrants that were poor overwhelmingly ended up going back to their native countries.

Well that how I said, it may be a good model for you but not for them. I not talking about morals (that kinda silly in economics). Plainly pointing out it will be a net loss on average for the playerbase, as what you won is what they lost, and Valve took a cut out of your gains. So in the end, this model is more profitable to Valve than to the (average) customer. That the difference with the MTG paper market, where no one is taking a cut out of your transactions.

I track my calories to make sure I eating appropriately. No food is off limits, but what I eat needs to fit into my daily calorie budget. One thing that helps keep on track with this is to have a rule that all food/drink must be logged before eating. This way, I can see how that food is going to impact my day before I eat it. Often the simple act of logging is enough to deter overeating. For example, if I go in a enter in 10 Oreos, I will see that that would comprise 700 calories of my daily calorie budget and that enough to keep me from eating that many.

A prebuilt should have thermal paste pre applied, so you should be fine on that front, and prebuilts usually come with at least 2 case fans (not the best quality though, I replace those because they can get loud). If you plan on buying an aftermarket cooler for the build (because most prebuilts use Intel crappy cooler), a good cpu cooler will come with thermal paste (cooling gel?) that you can use (ie Noctua, Cryorig coolers) so you shouldn worry too much about thermal paste. If you buy the prebuilt, you should be able to customize it (unless parts are soldered in   but I don think that happens much [?])

You made one mistake earlier, not knowing a "rock" had the goods, when you tried to buy a pot with a check raise on the turn, on the come, to a draw that of course, never came. You consider your busted play, and then justify it as an investment for another hand. The rest of your losses all came while seeing cheap flops in late position, except that once, when the small blind raised you, and then it came back around. You knew you had to call just for pot odds sake. The flops have not been hitting you yet.

I also have swollen penis story, not as bad as that. First off had sex with the now ex wife. Must of been going at harder than normal cause after cleaning ourselves up, my dick is starting to look larger than normal (was still hard). I start feeling impressed with myself. The ex wife even notices saying why is it getting so big? Like bigger than a big bratwurst. But as I getting soft it starts staying bigger in only the shaft part near the tip. It starts getting scary, we go to the hospital. While waiting I go to the bathroom to check it out again, it worse looking but doesn hurt. After getting examined by the Dr, he says it nothing serious even though it looks like it is. Happens alot apparently. So I very relieved and start cracking jokes and get the Dr rolling. Made a comment about my dick basically having a lions main going on. The Dr is in tears laughing. The swelling goes away and I back to normal sizes.

How has Estonia avoided Moldovan style corruption? Some believe it made better choices early on, privatising state enterprises in a more transparent fashion. Tarmo Juristo of Praxis, a think tank, credits Scandinavian banks with establishing norms in the financial industry. But others think it may have got lucky. Lucan Way and Adam Casey, of the University of Toronto, argue that former Soviet states democratised better when they had a deep rooted nationalist movement. This was stronger in Estonia, which was independent from 1918 to 1940, than in Moldova, which was ruled by Romania or Russia for centuries. To judge by EKRE, though, that nationalism may not be entirely benign.
I don't know if I'd send an announcement (that might add to the confusion and it's strange to formally announce who you aren't inviting).
