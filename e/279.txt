Now, I do want to be extremely clear that I am talking about ethical power dynamics and absolutely did not state that this situation "is equivalent to raping a child" or anything like that. Most universities actually have strict conduct policies about instructors having sex with their students. While it's true adults are less vulnerable than children (I'm aware 18 is adulthood, thanks!), that doesn't make anything done to them completely acceptable. I don't want anyone to think that if a professor or boss comes to them and says "hey, your grade is slipping/your job is in danger, but you can make it up to me" through sex that a) that's in anyway acceptable for someone with power over them to do and b) that they have no options to get that abuse of power to stop. They do.

La rue Lon et plus encore la rue Myrha sont des artres centrales dans la vie du cur de la Goutte d'Or.

I wouldn't be surprised if this was totally true. Just like the few times Ive seen some people having seizures, or even our boston terrier who is epileptic, the few I've seen they've gotten very angry look like they are trying to fight off everything around them, almost like all of the sudden they're in a room full of strangers that appeared out of nowhere.

The comment was not another straw. That the point.

CPO is great because you get a warranty, but you pay a hefty premium. Honestly, you can get used VW from another brand dealer (not a buy here cry here.), and get an extended bumper to bumper warranty for cheaper than a CPO, even with the cost of the warranty added.

NTA   I can't speak for everyone in the military, but I know that myself and my coworkers (all active duty) hate when civilians try to cop that. They don't have to get up and run 3 miles every day, they didn't sign their lives away for 4 or 6 years (they can quit any time), they know when they get to go home, they usually don't deploy (usually contractors), and they don't wear the uniform. It's a hard life, but it is one we chose. With that, some places are generous enough to remind us that they remember our sacrifices, and give us that discount. It's small, but it's meaningful to us. Someone who hasn't done the above doesn't deserve to abuse their kindness like that.

I did not make the assumption that all natives were better teachers and never said so. My stance had nothing to do with the words that you put in my mouth and everything to do with what I actually said, which was that non natives shouldn be hired to teach English. This stance is based on the inability to filter out the bad ones and nothing to do with all native speakers being better teachers. Again, something I never said, but you keep trying to poison the well.

From time to time he was looking at me, but I was feeling completely insecure that I wouldn't be his type of girl. Even though all my friends were cheering me up to look at him and do something, I was really nervous.

I tried to give a good QCI rundown in terms of network, but I realized that doing a really good job might run afoul of NDAs. Basically, QCI 1 is "voice" in example terms. It much more complicated in network operation. The lowest access class ratings would be reserved for network operation, and higher order government function (POTUS, etc). Voice is very high priority, probably on par (or slightly above) ultra high priority business traffic. FirstNet is above that, including FirstNet voice.

One of the most unsettling moments I had wasn even in the dark. I was at a bus stop alone on the outskirts of a city and two big guys came up together and started waiting either side of me.

Don't be tricked into thinking that all five cards are the same color. The high card determines the winner if two or more people have a flush. .

She's unbelievably toxic and dangerous. She is also the absolutely WORST kind of addict: the kind who is in active addiction, though in heavy denial (but they're prescriiiibed!!), and feels compelled to spread her addiction around to other people by pushing highly addictive substances in them. I'm a recovering opiate addict myself, although I am not a professional counselor or an expert of any kind. I just have my one narrow experience and those that I've learned about while in NA. I've witnessed other addicts "sharing" their addiction often getting younger siblings or vulnerable SOs addicted, and when they share in NA meetings, they talk about wanting to spread their guilt around, as if that will somehow lessen or mitigate it. Or that if a "good, innocent" person joins them in their addiction, then they can't be that bad. It's the kind of messed up reasoning that only an addict can come up with. It's also a horrible crime against someone.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsTV GuideDigital Print EditionRUGBY league great Nathan Hindmarsh played 330 first grade matches but it was a much bigger figure   $300,000   which made his off field story compelling listening yesterday. The former Parramatta captain lost more than that through gambling over eight years. It was curiosity that first encouraged Hindmarsh to put coins into a poker machine when he was 18 and at the start of his rugby league career. And when he saw those coins multiply when they fell into the tray, he was hooked. "If I hadn't won the first time would I have had an issue with it? I don't know," he said. "But I did win the first time and lost and lost after that." At 26, Hindmarsh defeated his addiction before it dragged him to rock bottom. "I didn't lose houses, cars, friendships or relationships," he said. "You can get help before it gets to that point." Hindmarsh, who spoke to 150 people at Albury TAFE as an ambassador for Clubs NSW for Responsible Gambling Awareness Week, encouraged people to speak up if they were concerned about their gambling habits. "If you have a problem you will have that gut feeling," he said. "Once people understood I had a situation and wasn't just pissing money up the wall, it became easier. "If you have that feeling of disappointment, resentfulness and disgust then you have an issue." Hindmarsh is not trying to stop people gambling   he just wants them to learn to do it responsibly. "It's about education," he said. "You always talk about drugs and alcohol and I want to add gambling to that list.

Girl get yourself some fish oils!! I was having so many problems with my hair; it was breaking off, looking dry and frizzy, and would NOT grow past my collar bone for a solid 6 years. Then I started taking 3 6 9 fish oils with every meal and keeping up with my biotin (remember not to take it longer than 3 weeks as it can really mess with your B12 levels if taken for too long) and my multivitamins. Then i kept up with just general good hair practices: never sleep with it in a bun or pony tail (french braid if you absolutely have to) and don wash it too much, which i was SO bad for.

For example, yesterday I was supposed to do 11 miles, 4 at easy pace and 7 at 15K pace (which is 6:35 for me), but my 7 miles ended up being anywhere between 15K pace and marathon pace (which is 6:50). Granted, I was running inside, and it was tough to gauge what my actual pace was, since my watch tracks pace based on movement indoors (I feel like I was definitely running faster than 6:50 most of the time)

Wednesday was likely the best fishing day of the next several days. The coldest temperatures of the season will begin moving in today. This along with the wind will create frigid wind chills.

Then we get to the part where they do ask her to take the IS portfolio, which she says no thanks to for the obvious reason, and points out that moving her at all looks extremely bad, so they move her anyways, to Veterans Affairs, because. not moving her would set a precedent? Two cabinet ministers warned Trudeau not to do this, and he did it anyways, just to show them who the boss? Jeez, that is the thinnest reasoning possible. It shows pretty plainly that the reason for the shuffle at this stage was not filling IS with a heavy hitter, it was moving JWR out of MJ/AG. Butts doesn come off as honest to me here. The reasoning he gives doesn sound like something that makes good sense in the moment, it sounds like a post hoc concoction to cover his own ass.

That true! I actually somewhat lied. I do go out to eat maybe 4 6 times a year at a local restaurant because the whole point is no tipping. The owner starts servers at $15 $18 an hour (in a pretty low cost of living area   for context most manual labor/factory type jobs here start at about $11) and I know a couple people who have worked there for several years and are making $22+. The food is a bit pricier than a chain restaurant like Applebee or something, but they also source a lot of their ingredients locally so I don mind paying a bit more at all, and I happy to support a small business owner who takes care of his employees like that.

Jukai is a ceremony in which a formal student officially takes up the 16 bodhisattva vows. For us, we spent at least a week reading, studying, and sitting with each vow; then in dokusan we would share with the teacher the way we would articulate the vow in our own words. In jukai, each vow is read, then the student reads the vow in their own words. So using the first vow as an example, taking refuge in the buddha, my own words were: I vow to choose the path of the buddha and deliberately walk it, seeking wakefulness in myself and others.
