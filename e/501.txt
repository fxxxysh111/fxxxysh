It is also worth noting here that where I work we only work 5 days a week and within each sprint a day is lost to meetings like the demo, iteration planning meeting, retrospective and review so there is only 9 days to a sprint.

Keep in mind that you should raise more vs. small bets than you should vs. big bets. For example, ATs is a high frequency raise facing a 1/3 PSB on T72r, but is far less likely to be raised vs. a 100% PSB on the same board. As bet size decreases, the betting range becomes more merged, and therefore you can raise wider for value. That also means you raise more as a bluff because you have more value combos.

Online gaming not only promised a wide selection of games, mirroring that of a typical land based casino, but it also brought with it, rewards. When inside a casino, players often had access to some type of rewards card that could be inserted into a slot machine or handed to a dealer during table game play, in order to rack up points for play, which could later be redeemed for cash and/or rewards. Therefore, it only made sense for online casinos to implement a similar system. Welcome bonuses, regular promotions, and rewards programs became easily accessible for online players.

Idea 4: Maybe each line is an anagram. This is my best lead if I assume all my letters thus far are correct, however the punctuation on the German card would not support this action. One nice thing is that it does know words like "Gloomhaven" and "Inox", and it accepts wild cards. However, based on the German card, there's a good chance this is a wild goose chase. I also question how challenging this would be even once the runes translation card is provided. That's why I assume it's at least a safe bet that the entire card is not a giant anagram.

Nor is it clear that other police forces across the country, or in Southwestern Ontario, are likely to follow London lead.Megan Walker, executive director of the London Abused Women Centre (LAWC), had lobbied police for more than a decade to publicly release the names of accused johns, something only handful of Canadian police forces do.Police long countered they withhold those names even in human trafficking investigations because, in the end, most such suspects avoid a criminal record by attending a diversion program to educate them about the pitfalls of the sex trade industry.After Walker says police denied her freedom of information request for the names of the men charged in Project Circuit, a six week human trafficking sting that led to charges against 25 johns in the fall, she decided to take matters into her own hands.felt the only way we could determine what kinds of men are purchasing sexual services was to go and look at the court dockets every day, Walker said.Fabienne Haller, who also works at Walker organization, was tasked with swinging by the London courthouse every morning to check the dockets. 
Reiki was discovered in Japan during the early 1800's. There are variations of how it was discovered. I was taught, and continue to tell the story of Dr. Mikao Usui searching for how Jesus was able to heal people. I am not suggesting that this is how Jesus healed people. It is just part of the story. The story goes into the steps that he took to find it; who he met to help develop the practice, and the woman who would eventually bring it to America, thankfully!

It seems fairly common that drug use and depersonalization play into each other, but again, it something that will pass. You can bet on it letting up (I assume soon), and that in a not so distant future it will subside entirely. Once again, I felt as if the experience simply wouldn ever end.

For those of us old enough to remember the country devastating famine in 1984, this small snapshot of Ethiopia is a stark contrast.

Threats Unfortunately threats to the day spa business exist. One important consideration is the possibility that you might not be able to find or afford professional staff members certified in the treatments you would like to offer. Another potential problem, even with qualified personnel, is complaints from customers regarding such things as dissatisfaction with amount of product used, discomfort during a treatment and allegations of rude behavior from therapists. There is also the very serious possibility of lawsuits from customers who experience a reaction to a chemical, or suffer a burn or other injury at the premises.

People buy Bitcoin as an investment and they're right too. Again, I would encourage you to take a closer look at the technology. r/Bitcoin is a great place to start. Bitcoin has the capability to become much more widely adopted than it is now. It's nowhere near the level that Facebook is at in terms of use, but a better example is another payment network like Visa. Visa processes almost 150M transactions per day. Bitcoin processes 300k. Strictly talking valuation, Bitcoin's marketcap is at almost a billion dollars. It seems like a lot, but the value of all gold in the world is at 8.2T, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin's eventual value approach that. Bitcoin is also deflationary   there will only ever be 21M BTC. Of course it won't increase 1000x. But it will increase. Happy to discuss more if you want

Agree with badRLplayer. His examples are incredibly superficial. I would argue PGH has done an incredible amount of damage to the diversity of roles women are seen as capable of succeeding in. My wife (korean) fumes at how her incompetence or failure is at times portrayed as being related to her gender, often as an excuse put forth by her own ultraconservative supporters. I would argue that she was chosen almost entirely based on her connection to her father, rather than due to her quite meager legislative accomplishments prior to becoming president. So I believe her legacy is damaging to women who want to achieve in Korea through their hard work and ability.

The equities in Omaha run a lot closer together pre flop than in NL. I posted this hand to see all the Reddit poker trolls come out. My strategy in Omaha is putting max pressure on peoples stack. If I don 3/4 bet a lot, pots easily go 5 or 6 ways to a flop. This hand though was just some fun at the end of the night. I knew he had AA and when he bet to $300, I knew he wanted to play a big pot. This is why I flipped over an A and asked if he wanted to play a big pot. Most people in a 1/2 game aren willing to put their entire 1000bb stack in pre. I was debating with myself if I wanted to just gamble or fold. It an easy fold when I only have $105 of my $2000 stack in there. Another important concept is that this is a private SE Asia game and if you give action, then you get action. I would be surprised if any trolls in this post has had a 1000bb stack at any point, let alone willing to play a big pot with it. But yes, Omaha is the shit when your drinking.

Half of the population of the United States was found to consume less than the recommended amount of magnesium when estimated a decade ago (27). Not only is magnesium lost with certain medical conditions, but this mineral is excreted as a consequence of biological activities such as sweating, urinating, and defecating as well as excess production of stress hormones (7, 11). In addition, because low magnesium has been correlated with various disease states, increasing magnesium status may mitigate risk of these diseases..

Dr. Fasano and other experts speculate that once immune cells are mistakenly primed to attack gluten, they can migrate and spread inflammation, even to the brain.Indeed, Marios Hadjivassiliou, a neurologist in Sheffield, England, says he found deposits of antibodies to gluten in autopsies and brain scans of some patients with ataxia, a condition of impaired balance.Could such findings help explain why some parents of autistic children say their symptoms have improved sometimes dramatically when gluten was eliminated from their diets? To date, no scientific studies have emerged to back up such reports.Dr. Fasano hopes to eventually discover a biomarker specifically for gluten sensitivity.

I have most certainly urinated in public (if national parks are public) with children, had sex as a teenager, and gone streaking (as a teenager). What that means is that even more of us could be registered sex offenders than the 675,000 Americans already on the registries. That means our photos could be on there, our addresses, we could be targeted for harassment, threats, and in a few recent cases, vigilante style executions. Because so many offences require registration, the number of registered sex offenders in America has exploded.
Omaha Hi/Lo: As in Omaha Hi the player starts with 4 hole cards and similarly the player can only use 2 of them. But in Omaha Hi Lo the big difference is that you can have a high and a low winner in each hand. The player with the "high hand" wins the high (hand rankings according to Texas Hold'em) and the player with nothing "low hand" wins the low. The pot is split evenly between the High hand and low hand. In certain cases when there is no low winner the high hand takes all.

About a year ago, I found some free time, and started playing in a couple 1 2 NL hold games   my first poker in many years.

I know this is coming a bit late (I found your q while looking up something vaguely related), but I think it might be better for the mean time to spend less time with your father. That might mean cutting him out of uite life explicitly, but it would also mean just spending less time with him. Don seek his company out, have "plans with friends" just after when you meeting him (sorry, I can stay long, I meeting Emma this evening!), cancelling if you not up for it. Decreasing the time you spend with him will decrease his opportunities to say awful things. So will inviting friends along.

3. Betting with a mediocre hand on the river   even if you have a top pair, it usually isn't the smartest move to bet on the river. If you have the best hand with your top pair, you probably won't get called by anyone. If you don't have the best hand, you'll lose the bet or be forced to call a raise. For example: you hold Ace and a Queen 'off suit', and the flop was Queen of heart, Ten of clubs and 6 of clubs, the turn was 5 of heart, and the river is 8 of clubs   with this board it is not smart to bet.

Plenty of storage is provided by 24 inch deep drawers on the kitchen facing side and 12 inch deep cabinets with touch open and close on the opposite side. For informal family meals, the island 12 inch overhang provides enough space for the requisite five chairs.Instead of the more typical glossy tile backsplash, Jensen and Jest chose standard three by six inch subway tiles with a matte finish and installed a Caesarstone Pure White quartz countertop on the perimeter cabinets to maintain the consistency of the white tones.In a nod to the homeowners low maintenance guidance, the design duo selected one piece cabinet doors made from high density fibreboard. 
That's what the song says, and when it comes to playing poker, truer words could never be uttered. Poker isn't about winning every hand. In fact, sometimes you have to lose a few hands to win the game. Unfortunately, you cannot always know when to stay in and when to close out.

You can and should haggle your lease payment (and the rate can be marked up, just like financing), as it's by no means set in stone. Lease payments are a function of selling price, residual value (the price the factory buys the car for at the end of the lease), and money factor (the equivalent of interest rate). The only one of those that's set in stone is the residual rate.

As the judge observed, the wording in the act is but it is also very wide in its scope as to what constitutes income. In other words, it casts a very wide net and specifically includes gratuities received by a taxpayer. the taxpayer arguments that the tips should be tax exempt because they were gambling proceeds, the judge distinguished between the money won in the hands of the gambler and the money turned over to the attendant. A jackpot winner doesn have to pay tax on any winnings, but when part of these winnings are then paid to a casino employee in recognition of the services that the patron received, nature of that amount changes from being non taxable to a taxable amount in the hands of the employee. judge analogized the situation to a casino patron tipping a server in a restaurant using proceeds of his jackpot win. Clearly, the server tip would be taxable income to the restaurant employee and not deemed to be tax free gambling proceeds.

A family in my church had 12 brainwashed kids. I'm amazed they were never on the news for their shenanigans. They decided that the oldest daughter would be allowed to go to college. I was surprised at this and wanted to know all about it. She was going for business management and God had told the mother of this girl that she was going to open a "Christian family restaurant" that they would all work at. I asked what would specifically be Christian about it. She said it would have a dress code mainly for the women and only let in people who were modestly dressed. I waited to hear the rest but that was it. Sounded like a fun place. The girl ended up moving in with her boyfriend and scandalizing the family. By the time that occurred I was at a place in my evolution to feel happy for her.

Not really something he "said", however it was quite embarrassing. I took my 3 year old to a splash pad one day. For those unaware, a splash pad is usually located at a playground, and it essentially just a bunch of sprinklers. Anyways, parents usually sit to the side while the kids play.

So a few minutes go by and my son walks up to the man with a bucket of water, and before I can even realize what is going on, my son dumps an entire bucket of water on top of him. Keep in mind, he is wearing normal clothes and also had his cell phone in his hand. I wanted to vanish.

So, here what happened: we were offering a feed of /r/neography posts on the /r/conlangs official Discord server, so that users who were interested in the subreddit could know when a there was a new post. We've been running a feed of /r/conlangs for quite a while now as well (and in fact, had to amend our AutoMod for the same issue occurrent on /r/neography). The whole setup is quite similar to a multireddit in many respects: it allowed more integration into the community, particularly as /r/neography was positioned as the destination for script posts, after we decided to no longer allow them on /r/conlangs..

The phenomenon (once again, as I understand it) is an unwritten social norm requiring men to behave a certain way.

All of this porn has created a variety of "sex wars" over the dangers of porn. Some porn scholars and political activists have claimed that porn is in and of itself a form of sex discrimination since it doesn just represent men committing acts of violent sex against women, it encourages them to do so. Legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon once went so far as to suggest porn doesn just cause individual rape, but the systemic sort of rape committed by nation states like that committed by the Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. Other porn scholars have pooh poohed the idea that porn has real world effects or at least no more than any other form of representation, like advertising.

What are card games? How they came into existence? What were the key factors that caused card games to cause up a bang in the world of gambling? Well, the answer to all these queries is a cake to cut on. That means, as the name itself suggests, the games which are played with the liberal use of cards are known as card games. Now it depends on the contingency that the game is conventional or be contingent by the rules of the specified game.

Bad apples distract and drag down everyone, and their destructive behaviors, such as anger, laziness and incompetence, are remarkably contagious.

We purchased the property for $355,000, spent $40,000 on rehab costs, and turned the building around. It has doubled in value and cash flows phenomenally. We self manage the property and take immense pride for playing a role in gentrifying the area. Over a three year period while operating the rentals, I went the Dave Ramsey route and paid off any debt possible.

The Young Adult Forum, a 4.5 hour session Wednesday that was open only to the 25 and younger crowd, is part of the Aspen Institute's newest division and initiative to engage and involve younger people."We believe that young people need to be part of every conversation that talks about not only where the world is going, but talks about you," Rajiv Vinnakota, executive vice president of the Institute's Youth and Engagement Programs, said at the forum before 250 teenagers and young adults from around the world. "Why aren't you in the room when we're talking about issues that impact you?"A young and energetic audience   about half of whom call the Roaring Fork Valley home and half who traveled to Colorado from both urban and rural pockets globally   clapped and cheered wildly."We realized that there weren't enough young people who were actually engaging in all the issues, who were asking the hard questions," Vinnakota said.He said the forum is "the tip of the iceberg," as the Institute's Youth and Engagement Programs, which started early in 2016 under president and CEO Walter Isaacson's vision, offer 900 programs nationwide that focus on things such as leadership, civil discourse and empathy. Constitution to how technology is shaping young peoples' identities."For the next, say 10 or 15 years of your life, you're basically playing poker against yourself," Lovett said, illustrating his notion that adolescence is "a lot about fighting a little battle with yourself about what's great about you versus some of the stuff about yourself that you're working on."As an icebreaker, Lovett assigned the young folks to reveal their strengths and weaknesses to strangers and share them aloud with the audience.Without missing a beat, Lovett then assumed a more solemn tone in an attempt to impress one final thought on the young minds before him."Let's be honest, I don't care if you're Republican or Democratic," Lovett said, "This is a dark time. 
I remember when I was very new to Reddit there was a thread that asked women what something men don know about being a woman. The top response was (and this is as word for word as I can remember it), "I just came here to say that period shits are the worst." There were a handful of "you said it, girl" responses from women but man oh man reading the responses from the men had me dying. Genuine terror.

When I first started this column, I was pissed. Was still in office, two illegal and imperialistic wars were in full swing, and although the Wall Street Ponzi scheme built on the democratization of debt had not yet collapsed, it was increasingly clear that most of us had been screwed by Neoliberal capitalism.
