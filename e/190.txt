Allllllrighty then. Here some more science: We know (mostly) how sex chromosomes and genitalia work. We DON know very much about the human brain, which is where scientists generally consider gender identity to exist. We consider sex and gender to be separate things. There are no studies demonstrating that humans can only be one gender or the other, or that gender must always correlate with biological sex. I also really not sure how I am being selfish by wanting to allow other people to live peaceful happy lives that have no effect on me. I know mentioning credentials on Reddit is useless since it all anonymous, but I am in fact in the process of getting my PhD in biology, so I think I fairly qualified to have informed conversations about biology. Additionally, I not sure where you got the assumption that I don care about women in other countries. I do, and have donated to international women causes. I don want to get anything out of anybody. I just want everyone to be able to live happily without other people intruding on them or discriminating against them for something as harmless as gender expression.

In the documentary "Bitter Seeds," we witness the beginning of this cycle, with farmer Ram Krishna deciding to buy the Bt cotton (a genetically modified brand of seeds) instead of using his own natural seeds. Advertised as the cure for the farmers' small crops, the genetically modified seeds need more pesticides, water and fertilizer than the farmers can afford, creating shriveled and infested plants. But farmers keep falling for the advertised benefits and find themselves hopeless and glassy eyed from constantly worrying about their crops.

For comparison, I play online and have already played over 10k hands this week. So while all the examples above are just bad beats/coolers, I would continue to study your game and think about the smaller spots that you auto pilot or skim over because chances are you also have leaks that exist in your game or sometimes even become worse when dealing with a downswing. My advice would be to study more and think about the parts of your game that you can change.

It is also worth noting here that where I work we only work 5 days a week and within each sprint a day is lost to meetings like the demo, iteration planning meeting, retrospective and review so there is only 9 days to a sprint. Adding in pair programming for some things, time for fixing bugs and other non project work like support tickets and it becomes rather hard to say how many hours will be spent by the handful of developers in the sprint..

In thermodynamics, the term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo , derived from the word "endon" () meaning "within" and the root "therm" ( ) meaning "hot." The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on taking in heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, "gives out" energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat.

Suppose the rats are euthanized when their health starts to deteriorate, so they get close to 1 QALY per year. This would cost about $5 per rat per month plus an opportunity cost of maybe $500 per month for the time spent, which works out to another $5 per rat per month. Thus creating 1 rat QALY costs $120 per year, which is $240 per human QALY per year..

Over time this is combined with an unwillingness to look at the evidence, and a confirmation bias entrenched by 'safespace' sites similar in form to (but worse than) T_D, which cherrypick cases of Jewish misdeeds and published unsourced stories that minimise the Holocaust death count. Finally, sprinkle in a wimpish "but a well dressed man on YouTube said so and he seemed a good guy, he even told a joke or two. That would mean he's a liar.

Almost all poker sites offer various types of bonuses, but players should know that not all bonuses are created equal. They generally differ in size and the way a bonus is unlocked. To unlock a bonus you must know beforehand how many hands of poker you will play. Therefore, if you are not planning to play many hands, don't go for a $2,000 bonus. There are also bonuses that are very easy to unlock, but their amount isn't big.

A wall that partially uses natural features with the intent to completely seal off the border without (in their estimation) passable gaps is certainly coast to coast, bar irrelevant pedantry, and absolutely what he promised. His "big, beautiful wall" has shrunk from just over 1,000 miles, to just over 500. Given that there already about 700 miles of fencing, with massive gaps in barriers, and that fencing would largely need to be replaced in order to meet his various promises, how is 500 miles going to achieve his goal? Even if it did seal overland passage, smugglers already use legal ports of entry or underground tunnels, depending on what they smuggling.

Ernie Scherer Police were able to eliminate Charlene and Ernest's close circle of friends as suspects, but the one person they could not eliminate was their son, Ernie. Ernie gave police a very weak alibi for the night they believe his parents were killed. at his Brea home, almost 400 miles from the crime scene. His wife, Robyn, and their son were visiting her family in Sacramento and he was home alone. Ernie offers to investigators that they can track his movements from Las Vegas to Brea, Calif., through credit card charges and cell phone records. But investigators looking at those records find a 17 hour time gap when they believe Ernie committed the murders of his parents.
Eventually, he accepts that even though the professor is not particularly likeable, he prepares students for the kind of "hand to hand combat" they will face after they graduate. "College professors don't have to be warm and fuzzy or outwardly entertaining," he recognizes. "If they can stimulate students to attack new ground vital to future understanding of a subject matter, if they can drag them through the labyrinth of a complex topic and come out of that maze on sure footing, then their charges will have earned their knowledge the hard way.". 
An analysis of spending in Category 2 spending last financial year found that $37.9 million worth of claims were submitted by clubs for "sport".

Making it worse is there are constantly on break and off shift dealers sitting games and they will tip dealers $12 in a $25 $30 pot. Money is siphoned off the table like I have never seen. I do not get in hands with dealers because of this, but it still sucks to see other players stacks get worked.

The actual sex was fine, even if she didn put much into it, because again she looked and felt great, and while not enthusiastic, she didn object to anything.

I posted a number of bits in this blog about stupendously large and enormously small things, but it is infrequent to find the story of something made exceptionally large in a reduced world. Perhaps it is normal fare in the science fiction world, but I found the not obvious but still obvious making of a giant in microland to be, well, less than obvious. Have been countless stories told of shrinking people, or the discovery of vastly small communities living withing a larger host community, and so on, like the following:.

Spaying or neutering a dog also has a positive effect on behavior. If there's a female dog in heat practically anywhere in the known universe, an unaltered male dog will know it. He'll try to get out, roam far and wide, mark your furniture and other things with urine, and may become overly aggressive. An unspayed female goes through the mess of heat (estrus) about twice a year, during which she may also try to escape or become more unpredictable in her behavior. Without the ebb and flow of those hormonal tides, spayed and neutered dogs are more consistent in their temperament   which makes training easier   yet their zeal in protecting you and your home is undiminished.

The good news is, it can get better, but it's going to take a LOT of work on your end to tune out/ignore people's reactions. I would also recommend role playing (with a therapist if you have one, close friend or family member if you don't) some responses to have on hand when people's reactions get out of hand or when you encounter an access issue. My hope would be that by preparing yourself, the anxiety when you actually encounter a situation in real life would be less.
The first of these propositions is a version of an argument that is heard often on the Left and occasionally on the Right, too: that the West must not its own system of values the ideals of democratic government and personal freedom on other societies. It goes something like this: if people choose to live under totalitarianism, even with a regime that tortures them or denies them the right to life itself, we have no licence to inflict our model of society upon their alien culture. It may be hard for us (with our parochial fondness for freedom and basic human rights) to understand such attitudes but it is not our business to judge and intervene. I have always found this view bizarre, quite apart from the fact that it often arises precisely when there is clear resistance to those tyrannies from sections of their own populations.

For years, American political institutions have apparently been in a state of near paralysis (the qualifier   "apparently"   is intended to convey the fact that the system is working just fine for the top few percent, who for the past several decades have appropriated most of the benefits generated by economic growth). For example, in April 2011 the government was nearly forced to shut down all non essential federal services and furlough 800,000 federal employees because Congress refused to pass a budget. Later that year, on August 2, 2011, with the US only hours away from reaching the deadline to avoid defaulting on the federal debt, Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling.

Reality usually had a way of intervening. ButI knew one senior reporter who would play solitaire on his computer in the mornings, waiting for his editors to come through with marching orders.

I don believe the current political and economic system in China will be able to govern China into a higher middle income country. China will get stuck soon. However large parts of China is still really poor and there is much growth to be added there if they are able to make those poor farmers more productive. I know the lowest pensions in the country side in Chongqing is merely 100 RMB per month, with almost no medical coverage (only 30 procent on certain services and medicines). Think about that, that is dirt poor. But I don know how they will be able to bring those up to a higher income segment. Jobs will soon start to disappear due to robots, AI and productivity improvements and will probably hit China pretty hard. More and more is going online as well and many people will go out of business.

It a different beast altogether now. The books from before should still be able to teach a beginner the very basics, but I would suggest looking up any random YouTube video instead. There are some very high production value videos out there where the creators have put in a lot of time and effort into their product. These guys aren't wrong, some of the books, especially related to online and MTT strategy aren't helpful today. But that doesn't mean everything in them is wrong. No different than reading a business/management book from years ago. Maybe the application has changed (betting 2.3 2.5x to open in a MTT vs betting 3 4x) but the principle hasn't (if it's worth playing, open). I also like to think deeply about each concept so a chapter in a book, read at my own pace, serves me better than a quick video of the same content. Strictly preference at that point though.

But studies of everything from romantic relationships to workplace encounters show that negative interactions can pack a much bigger wallop than positive ones.

If both hands are exactly the same except for the kicker (A,A,3,3,6 and A,A,3,3,2) the kicker will determine the winner. Cards are ranked at face value, Ace can be either the highest or lowest card, depending on the hand. All others are ranked from 2, lowest, to King, highest. If the two pair is the only two pair hand, the value of the kicker is irrelevant as the two pair will win over a high card hand. If the players both have two pair, the highest pair will win regardless of the kicker.
