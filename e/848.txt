At the very least, it gets the ball rolling and establishes to others that what going on is clearly wrong. I been in situations where I didn realize someone was being picked on until someone else tried to deescalated the situation verbally, and then things were able to be solved physically. Hate it when people make fun of others for trying to do the right thing, that such a bad attitude to have.

If I were to be super bad, I would lose the majority of my matches. If I good, I win instead. The key here is that an average player wins 50% of the time. New players should begin at the average GSP so they can move up or down accordingly. 1.2 mil is an arbitrary number, but it works because everyone starts there and can move up or down as they play. If we all started at 0, there be no room to move down. This could still function as a system, but it just not how Nintendo decided to do it due to the pros and cons.

What does raising the turn really achieve though? The only hands you fold out are the ones with no equity anyway are they not? Obviously you want to be trying to keep all the bluffs in there. Most strong drawing hands like flush draws will still call the raise then lead out river if they miss, there are some hands that picked up equity like K10 or 97 (which i guess you have some fold equity against when you raise), then 9 10 made the nuts. I suppose you get extra value from a hand like QJ. Theres a small percentage of the time when the utg player is trying to trap with QQ or JJ. Is jamming turn fine given the small raise from the button? Idk, I kind of just thinking aloud here I really not the best player myself. Any thoughts on my thoughts?

A sloppy flat singletrack course kicks off the 6 part series in Lane County Oregon. It a fun flat course but it always such a slop fest. There are 4 distances that all share the loop so it gets more and more thrashed throughout the day. I ran my first 2 miles faster than I should have and my first 5.4 mile loop felt like it was over in the blink of an eye. I ate a stinger gel and downed some sports drink before I headed out on my second loop. I was really starting to struggle by mile 8 but it was one of those rare days I was able to keep my head in the zone and suffer through the last couple of miles. I was hoping to come in under 1:30 and I ran a 1:29:58!

Then after the 9 lost matches everything went back to normal, we were allowed to have average players on our team again because our winrate got balanced out.

Bond skills work great on Soren. Atk/Spd is perfect, I've been using Atk/Res because I don't have the required fodder. For his other skills, I strongly recommend a chill for his B slot. Chill speed is perfect, but he could easily run chill res too if you have a spring catria. As for C skills, they're flexible, but his chills already enable him to be great support and he wants to be by allies anyway, so depending on team composition I recommend using tactics or wave skills. If you go for tactics, you can run two on him if you give him one of the tactic seals. Otherwise his seal is pretty flexible. That makes him a fantastic support unit, and no slouch in battle.

Huppert's resulting performance is a careful balancing act, one in which she refuses to soften the hard edges of the unpredictable lead character in a film that, as she notes, "gives you more hypotheses" than answers.

Endlessly complex, the Elle protagonist is, per Huppert, "a new heroine. She has the ways of overcoming whatever: her shame, her guilt." And observations that the actress makes about Michle could equally apply to Nathalie in Things to Come: "She's a solitary woman. She's fearless, also. That's what makes her interesting." Fearless: just like the actress herself.

How does Deku have a better shot here than in round 2? When Deku first gets his powers he could only do use OFA a single time before completely breaking the used limb. He would need to get a solid hit the first try to win this. Contrary to popular belief, MCU Spider Man does still have a spider sense, it just not as refined as it is in the other films. Deku only takes this round if Spidey stands still and tries to tank the punch. Otherwise, Spidey recognizes Deku punch is a massive danger and just webs him from afar. Spidey 9/10 or possibly 10/10.

Poker unlike any other casino card game can be played against other people and no against the house. 
For example, there is a player who hasn played a hand in the first hour while you been sitting. Now preflop, someone calls, a couple of players fold and then he raises. Do you know his exact hand? No. But you can start narrowing it down. He probably has something good since he seems tight. He probably doesn have 73 or J2. He might have QQ or AK. So maybe his range is TT+, AQ+.

You must great at fishing 'cause you've caught me hook line and sinker. We have previously hosted popular speed dating evenings, dance classes, comedy nights and guided walks in central London. In this friendly environment, we give you the opportunity in a single evening to meet a wide variety of other singles with similar values and beliefs. We will then rotate the men, and continue the rotations until every Christian single man has met every Christian single woman present. No awkward silences, no looking at the watch, no time to worry about whether your date will look like your favourite film star and unlike buses, another will be right along in ten minutes! If there is a Christian speed dating match between any two attendees, the organizers forward this info to the Christian speed daters, along with contact information. If you were a new hamburger at McDonald's, you would be McGorgeous. After the speed dating portion of the evening, we will provide more time for mixing and mingling, where you can enjoy the cash bar while reconnecting with those you met during the speed dating portion of the evening. Online dating is a great way to find and connect with other Christians that you might otherwise never cross paths with.

As I've said before, people love to run with myths, and sadly, this one is self sustaining: The misinformation brings a lot of vitriol, the vitriol prompts removals, and the removals result in more misinformation.

Molly is a bit like that. As portrayed by Jessica Chastain, this driven, brilliant woman was on her way to Olympic glory when a freak accident took her out of competition. She had the grades to get into law school, but decided to take a year off first, and wound up running a high stakes poker game in Los Angeles. Early in the movie, we see Molly taking on the services of Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), one of those incorruptible lawyers movies are so good at providing. (Film shorthand: He got a sweet school age daughter so we know he on the level.) He urges her to turn on her former clients in exchange for a lighter sentence, but she has principles too! Even the movie doesn give the real names of any of the players, although it an open secret that the smarmy young actor played by Michael Cera is, in fact, Tobey Maguire.

Social theorist Pierre Bourdieu would have described calling anti choice activists pro life as a form of "symbolic violence." For Bourdieu, the symbolic order of things is a way of keeping the status quo in place. economy and culture rely on symbolic violence as a way of getting us to either ignore social inequality or to accept it as natural. the term "pro life" in supposedly objective journalism is a form of violence that marks those opposed to abortion rights as "ethical" and those in support of abortion rights as unethical sorts, selfish and self interested people who just want "choice" as if it the same as deciding between flavors of ice cream.

Despite the game of Po Ke No resembling bingo quite heavily there are a couple of key differences that distinguish Po Ke No from bingo. In Bingo, random numbers are drawn and if they match the number on a players card the players marks his or her game board accordingly. In Po Ke No however, this is not the case. In Po Ke No instead of a random number being drawn, a person, known as a dealer, employs use of a standard deck of 52 cards, jokers not included. The dealer draws cards from the deck and if the card corresponds with a space on a player's game board they cover that space.
