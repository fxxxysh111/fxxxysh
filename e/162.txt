I don know what there is in this engraving that speaks "color" to me when it should probably be just concerning itself with the blackness of its deep black (which for me is usually the case). Neither the blackness nor the dimensionality of the thing it seems to give itself some height and depth at the same time say anything louder than the representation of its missing colors, which we are clearly seeing nothing of in these wavelengths except that there really aren any colors here outside of the beautiful black white. Contrast is certainly there ("There are dark shadows on the earth, but its lights are stronger in the contrast." Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers), especially in the corner bits, where on closer inspection the blackness is really more white than black.

But they edit it in the show and pull a clip of him saying "flattened" from elsewhere in testimony, and in the show it looks like he says "I saw what appeared to be a flattened bullet." Isn that nuts? Like what even is the point of pulling out this one word from elsewhere, removing words from his testimony, splicing "flattened" into the middle of a sentence, then editing the visual they were using to cut away from his face so you wouldn see they just put words in his mouth? That how intent they were on hiding even a modicum of truth, and mislead the viewer to think the bullet was flattened and damaged and couldnt be matched to a gun, when of course it was matched to the exact rifle hanging over Avery bed.

Memorial Day is obviously an important ritual, but not to remember fallen soldiers, which seems to have been its original intent (although the historical record is somewhat unclear on who started it and whether it was to remind ourselves that the costs of war are too high or just to make heroes of those who had died as soldiers). In any event, the fact is that Memorial Day has become a ritual of summer, a way to mark the beginning of the season of swimming pools, bbqs, and to at least imagine that our lives have more leisure in them. As a seasonal ritual, a time to break from Spring and work to Summer and relaxation, it is extremely useful for national solidarity (it what Americans do) as well as solidarity within our own social networks.

Wow, what an episode. So, my conspiracy theory is that it no accident that those Gilead security guys caught Nick and June at the safe house where they went to meet Hannah. My assumption was only strengthened by the wide panning shot at the end of the episode that shows the house is essentially in the middle of an isolated area at the top of a snowy mountain without many houses or people around, meaning that the fact that the security guys caught Nick and June like 3 minutes after they came outside and less than 15 minutes after they arrived at the safe house is awfully convenient timing.

If you're in an office, other people may well just infect you with their stress. If you're at home revising, you probably associate your desk with all that brain ache. Getting outside can be very helpful. Fresh air and quiet help your mind stop focusing on how awful everything is, and instead you can start logically cataloguing what can be done, and accepting those jobs that can't. A brisk walk can help to burn off some of the physical energy that your adrenaline has been building up, and, if you've been using a computer all day, looking out at distant objects gives your eyes a handy chance to relax.

While this might be considered a corollary to customizability, I think it is actually a bit deeper because it can support diversity within the same system, not just one really specific set of options.

One caution: Even a skilled player on 100 percent plus machines will have more losing sessions than winners. Those percentages assume that over the long haul the player will hit a normal share of royal flushes with full coins played. Royal flushes are expected about once every 40,000 hands   about once every 80 hours of play. There are no guarantees, however. Without a normal number of royal flushes, or if fewer than the maximum number of coins are played, the payout percentages will be lower.

Turning point: Late in the first quarter, the Buffs trailed 14 7, but had just picked off an ASU pass. The offense couldn't capitalize, though, and punted. ASU blocked the punt and got the ball at the CU 11. Four plays later, the Sun Devils kicked a field goal, took a 17 7 lead and never looked back. It was another in a long line of Pac 12 blowout losses, and it extended CU's conference losing streak to 13 games.

Things that don make a whole lot of sense for characters or factions happen all the time because the gameplay side of things needs new enemies/factions to fight, so the storytelling has to adjust to that   Sylvanas didn burn down Teldrassil because she always secretly hated the Night Elves for exiling her people or something, she did it because Blizzard decided they needed a big event to galvanize the playerbase, kick off the faction war, and give them an excuse to nuke old, outdated capitols to pave the way for them to be either updated or replaced by new ones. Sylvanas was used as the catalyst for this. Essentially Blizzard does their writing backwards, they come up with what they need to happen and then bend, force, or retcon the story and characters to justify it. This results in functional writing (as in, everything is passably justified if given a cursory glance) but doesn hold up very well and makes the world seem a bit awkward.

Although we can interact with anyone, we still respond most quickly to our closest friends. We now know many more people, but we haven forgotten which members of our circle really matter.. 
But when it comes to trips, I one bourgeois motherfucker when it comes to hotels and restaurants. If it Europe, we try to find the most charming small boutique hotels we can, and in a US city, we stay in rich asshole elegant older hotels like the Waldorf or Algonquin in New York or the Ritz or Roosevelt in New Orleans, and the Drake in Chicago is pretty decent.

If the name is super off it won't know what it is.Over the last season or two, the stories have been getting really middling at best.

We called the police, and despite the station being only two blocks away, and knowing that there were always three squad cars patrolling in a four block radius since it's the busiest party street in town, it took them 45 minutes to show up and go "Oh, why isn't anything happening anymore" at a bar that has been shot up multiple times in the past.

But the subtler digs (her primary specialty) were more difficult to describe. I have seemingly benign conversations with my Nmom, yet later that day my anxiety would show up and stay there. It was little comments that could be taken either way about questioning my life skills, discouraging success, making me worry, making me feel like I crazy and about to abuse her at a moment notice..

However a recent Federal court ruling that poker is a game of skill, not chance, has opened the door to legalizing online poker in some states. Just six days ago, May 1, 2013, Nevada became the first state where people at least 21 years old could legally play poker online for money.. 
That is, if it didn't end up being a total and complete embarrassment, which this would have a high likelihood of being. 
I say let start by updating our definitions for what you can label "news." Fox News is just state run political propaganda. Just nothing but a spin machine for a particular ruling party. How many outright lies and deceits need to be proven before they can no longer have "NEWS" in big letters plastered all over their network? They have a right to exist, sure, but they are nothing but pure spin and should be treated with the same journalistic respect as say, a high school newspaper or the comments section of a youtube video. 
I know Australia is far from perfect. I was just pointing out that I didn know a country like Ireland would have a legal system which takes the side of a rapist the way it did in this specific case.

In the matter of the SBP autonomy, both the minister of finance and the IMF mission give mere lip service to it in their deliberations. They pay no attention to the violation by the government of both the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Law and the SBP Act. The hollow statements of the IMF about SBP autonomy are repeated for cosmetic purposes.

Sports massage professionals, much like anything else in the UK, do have professional governing bodies.

Langsam kam er mit seinen Fingerkuppen dem Zentrum nher, jetzt umrundete er diese Spitzen mehrmals, die Fingerspitzen auf dem dunklen Vorhof berhrend, Helens Kopf neige sich etwas nach hinten, wie wenn sie ihm ihre Brste entgegenstrecken wollte, und Carlos' Daumen und Zeigfinger fassten jetzt diese dunklen Knospen, drckten sie leicht, etwas hin und her drehend. Sofort wurden die Knospen hart, grsser, der dunkle Vorhof wellte sich, tiefe Furchen bildeten sich dort.

Restaurants are a major source of anxiety for me. I always take note of where the restrooms are located and heaven forbid it is a single bathroom with a waiting line. Ironically, my first episode was in a Vegas casino restaurant which does not have restrooms. Like a rat hunting cheese in a maze, you need to search for a restroom in a casino since they are designed to keep you on the floor gambling.
