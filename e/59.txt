Also Santana is much weaker than the other three. For starters he has no special ability, also he was unable to absorb pre hamon trained Joseph. Whereas Wham just straight up sticks his finger in Joseph neck. It also took an additional 30 days of intensive training for Joseph to stand (no pun intended) a chance against the pillarman. Also Stands are now so op that he wouldn stand a chance. How could he deal with the likes of Star Platinum, when he wouldn be able to see him, or Heirophant Green, hell even The Hand would get him because he wouldn see it coming. I am aware Santana was defeated through Joseph luck, but he never should have left the base during the day.

Also, for what it worth, the applications I done with this "pseudo" redundancy shared the same PID controlled equipment. Ours had a lag time on the order of minutes in between input and reaction, so we got away with just turning off the PID control on the standby controller and then turn it on when it became the master controller. Worked well. Still worth bringing up the risks with the end client as clearly as possible.

The reason parliamentary democracies have a bureaucratic machine that helps fill out positions like ambassadors is because parliamentary democracies are messy places where millions of different opinions converge. In foreign affairs, a professional corps of diplomats reduces the element of chance by producing an army of highly trained, poker faced operators whose bloodstream is resplendent with "national interest." You can go wrong with a Maleeha Lodhi, or a Wajid Shamsul Hasan or a Husain Haqqani. But you can't go wrong with civil servants you've never heard of.

Not just advertising, but the film and TV industries have learned to deploy an entire array of technologies that make us want to look like people who do not exist in the real world.

Sometimes I grind online really hard for a few months and others I just let myself fall behind the skill curve and play live for a while because its easy money (though I enjoy it much less). The lifestyle playing online is amazing. Work your own hours, no boss, etc. Playing live is much more like a regular job. Commute to work, sit on a list for a while, make friendly with co workers, suck up to the boss (floor man), etc. I do like the social aspect sometimes but more so when I traveling and not playing with the same shithead regulars every day. If I played more live I would certainly make a lot more money but not sure its worth it for the reasons mentioned.

The propofol hasn had time to be completely metabolized by the liver in 10 minutes, but it did have time to be redistributed to fatty tissues.If you give an anesthetic continuously for longer periods of time, you can actually build up a TON of anesthetic in your fatty tissues, and they will start leeching anesthetic back into your blood stream.Isoflurane is highly lipid soluble, and anesthesiologists know that if you give isoflurane continuously to an obese patient for a 10 hour case, they gonna have to wake the patient up in the ICU several hours after the surgery is over.

The LinesThe lines on the court are marked out so it is easy to see where the boundaries of the court are. On grass courts, the lines are done in chalk, so if a ball lands plumb on a line, chalk flies up and marks the ball, reducing disputes over line calls. That is the theory, but put into practice, this is not always the case.

As far as moisturizers go, I like The Ordinary's NMF a lot, as I found it very gentle (it was one of very few moisturizers that didn't hurt my Accutane skin). Stratia Liquid Gold is a favorite around here, for good reason   it has exactly the kinds of ingredients that help heal painfully damaged skin. It's what I'm using now that I'm on retin a.

Players at that stake (if they are even around) are the most qualified to answer that question, but since you asked it here where the quantity of them may be low, I will offer a guess. I imagine strong 50/100 players have an incredibly solid foundation of the basic fundamentals of poker, such as being able to recognize the GTO line in the majority of spots, as well as to identify their opponents play based off of their tendencies rather quickly so that they can deviate to more exploitative play. This enables the solid players to unleash their arsenal of moves including squeezing, defending, floating, barreling, 3betting light, overbetting, donking, etc. Of course, these plays are certainly seen in 1/2, they are just performed incorrectly at a much higher frequently. The biggest thing by far that I expect 50/100 players do that 1/2 players aren doing is folding instead of limping.

2. SO WHY THE DELAY FROM LAST YEAR?I talked with lead designer Danny Belanger about what led to the postponement of Watch Dog 2013 release. He said, simple answer was that it wasn't ready. It wasn't done. We were at the point that we made some bad decisions. We cut corners. I thought the game would have suffered. We wanted to take the time to deliver what we promised. specifically, he said that the AI needed work. The reaction from the people and other systems wasn realistic. He said there wasn enough variety. To fix that, Ubisoft Montreal reworked the difficulty and polished the mission design. The version we played wasn final but I could see how sometimes the AI didn react convincingly. For example, during a mission where Aiden had to chase down a prank caller, I basically destroyed half of downtown Chicago while chasing after the culprit. It takes a while to adjust to the handling of the vehicle. The cars in Watch Dogs feel weightier. I actually preferred using motorcycles.

Are you sure your manager wasn just simply saying that they didn need the note, not that they didn accept that you were out sick? I not in HR, but I am a manager. My organization policy is that you only need a doctor note if you out for 3 or more consecutive days of work   I could see myself in the same situation of returning the note to the employee, seeing they were on the phone and just saying quickly "hey, we don actually need this." Granted, it nearly impossible to tell tone over the internet, and having struggled with anxiety as well, I know it also suuuper easy to misinterpret matter of fact speech into "omg my boss hates me I such a fuckup what did I do," when in actuality they just didn require a note.

Poker is a lot like a waiting game: Most of the time, a player receives more bad hands than good, but once the strong hands come, if a player plays smart they can reap the rewards (depending on what they are playing for, of course). It is also a game of strategy. Sometimes, bad hands can serve a player a silver platter.

I appreciate him so much because he makes that vision at least a little easier to see in our future.

The Rockets shot the lights out in the fourth, and when Harden drilled a three with just under six minutes to play, the long bomb was Houston's seventh three pointer of the quarter, and gave the visitors a 14 point lead.

I am the result of two living cells. One from each of my parents. They are the result of two living cells, one from each of their parents. I wasn just born. I am a continuation of life. I am a living thing that reaches back into time perhaps 400 million years and the result of billions of joining of pairs of cells. It is possible that if you were to follow my cells back to my parent's cells and beyond that my family tree touches every living thing here on earth. That is if we limit ourselves to believing life was created here on earth. If it rained down from the immensity of the universe it could reach back into that immensity of time and space, and who knows what relationships and who knows what species.

Though, if you don think they ever have bluffs in their range, blocking 54 isn a good thing since that just leaves them with higher aces, so you should shift A5 and A4 to other higher aces. I think they could conceivably have bluffs here though, like turning any x3 or x2 into a bluff would be pretty baller. 2 points  submitted 11 days ago.

I feel bad for my drivers when they out there, but unless the owner calls it, the show must go on. Truth is, if you a good driver, and if good drivers are scarce there, your manager probably won fire you for telling him/her you can do it.

Do be wary of using the dictionary only for your vocab look up from your native language to Korean. I used to look a lot at examples in naver dictionary mostly to make sure that the Korean word I found dictionary is used in the right context. Sometimes you can look up grammar too. Like if you want to say "I would done it but I couldn and you don know the grammar needed for that, look up " I would have but" in the examples and read what they have and see which ones match what you mean and plug it in. For more conversational examples, make sure to check the vlive examples.

Females generally have lower maintenance calories than men so if they ate exactly the same theyd be in a higher caloric surplus and therefore gain more fat. You can just eat whatever you want to bulk up, you do need to hit certain calorie and nutrient goals, but the "unhealthy" foods your friend eats are probably in line with that. You could probably eat the same things, just with smaller portions and you see similar results..

However, he might have other reasons, for Mr. Hicks, being ashore the day before, the natives would not permit him to go into the Woods. This made me resolved to go and see whether they meant to prescribe bounds to us or no.

If you are like me and have trouble following along with the proofs, then you may just want to skip to the results in some of the chapters. Chapters 10 through 21 are the meat of this book, and the basis for Game Theory in Poker, which is the 1 reason I bought this book.

So I was very happy yesterday as we traversed the streets of our neighborhood to have a "teachable moment" as we discussed why, on a blazing hot day, so many women were wearing hijab.

The description I had on imgur isn showing up so here the story. Knight that was on sale. I warned him when he said FedEx was the delivery service because I had dealt with their shitty service back in November and they just do not care. I still haven gotten a response from them on it! Any time you talk to a delivery person or customer service, they act completely apathetic and sometimes hostile. This time they blamed it on not having a big enough distribution center in the area (true, now fix it!) so they don care about dragging ass on residential deliveries because they have to focus on the business deliveries because they so small. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Anyways, he asked them to deliver as promised, and they seem to have taken it out on the box. It has a fluorescent orange sticker marking it FRAGILE on the front, and they maimed it so hard the collector friendly packaging has been bent and ruined. For the record, there is a small business across the street, so it not like we outside of their business delivery area.

I do want to ask how you expect anyone to possibly change your view on this. For example, between a person who wants to split a cake 50/50 and another person who wants the cake all to himself, wouldn the be recommending a 25/75 split? And in this case this is clearly not the vast majority of complex issues worth debating have 2 genuinely defensible stances; these issues wouldn be worth debating otherwise. On these issues, I would argue that the moderate viewpoint tends to be more enlightened compared to a stance on either of the extreme ends simply because the moderate position genuinely considers the merits of both sides and ultimately weighs these merits and cons to arrive at a qualified moderate position (ideally).

The biggest difference between a tournament and a normal game is that once your chips are gone, you are out of the tournament. In a regular game, you have the option to buy more chips at any time between hands. This makes tournament strategy a little different. Some players simply want to place in the money while others play to win. The obvious question is why doesn't everyone play to win? The answer has to do with the variance associated with two different playing styles.

Further research has found that the pathways used by pain impulses excite not only the areas of the brain that experience physical sensation, but also those associated with emotion and cognition [source: Chapman]. Pain is not only a physical experience; the association of cognition   higher awareness   and emotion attach meaning to the experience of pain. These additional features of pain appear to help humans create more refined memories of a painful experience, which may help keep the person from repeating it in the future [source: Ackerman]..

"I take my two cards and put a chip on them, not looking at my cards until it is my turn. As the action goes around the table, watch what the other players do. Based on the betting and the action, you make a plan with what you are looking for and what you will do, before you look at your cards. This method prevents people from picking up your tells. But, you can't just pick up the cards blind when it is your turn, and then contemplate for minutes on how to play your cards. You must have a plan before it is your turn. If you make a small raise instantly, you could have anything. The trick is to have a plan and act quickly.

"The performance was decent, but it is a worry that we aren creating. If we had been beaten 1 0 with 11 men I would have taken that because we probably weren good enough to break them down. I thought that for 25 minutes in the second half we were starting to create one or two half chances and I don think we were helped when we went down to 10 men because our backs were to the wall then. Even with 10 men we tried to play and tried to create.

If your goal is to become a winning Texas Hold'em player, this section is invaluable. As stated above, the most important decision you make as a Hold'em player is whether or not to enter the pot (or play for the pot). Almost all losing Hold'em players play far too many hands. Winning Hold'em players see the flop only between 20 and 25 percent of the time. Let's think about that statement for a minute. Considering the fact that 10 percent of the time you will be in the big blind, which will often let you see the flop for free, if you are to be a winning player, you won't enter many other pots   only one to one and a half on average each round other than when you are the big blind.

Craigslist entered into the agreement with 40 attorneys general, including Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto, to clamp down on illegal services being offered online. And the shrinking number of erotic services ads are a clear victory for law enforcement, at least on the surface.

You sure you got that the right way around? GTA is well known within the PC gaming community to always be lower due to cpu bottlenecking except at 4k, and I doubt he just casually hitting 4k 144hz. Regardless of which it taxing though, Hearthstone is a game that runs just as well on mobile phones with few changes aside from having no choice in graphical settings.
