It never bad to have more knowledge, but in poker the correct application of knowledge is more important. Personally, I don know why you would worry about playing GTO if none of your opponents are able to exploit you, except to have knowledge to be a better overall player for when you move up in stakes and start facing opponents who could exploit you.
In poker, a showdown is the laying down of one cards, face up, to determine the winner of that hand.

But reliability here means the repeatability of performance year over year (or, I suppose, week to week if you prefer); QB TDs seem to be at least moderately reliable year over year for QBs that finish a full season with the same team.

Even capitalist countries have state enterprises, but that doesn mean they working towards socialism. Again, to be able to say "they were working towards that end", you should show me a case where they expropriated the means of production and put into the hands of the worker class.

The only thing is that you can get some of the better, suited poker felt for less than $15 per linear yard, and you should need more than 3 linear yards in almost every case. This is a small price difference when you think of it in those terms. Don't think that the green felt most commonly used is not acceptable   it is just that it can look old quickly and it is not as durable or long lasting. Some of the newer materials are tough and stain resistant, which adds life to this material.
Long story short, regarding the bakery. Leida gave them the runaround regarding payment for "cupcakes". 
Judging from your comments in this thread, you have a bad attitude about dating, you seem to have an inflated self worth ("I have so much more going for me in my life than most guys",) and you complain that the only women you can get to hook up with you are "so so." You probably just a normal person who thinks he more attractive and charismatic than he is; you are only pursuing women out of your league and then thinking "IT THEIR FAULT THEY NOT INTO ME!" In my opinion, you don need a dating coach, you need to turn the mirror on yourself. If you haven had success while actively pursuing a relationship in ten years, that indicates that the problem in this equation is most likely not women but, rather, you..

Obviously white people (tall, blonde) have experienced all kinds of shit, like restaurant owners telling them they using chopsticks wrong. One of my coworkers was reading a book while eating, and the restaurant owner marched over, slammed his book shut, and told him not to do that.another coworker was cuddling his Korean girlfriend in the subway (it was cold), when an old guy came over, called him a thief and her a prostitute.generally the older generation have this really old fashioned mindset, and it feels like the younger generation is just kinda waiting for them to die off.

I swear to fucking god, these baby rabies MILs and their intense desire to feed "their baaaaby" a fun little dolly meal that they can mix up themselves like a little mommy. I'm reminded of those creepy plastic infant dolls with a plastic hole mouth that fits a bottle full of dolly baby meals. It's like MIL has lost all interest in the normal things that should occupy a woman in her age group, and has regressed all the way back to a 5 year old playing dollies with a real, live do over baby.

From a PIO perspective, OOP should be checking his whole range on this flop. IP will mix with JTss but probably preferring to get with BdFd. Your sizing is slightly small for this texture, half pot would be better but isn't going to change the EV that much. Turn bet is reasonable as the 7c interacts with your range much more than villains and is good for your hand as well. Against a raise you have a clear call and will evaluate river but likely fold unimproved to a river jam

The biggest piece of advice on writing a meaningful letter about what she does for you as a student, is to not only talk about what was great about her and her teaching (with examples!), but also what impact the class had on you, your understanding of the material, your perspective, your thoughts about your future within the field, other classes, future professions, etc. In my opinion, the strongest and most meaningful praise I have gotten from students has been the praise regarding the "big picture" and the lasting impact I had on students. Those letters give me the strongest warm fuzzies, and are the things that are most helpful to me for retention and tenure reviews.

What about professional books? I doubt that copies of Newton, Galileo, Copernicus, and so on have traveled very much on their own (though the ideas contained in them are probably among the best traveled of that sort), but I suspect that anatomies (Vesalius, Gray) have some miles in them. 
Some of them like myself are self taught and really consider ourselves just really good humans who happen to know engineering as well as cooking and other skills. Some of us don understand why other humans don bother learning what seem like essential skills for life.

I could be wrong about this, but I seem to remember reading on here a while back that CDPR was paying another development studio to provide assistance with the development of the game. This studio is only known for doing multiplayer game modes, and so would likely be doing a lot of the work on the multiplayer for Cyberpunk. If this is the case, then almost all of CDPR energy is still going to the singleplayer, but they will also be able to have a multiplayer mode for those who want it..

Actually I would love to hear from you about what you are aware of in social situations. Do you find that there are times that you have no idea about your posture, your conversational partners posture. How about, do you know where his/her eyes have been looking at for the past 5 minutes? how often where they looking at you, looking in your eyes, looking to the side but down to the floor, looking to the side and across the room, towards some other group, looking down at your feet. My guess is that you probably are not nearly as aware of this as [non labeled] people. You can expand that to, what they mouth is doing/has been doing. Their forehead. Their cheeks and corners of eyes (where you can tell if they are making a true smile or not). Their face overall. The angle of their heads.

Everyone else is vastly overrating the importance of skill. Culture matters more than skill. Women tennis is an obvious profitable and pretigious competition that does well despite not being the apex of the sport. College football vs the NFL another.

The whole marketing consumer complex of our economy has put billions of dollars into trying to make people feel happy all the time. We have this extravagant expectation that our lives should be filled with laughter and smiles 24/7, when in reality most of our lives are punctuated by long periods of boredom/unease. People who are happy are more malleable and better consumers. We really do live in a brave new world style hyper reality where people fear sadness as unnatural.

Most house rules, including those at the WSOP, requires that a player show all hole cards at showdown, regardless of which cards will be used to from the hand. The history of this likely comes from detecting cheats or invalid hands. 
Now imagine playing a game with multiple unknown players and the rules are set such that if all players act honestly, they all have an equal chance of winning. In addition, since the game recognizes that cheaters cannot be avoided, the rules ensure the chances of winning for cheaters are lower than honest players and punishment for cheating is high.

World War II, the GI Bill sent tens of thousands of working men into universities. the 1970s, the American educational system was increasingly open to women and/or Black and Latino Americans.

Stayed out there for about three hours just watching in awe. Having flown since I was a tiny child I often take how amazing the concept of flight is for granted, but watching those new two story superbus planes taking off is a true wonder.

Flatpak might be a better alternative (it allows multiple repositories), but it works by "bundling" dependencies (so generally speaking, an app will have to download and store dependencies it might never need), which increases download time, bandwidth demands, and needed disk space (and will have a higher environmental/carbon footprint ).

This was along the same lines as my thought process at the time. He has so few combos of value hands and since weren't not holding any spades it's plausible some random spewy flush draws could play it this way. The effective stack size is definitely one of the bigger factors at play here and I think to call it off we would need some type of history or read about the type of player V is.

I mean, as long as neither partner tries to pressure the other into being a different way, and as long as neither is judging the other, everything is cool. I also know a man that keeps it from his wife of many years. They seem very happy, but I can imagine hiding something like that from my spouse. Or even feeling the need to. I always wondered how she would feel if she found out after all those years of being lied to (because yes, lying by omission is still lying).

I don't have much actual useful advice for you, just wanted to offer a different perspective. I don't think your wife is necessarily being a terrible person or spouse, and neither are you. Eight months might sound like a long time, but having a baby is a life changing event and you're both still trying to figure out your new lives (especially her). This isn't the time to make demands, it's a time to communicate more. Your wife isn't trying to neglect you specifically, she's just consumed by the baby and very likely has lost some of her sense of self just as much as she's lost some of her connection to you. Don't just talk at her about your feelings, also make sure to find out how she's feeling. And don't just try to talk to her about your relationship, ask her about how she's doing in general. Sometimes it's useful to have information gathering conversations first, and then digest that, before moving on to problem solving conversations.

Yep I feel this a lot. I a female developer so I in a male dominated industry but even so I find it hard in comparison to my male colleagues because I constantly second guess myself, don have the confidence to stand up for my opinions etc. Now is this a female issue? It hard to tell but when I talk to other female devs at work they all say they felt the same. My boyfriend works for a different company in a similar role and said he never felt like that. I think when you the "other" in an industry (I imagine it works the same for men in female dominated industries) you feel like you pushing extra hard to not only represent yourself but your entire gender. If I make a stupid mistake that gets cast across "all female developers" and that makes me wary (let not mention things like men getting disciplined less harshly and being seen as confident go getting leaders in comparison to all the negative traits that get applied to women. "Bossy" being a feminine term).

Sadly, this is often the case. analyzing each real estate expert evidence in detail, Justice Mesbur determined that she was unable to accept either expert opinion, adding, with some frustration, I recognize the valuation is an art, not a science, I would have expected the ultimate opinions to have been much closer to one another. then went on to parse at length, the differences between each expert, increasing the $14,000,000 value for the Toronto home proffered by one expert and discounting the other expert value of $17,600,000. She determined that the home was valued at $15,500,000 at the date of separation.
