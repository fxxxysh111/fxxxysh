With the Team Bonder resting at home after a minor op to remove a tenner from his wallet, it was a very familiar Wanderers line up that took to the alley. A 51 start from Boldy's was quickly dealt with by a 71 hand (including a 15 spare from Skipper Hake) to go 20 up. A 16 spare from Mike 'Pot Hunter' Stabbins on the third hand and a 16 spare from Skipper Hake on the fourth helped to increase our lead to 38.

Nog een vignet kopen voor Slowakije, en daar was de grens dan eindelijk. Via kleinere wegen reden we de hoofdstad binnen. De communistische woonblokken vielen meteen op (typisch voor deze kant van Europa). Via de UFO brug over de Donau reden we Bratislava binnen, je passeert hier ook een stuk van de oude vestigingsmuren, en zo vonden al snel ons hotel Best Western Antares in een klein straatje heuvel op. We waren blij met onze comfortabele kamer, en trokken hierna meteen de stad in. Onderweg passeerden we nog het mooie kerkhof Kozia Brana dat dateert al uit de 18 de eeuw, met veel oude beelden en oude bomen. Ook zagen we al een heleboel heel mooi gedecoreerde huizen soms opgeknapt soms helemaal vervallen. Op wandel bergaf naar het centrum kwamen we een pizza restaurantje in een kelder tegen. Hier hebben we heel lekker gegeten en het was ook supergoedkoop onze eerste kennismaking met de lage prijzen hier! Bedoeling was ook nog even de oude stadskern in te trekken, maar het vroege opstaan eiste vooral bij mij zijn tol, en we gingen dan ook maar terug naar het hotel, op tijd gaan slapen.

This wasn the case with Trials since you could just reset a card if you lost progress.

After the blinds and antes (if applicable) are placed, each player is dealt two down cards (called hole cards). Then each player starting with the player to the left of the big blind has an opportunity to call (place an amount of money equal to the previous player's bet) the big blind, raise the bet (to place a bet higher than the previous player's), or fold (resign from the round of play). When the action (or betting) gets to the player in the small blind position, he/she can call the partial bet they initially placed, raise the bet, or fold. The player in the big blind has the option to raise or check (to decline to bet) if there are no raises as he/she already has a full bet in the pot. Any player who calls the big blind and has the pot raised behind him/her then has the option to call the raise or reraise the pot.

I don see Overwatch getting in real love in the future. That just my negative opinion from my own working experience. Companies like Activision don care about quality and long term products. They want to make money quickly, and lots of it. It a very near sided and foolish business approach, but it definitely a popular one. If Activision sees a decline in Overwatch income, they going to start pulling resources OUT of it, not putting more into it. No amount of outcry on Reddit or their own forums are going to change anything. It all about that bottom dollar.

I will first preface this with a warning. I don use recipes unless I am baking or doing something precise for the first time. I much prefer to learn techniques and apply knowledge and a sense of taste when doing things like seasoning. Part of that is because questions like "how much garlic" or "how long do I cook" depend on things like taste and ingredients. A particularly strong head of garlic would require less than something a little milder, and visual/taste/aroma/sound indicators of doneness provide a much more accurate and flavorful experience. This of course requires some familiarity with cooking.

Russia had been planning its ban for some time, with parliament passing legislation in 2006 that would restrict gambling to four remote areas as of July 1 this year. But Ukrainian lawmakers were slower off the mark and only sprang into action in May, after nine people were killed in a fire at a slot machine hall in Dnipropetrovsk in eastern Ukraine. After the fire brought national attention to an industry that was already widely frowned upon, lawmakers pounced. The legislation they passed places a temporary ban on gambling while plans are drawn up to restrict gambling to special zones, most likely in Crimea on Ukraine's southern Black Sea coast. (See pictures of Vladimir Putin's Patriotic Youth Camp.)
The Clinton email investigation had another good example. The guy in charge of the Wiener laptop tried to get his bosses to talk to Comey a few times in the month after he got the laptop.

My guess is your stuck in gold because your expecting to win through dumpstering your lane opponent and you've hit a brick wall of players who can match you at that. You don't seem to understand that not every matchup is about killing your opponent repeatedly. There are probably still many of those fundamental skills you can clean up like backing timings, wave management, and probably CSing given the advice you give. Macro descision making isn't probably all that relevant yet at gold elo id guess and most players know the basics: to control neutral objectives and push towers when there down or unattainable.
The difference is in assault with a weapon vs assault with a deadly weapon. For example my weak ass punches would be assault with a weapon. Mike Tyson punches would be assault with a deadly weapon.

That not the only circumstance where someone would be charged with ADW though. Whether or not someones fists could be considered deadly would be the debate between the plaintiff and defendant.

To determine if a tournament is worth playing, the quick back of the envelope calculation is  x 30% roi based on your stats divided by the average number of hours (which changes based on winrate and tournament structure).

By way of comparison, I imagine that $20/hour is doable at 1/2 with that rake structure.

Online gaming not only promised a wide selection of games, mirroring that of a typical land based casino, but it also brought with it, rewards. When inside a casino, players often had access to some type of rewards card that could be inserted into a slot machine or handed to a dealer during table game play, in order to rack up points for play, which could later be redeemed for cash and/or rewards. Therefore, it only made sense for online casinos to implement a similar system. Welcome bonuses, regular promotions, and rewards programs became easily accessible for online players.

There no reason to bet large on the flop in hand 1. I don really mind a cbet at all, as I expect many players will call twice with single clubs that they probably shouldn but by betting so big you just asking to only get called by Ax or a big club, which has a ton of equity against your hand. Bet half pot or even less on flop, possibly turn depending on how good it is, and hope to get called by trash. The river is a clear check/fold. Most live players aren going to bluff with a missed club or even value bet Ax here, so the fold is easy if they bet. Obviously against a shove  even with your exploitable sizing  we folding.

This bird view of the NYC/East Jersey area was found in a rare pamphlet produced by the old North River Bridge Company in 1937. The image which is widely expandable and found in a pamphlet for a project entitled Lindenthal Bridge and Terminals, Condensed Statement1 shows the city from a considerable height with a long and oblique view, hovering north of Hoboken on the Jersey side with a view extending to all of Staten Island, which covers a distance of about 18 miles. Heading east (left) in this southerly view we see most of Manhattan, then about all of Brooklyn, highlighting at Coney Island. It is a curious and delightful view.

By the time players have rolling modifiers they mostly have steady access to advantage, as well as higher level cards and a thin, mean attack deck. Monsters can gain any such advantages, and these combined points are why I argue that not gaining check marks has a smaller impact on overall balance..

The awesome thing about poker is that no matter how good or bad you are there are always levels you can play at. For example, people who are new at the game might want to play at a lower level like 1$/2$ (or 1 cent/2 cent if you playing online). The great thing about that is the people who play at the lower levels of the game are generally the less skilled players.

In truth, there is a dilemma as to who can lay claim for the birth of this card game. The French have it 'poque' which descended from the Germans' 'pochen' which means "to knock". However, it can be contested that it could have originated from the Persian game of 'as nas' that could have been taught to the French settlers by Persian sailors in New Orleans. However poker came about, everybody is playing it and loving the challenge. Poker rules therefore are extremely important since you might be betting your car keys already, for all you know. The poker rules guides the green horn on how to lose graciously the first few deals. Thus learning to play a good game of poker is expensive.

It's a scam. I've installed the product on my new Win 7 OS laptopand they said all my drivers are outdated. I updated my "outdated"drivers. After the update, my Win 7 dont even look like Win 7anymore. I tried system restore to make everything back in orderbut does not work. Uniblue Driverscanner 15 reported that 8 drivers were out of date,4 of them labelled as "ancient". BEFORE registering and paying forDriverscanner (thank god), I decided to take an hour and updateeach of the drivers myself, which isn't all that hard to do, justtakes a little time. It turned out that ALL 8 drivers were thelatest drivers! And one other thing that made me suspicious is that the programtried to alarm me by reporting that one of the drivers is 8 yearsold (oh my god, I was quivering in my boots, heh, heh). What itdoesn't tell you is how old the most recent updated driver is. Themost recent one could also be eight years old, just a few daysyounger. Fact is, some drivers need no updating.

She isn't solely defined by boxing, but it is a defining attribute of her. Most thought they knew her game plan when she departed from the sport, but what many were about to find out was the check raise move she was about to show. Flipping the script on promoters and those largely engrained in boxing's systematic approach to producing fight events, Christina has solidified her position on a fight card that is solely promoted by the automotive and motorsports industry   but that's because she's opened those doors..

I too have been to both and found the ladies only shower much more fun. Most of the guys just were not into being at a co ed shower. Mine will be ladies only. I also figured even if we did co ed, the guest list would just be too huge. Even with ladies only it is 30+ people long. My DH (dear husband) was thrilled he would not have to be at the shower. He would rather hang out with the guys else doing something more fun for him. I have heard of some people that the guys do a diaper poker party while the girls do the shower.

Times in a row, we had a wonderful season in CL. However we need to think about what hes doing now, yeah i would say he improved the second half in the sense that hes not afraid to cut Quaresma and Caner anymore, and it seems like our team is playing by passing and not crossing all the goddamn time, for that im grateful as well, but cmon, a lot of things he's doing are just unacceptable, how the hell can you blow a 3 0lead like that? After seeing Ersun Yanal make drastic changes to the XI at the beginning of the second half, he just watched the slaughter happen and didnt make ANY changes until it was too late, how can the team be so unmotivated that they suddenly started losing the ball all the time, not being able to put pressure on FB and just parking the bus (they didnt even do that properly).

I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. 
After one incident of her once again being selfish, I just blew up at her over text and basically said I was done. I just realized that she hasn't contributed to my life in a good way in the last few years, and I actually would have panic attacks leading up to her visit because I just knew something was going to happen to upset me over the trip.

Imagine the intellectual bankruptcy, try to fathom the moral depravity, of considering what Mohammad bin Salman and Jared Kushner are doing in Saudi Arabia and beyond an "Arab Spring!" Which one is more ignorant: that you have no blasted clue what the Arab Spring was, or your calling the treacherous atrocities of Mohammad bin Salman the Saudi version of Arab Spring? Countless books, piles of learned essays by Arab and non Arab scholars and critical thinkers have been produced about the minutest aspects of the Arab revolutions. In art, literature, poetry, and scholarship   in scholarly conferences, academic seminars, and learned volumes young and older scholars have done their best to figure out the significance of the Arab Spring and then in comes this propaganda officer and issues page after page of a nonsensical gibberish the likes of which scarce anyone can fathom even in the "post truth" age of "alternative facts"..

Each player starts with only two cards and the remaining cards are shared, therefore it is an excellent game for strategic thinkers. In Texas hold 'em, like all variants of poker, players compete for the money in the pot, contributed by the players themselves. Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand the player holds.

2010: Eventually, however, I started to figure out a few things. I made friends with some other poker players and actually began to discuss hands and read forums like 2+2. I discovered Holdem Manager and realized that I was just clicking buttons aimlessly. By 2010 I was making some reasonable money online. 1 2bb/100 playing 200nl rush on Full Tilt. However, rakeback was absolutely insane at this time. By putting in 100 200k hands a month, I was somehow getting something near $10k in rakeback. Blackcard gave somewhere around 40% rakeback and then there were rake races and affiliate bonuses that I also got. So even with being only a slightly winning player, simply by putting in the volume I could make decent money. I was in school at this time so couldn put in as much volume as I wanted, but I knew that if the poker landscape stayed the same, I could make a living out of it.

The reality is that I was sexually abused from a young age on, yes, an almost daily basis. After years of therapy and support by trusted loved ones I moved past most of it, but still struggle with some issues (eg, occasional PTSD dreams, and disassociation in the face of certain stimuli). It came up in conversation with her when she was telling me all about how people choose the lives they born into when they leave their old lives, unless they have unfinished business or people they have to stick around and help. She was specifically using this to justify not feeling bad about things like homeless mentally ill people (there was a homeless problem in her city), because the life they living is meant to teach their soul something for the next life. She also expressed that can have been that bad if I able to talk about it frankly without breaking down, which is a really toxic view to have about recovery   essentially that, if you able to communicate about it and it didn absolutely destroy you, you have no reason to talk about it.

Or will his gambler's instinct prevail and impel him to extend himself too far? If the latter were to happen, Stout might have no choice but to turn his eyes to heaven and plead   as the factory worker Everett had done years earlier   "Make me even and I'll never gamble again."
Publicity move mostly.We needed World War 1 and World War 2 to learn our lessons about nationalism, revanchism, and the horrors of war. Europeans would still be militaristic, warlike nationalists otherwise.We needed the 30 Years War to realize how fucking stupid it is butchering 20% of each other over fucking religious differences.We needed to experience communism to realize it doesn work.If Brexit is rescinded, there will always be a large contingent of the population in the UK (and elsewhere) who will eventually romanticize it, how glorious freedom and independence was stolen away by treacherous Jeurocrats in Brussels.And unlike communists or ultranationalists, this group will be large, because nobody will ever be able to point to the decisive failure of Brexit   like they can to the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany   as proof of the idiocy of their ideas.Brexit will become a myth, a lodestone for what was taken away by the conniving French and Germans, by the secret Jewish conspiracy to wipe Europeans off the map by taking away control over immigration, blah blah blah blah blah.Sprinkling some democracy on a fucked up country will never fix things magically.

Been to all kinds of competitions, from regular xc trails to DH. XC mostly is casual grade, anyone can compete and thats fine. DH on the other hand requires more skill,ballz and a decent bike.

Even if Khalifa is only making thousands from the app, she is doing far less work than she did in the porn industry. Actresses in that world typically make between $300 and $1,500 for a single man/woman scene, according to CNBC. Khalifa is easily making that much from her app and she's only working with herself.
Heck, if you got family money to live on and aren hurting anyone, I got no issue with you just coasting through life, I do the same.. 
The smallest game at the Wynn (which is 90% of poker in Macau) is 50/100 HKD or about 6/12 USD. If you beating 200nlz you be a winning player in most 50/100 HKD and 100/200 HKD lineups in Macau.. 
My SO is in his 40s and has only just resurfaced these memories during therapy for dealing with his nMom. It's heartbreaking to see him basically suffer PTSD. Please get yourself a good therapist (you may need to shop around to find one that suits you). 
I have no problem playing video games. Sometimes, I can't wait for the next time to play. I have no problem sitting around and being lazy and taking a nap. 
Video poker is another game that can give better payouts. However, not all video poker games are the same. Before starting to play video poker, look at the pay tables in front of the video poker game. Then compare the pay tables with other machines. If you have chosen a machine with a bad pay table, you are just financing the casino next casino.
As the River Boyne divides the dioceses of Armagh and Meath, Drogheda was founded as two separate towns, Drogheda in Meath (for which a charter was granted in 1194) and Drogheda in Oriel (or as County Louth was then known. In 1412 these two towns were united and Drogheda became a Corporate styled as County of the Town of Drogheda Drogheda continued as a County Borough until the setting up of County Councils, through the enactment of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which saw all of Drogheda, including a large area south of the Boyne, become part of an extended County Louth. 
I was expecting an abundance of mentally unstable fireworks at the Beto rally, but all you gave me was a sparkler. 
The card with the face down is kept private until the very last minute. Nobody knows the true value of the card except for the player himself. 
That is one of the most common scam formulas that you will find in the sports betting world.

I started Dragon Pearl by Yoon Ha Lee. I loved his Machineries of Empire series and was excited to see what was next. This is about a young girl in a futuristic empire who leaves home to search for her brother, a young recruit for the fleet who has gone a wall. Her whole family are fox spirits who have magic, choose their gender, and are mistrusted by everyone else. Although it seems like a very nice story that I'm sure I would have liked when I was young, the plotting and pacing are too middle grade for me to get into so I did not finish. I'm looking forward to Lee's next adult book whenever that is.
After all this messing about and not pulling his weight we start to escalate what we were doing to the documents, and it essentially became who can do the worst thing to it (by it I mean his slides). This starts off quite simple suck as changing words to swear words in the little amount of work he did, we then started adding pictures and gifs onto it, and start layering them. 
As cultural sociologist Jeffrey Alexander points out, if we do not publicly decide what is evil, then we can never know what is good. When evil occurs, like the Holocaust, Watergate, or now the sanctioned torture of prisoners, we must respond with a public examination of it.

He's not wrong for wanting a Christian lifestyle (although, as someone said earlier, he IS wrong for shaming you about it), and you're not wrong if you decide you don't want that it just means you may not be compatible.. 
I honestly wouldn have been surprised if she was 18, so imagine my surprise when she told me she was 28! I looked her up later on the Dream Heaven website and that lists her as 23, but she must be telling the truth because a woman wouldn lie about being older! Anyway, I give her a more generous score for 28 because she looked and felt so much younger. 7/10.
