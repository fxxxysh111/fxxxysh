BRs are pretty random by their nature and if I was playing in a lobby with people of the same skill level, the early game would come down to loot luck which sucks. What I would like to see instead is a solo game mode, so that I don't keep losing because my random teammates are trash.

Get off your high horse. The referee has handed you the tie and you have the audacity to complain. And talk about entitlement when you want credit from a stranger when the game has been gifted and hardly earned. You capitalized on three mistakes and did nothing else both games. You got extremely lucky and be happy to have made it through but don't ask me to give you any credit. The hypocrisy in your response is incredible.
I remember going to the bathroom just after and realising the pain of my loss whilst pissing, it hurt. I proceeded to run my remaining 100 up to 220, and gained an alcohol fuelled sense of confidence to sit down at the poker table..

Titles for news posts should ideally be as close to the title of the report as possible. At times it could be awkward to eat by yourself, and portions are sold in a way that the more people eating, the cheaper it becomes. 2 weeks is too long for Seoul unless you want to hit up every little place and like to shop a lot.

It one of the most breath taking place I been to in my life and their green tea ice cream is no joke. This is a galbi BBQ place that has been open since the 1950s (very old for Korean standards). It is a very unique place where you grill delicious beef ribs over an old barrel with charcoal. Get there 30 40min before they open, or you will have to wait for 1 3hours to get in. This is Korean Hanu beef (so it is a little fancy), but totally worth it for one meal here. They cook the marbled beef in a thick steel pot like pan, so the fat collects throughout the meal. Afterward, they make Doenjang juk in the leftover fat. This is Korea famous Chicken Ginseng soup. Go at an off time, or expect a long wait. The neighborhood where this is located is my favorite in Seoul. Plan a full day going to Gyungbokgung, then eating here, visiting cafes int eh neighborhood to relax, go to Tongin market for a snack, and finally, party all night at the food culture alleyway. I highly recommend staying in this area for a night or two.
I can see how some people get addicted though because when you come out the other side with a fat gain, it a bit of a rush.

Orthopedists are useless in spine and disk problems as they understand the bone aspects, but not the neurological complexities. A general doctor just doesn't have the expertise required to treat this. The reason you need to report it is that if you're having tingling/numbness in your fingers (especially if it's creeping its way from the tips to the knuckles) the disk inflammation isn't getting any better and the pressure is enough that it's starting to cut off the nerve impulses to your hand.

I deliver for Frito Lay and would argue this isn the best advice. At the factory the chips are intentionally stacked in boxes upside down to prevent the seasoning from gathering at the bottom. Also when our trucks are loaded at the warehouse the dock workers load the boxes upside down for the same reason. It not until the chips are delivered to the grocery store that they are permanently in an upright position. Keeping the product upside down until it gets to the retailer has been standard practice at Frito Lay at least since I started working there back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer table.

I even more skeptical about a "cure" for autism. I have autism, and anyone who says it about inflammation has one big question yet to be answered to my satisfaction: how the heck does inflammation make a person logical and literal minded, unaware of the body language of others, more intuitive with computers, and obsessed with superheroes or Pokemon? And how can taking immune supplements rewire a miswired brain?
But it's really not funny. Not for Cashman, who is the one who ultimately signed Ellsbury to the seven year, $153 million millstone of a contract back in 2013, not long after allowing Robinson Cano to bail for Seattle. Cashman would never cop to this, of course, but having this signing on his watch has to be an enormous invisible elephant crowding him at his desk every time he ponders another free agent deal to the end of time   and who could blame him?.

Eventually it came down to me and him and at this point in the game, I had become very, very careful as to which hands I would commit to seeing a flop for. Slowly but surely I would make a comeback from being down to $2.00 of chips compared to his $24.00. Henry would win a few hands but I made sure to only call him if I actually had something good. If it was a bottom pair, I fold without a second thought. My luck would come through when I had worked my way up to about $4.50 and went All in with a set of Jacks. Winning that pot gave me more freedom to bluff and win chips that way.

This way then if one police station needed to communication the description of a suspect to another jurisdiction 100 miles away they would simply use a series of numbers. Each police station would own identical sets of these cards, so that all the receiving station would need to do would be to select the descriptive cards at their end and start placing them in order on their three head outlines and after a short interval a picture of the suspect would appear.

Little Nightmares echoes the most unsettling elements of Silent Hill, from unexplained wrappings of meat and unspeakably ugly, yet somehow human horrors, to simple items (in this case, shoes) with ominous power.

I absolutely agree, 100%. When I was growing up my dad had a friend I called "Auntie David." Auntie David, like my dad, was gay and I knew that but I also knew that he was a drag queen and would sometimes come over wearing makeup and wigs. He bring his box of jewelry, makeup, and feather boas and we play dress up together. That was my first introduction to drag culture. It was normal for me. I a bit older than a lot of the people on Reddit so I still remember seeing RuPaul music videos in the early 90s when I was in elementary school and my dad watched The RuPaul show BUT I was only allowed to watch the introduction and then I had to go to bed. As I got older I was introduced to more drag culture through movies and television (one of the ways I knew my husband was "the one" was when I popped our VHS copy of Priscilla while we were still in high school and he wasn like "oh this is weird.") I have a two year old now and we take her to the children festitivites during pride (they do drag queen story time, "love bubbles" where they have someone come in and blow huge bubbles, that sort of thing) but I don watch Drag Race or queens youtube channels around her because it not really appropriate content for children. I think there also something to be said for people who take their children to drag events but don really do much to support LBGTQIA individuals. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth because they taking from a community for their personal entertainment/gain but not actually doing much to support that community itself buuut that a different soapbox entirely.

They ended up going third and fourth overall in the NHL draft that summer. This time, the leaders already are property of big league clubs. Sault Ste.

Both clubs have the ability to put up 10 goals at any time against weak defensive play.

You have enough room to create a notch and many commercial brakes have 2 notches cut out for that reason, and also perhaps so you can adjust what direction you want the compensation to go. The AKM muzzle brake is intentionally offset to account for the imbalance of the bolt carrier, and with the AKS 74 being even lighter it might make sense to just run it in the current notch.

Further, people who view more sex films actually hold more egalitarian beliefs, not less," she explains. "Finally, sex films are overwhelmingly positive for women, who report greater desire for their current sexual partner, a wider breadth of sexual behaviors that they enjoy, more sex positive attitudes, and more accurate knowledge of genital anatomy."

Wageningen was a small university town in the war (look up the WUR, it the descendant of the old agricultural university). This meant that the town housed a lot of students (mostly men at the time), and at some point during the war some of the students learned that the Germans were gong to call on all able male students who had until then been exempt from work detail to be rounded up for the arbeitseinsatz. One or more of them broke into the city hall at night and stole the municipal register that contained a list of everyone studying and working in Wageningen at that time, the only complete register that existed. The ledgers were hidden in the chicken coop of a large farmhouse which still exists today. Over the next week the Germans arrested several suspects and eventually executed two students; but the register wasn recovered until after the war and to my knowledge it is not known who actually stole it and whether they were among those arrested. The missing register meant that a lot of men escaped being deported to Germany to work in the war industry, and could stay on as students under various guises such as being local farm hands without the Germans being any wiser.

I disagree. I agree with the other comment reply actually. Also, if you look at the details, it the worst in 1st and 2nd year white medical students, students who haven actually worked with people yet. It states that 4th years were much more accurate in their diagnosis of pain and that they had less bias. In the next sentence it says that actual doctors, not students, do not have racial bias when measured. That the vast majority of doctors, plus they argue that no minorities were biased for or against blacks. I fail to see how that would definitely lead to an only white opioid epidemic. (I not an expert, just read the article, if you want to discuss I happy to)There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking your doctor and getting an explanation and reassurance from him! Most doctors like to see their patients engaged with their medical care. That being said, there actually some really interesting research being conducted right now into using ultrasounds in the brain to treat some diseases. I not an expert, but I don know of any serious neurological dangers to having an ultrasound near your brain. Again, your doctor would know more about this specific procedure and the research or risks behind it than anyone on the internet would.

Know how to play a basic game. Video poker is simple and similar to regular poker in that you are aiming for a hand that will give you the most return. To play video poker you will tap on the cards you wish to keep or on a button on the console, and then draw cards you wish to replace. 
Simmer on a medium high heat for about 20 minutes or so. The tomatoes flavor should still be present in the final sauce. Marinara is meant to have a "fresh" tomato flavor as opposed to a thick, rich "long" sauce. Tomatoes naturally have an acidic component to them as well as natural sweetness. This is what makes them so good and versatile. We would hate to destroy this balance by adding sugar just as much as we would hate to mask the underlying sweetness of the tomato by adding an acidic component such as vinegar.

In other words, heteronormative desire is the cultural script that commercial porn gives us over and over again. And eventually it sinks in: this is what sex looks like, this is how desire works. It like advertising that way: this is what is fashionable and beautiful, this is what is ugly. The more you consume, the straighter you get. And that how porn turned me straight. I watched too much, fantasized myself into it once too often and poof, all desires outside of the heterosexual matrix disappeared.

Believe it or not, this actually happened to the Trachte brothers, whose porn search was pure conjecture on our part, but the results were real enough. The pair discovered, among several other valuable works, a famous Norman Rockwell painting hidden behind a false wall in their deceased father's Sandgate, Vermont, home. The painting, entitled "Breaking Home Ties," netted $15.4 million at Sotheby's Auction House. Don Trachte Jr., the father of the brothers who found the painting, had made a copy of the piece to prevent his wife from taking possession of it in their divorce. He managed to hold on to the painting through the split, but for some reason went on displaying the fake. Even on his deathbed, Don never told anyone about the forgery, or the real multimillion dollar piece of artwork rotting in the walls. Presumably because he enjoyed picturing their faces if someday somebody accidentally knocked their head through the drywall and found $15 million sitting there.

This is exactly what my mother did to me when I was younger. I was a good kid, didn get into any major trouble, etc but she got angry at me(like screaming, shouting, making me cry type rage) for a lot of stupid reasons. After the first time she would do that to me, we would be sitting in silence for 10 minutes or so, then she would tell me that I can go. Then, as soon as I got up to go, she would yell at me for getting up. I honestly have no idea why she would do that. Although my dad is more chill, he would also did this sometimes too. Is this something all parents do?

In the popular conception, Greece and Rome are treated as these monoliths, yet their civilizations spanned many centuries (millennia depending on whether you count the fall of the Western or Eastern Empire as the end date), and changed and developed dramatically within that period. Greece comprised many city states, which while sharing some cultural elements, had vastly different forms of government and priorities. Rome went from a kingdom to a republic to a empire, and even within these periods underwent vigorous debate and reforms..

"UKE" KANCER, Jerry November 17,1949   April 15, 2017 Proudly born in Val d'Or Quebec, Jerry had a love of streaking, karaoke, Neil Diamond, the Red Sox and most of all, making people laugh. Son of Walter and Alla, dad and best friend to Jesse. Grandpa to Austin and Sierra (his bumblebees). Jerry loved to travel, make new friends and "yuk it up". He spent many years at Canpar, "drinking the Woodies and delivering the goodies" and once he retired, started taking frequent walks from the couch to the fridge between innings and periods. His house was always open to his friends and you could always find people on Woodworth Drive bonding over losing proline tickets, beers, music, and poker. Always quick to share his dislike of the Blue Jays and Maple Leafs and full of "one liners", Jerry was happiest among his many friends.

Injury and InfectionWorking as a massage therapist is extremely physically demanding. Massage therapists are typically on their feet for most of their working days and regularly carry out motions that can lead to repetitive strain injuries and fatigue. Standing for long periods of time can damage joints, make muscles ache and cause foot problems, according to "Hazards Magazine." Repetitive strain injuries can make it painful to move muscles and joints, which could cost a massage therapist his livelihood if a problem were to become persistent or chronic. The fact that massage therapists work at such close quarters to their clients also means they could be at an increased risk of contracting contagious infections.
