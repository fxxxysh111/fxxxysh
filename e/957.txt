 2 points  submitted 23 hours agoYou not thinking enough about the big enough picture. Sure it sounds ridiculous to say that a spot at one point decides he done with poker because his last few tables weren talkative enough, but there truth to it.Think of it, some regfish is on a losing streak in his poker room, and constantly all of his competition is stoic and refuses to go out of their way to socialize in the slightest even when they the ones being directly engaged. What the fuck is he still playing for? He losing, he not having fun, and the people he losing to seem miserable and make the atmosphere miserable too.Now what if he still had the same losing streak, but every session the atmosphere was lighter? When he tries to talk to someone they talk back, he been able to shoot the shit about sports or TV or crazy gambling stories with some of the other regs, and when he butchers hands for stacks someone would reinforce him just by saying something really innocuous under their breath like "that so sick" as if it was some standard cooler.In which situation do you think the spot is more likely to keep playing?Also keep in mind that OP and I aren asking every reg to try to be the life of the party, but just to go out of their comfort zone a little bit to not be a noticeable detriment to the environment.

Throughout Europe, Arabia, and India, incense proved to be immensely versatile; it was used as perfume, medicine, and even mouthwash. Remember, early incense contained nothing other than ground herbs, plant gums, and honey. (Only much later was messy charcoal and inedible saltpeter added so that, once ignited, it would continue burning.) Since most of the herbs were highly antiseptic, when rubbed on the skin and melted by body heat, they released a scent and disinfected wounds. Incense was even ingested as medicine. It is no surprise, then, that the Greek word aromata had several meanings: incense, perfume, spice, and aromatic medicine. The Chinese also had one word, heang, to describe perfume, incense, and the concept of fragrance.

The first second message you posted is cringe inducing. Correcting cycler, "do you at least have a favorite dish", etc. I don know if you read some book on negging or something but regardless that not the way to talk to people. I have said fuck you too. Scrolling through the rest   "you like garlic, i like garlic, like me please" is not compelling or going to start any conversations. Just in general   obviously talking to people on OKC is weird and it hard to have an honest connection when you just reading a profile, but I say keep it simpler, don write long messages with a lot of questions/topics, and stay positive (both about yourself and her). Connect on what genuine and take the rest offline so you can have a real conversation. If she messaging you back with anything but a super short response, she almost definitely interested anyway.

Sensorimotor Stage and Schemas The first stage described by Piaget is the sensorimotor stage, occurring during the first two years of life. At this stage Children, "think," with their senses developing consistent schemas about the world and expectations about how their interaction with it will alter it. A child's understanding about the world is being formed as they experiment upon it by touching, tasting, seeing, and hearing what surrounds them. The development of these schemas he called, "adaptation."

Some would argue that the traits are more prevalent in different genders as the result of social constructs that shouldn exist and using terminology that refers to the gender stereotypes further reinforces these social constructs, preventing societal development and gender equality. For example if you believe that Mathematical ability is more prevalent in males and Art ability is more prevalent in girls then you might refer to some subjects as "Boy subjects" and others as "Girl subjects". If 0.01% of people have the capacity to be amazing at maths but 5 times more males take maths then you end up with 5 times more male maths geniuses   this can perpetuate the mindset that "men are better at maths" and the shameful lack of women in STEM degrees doesn improve..

Good cocktail service and friendly dealers, normally was at least two tables going during the day, definitely the softest games around without a notable absence of pros/crushers, I think this is because they don do promos. They do, however, give you a free buffet when you play for fours hours or more which was awesome and I took advantage of a lot of times before eating and going elsewhere.

His "Eugene" character, meanwhile, transcended language through his silence and sight gags. Kovacs combined the best of the silent era and early radio for Eugene, who never spoke.

Trying to eat lunch quietly, Kovacs as Eugene watches in wonder as his olives and oranges roll off the seemingly straight table to the sound of loud drum rolls   there's even a version in color on the box set. Both examples are achievements made even more remarkable by the primitive technical conditions and notoriously low budgets Kovacs and his team navigated.

If possible, bet more when he's watching. While the card is tracking a gambler's actual play, the pit boss is taking in a lot of information, too, such as how long a particular player remains at the table. He'll often approach high rollers with offers to make their stays more comfortable. Other players will probably have to ask for comps with no guarantee of an affirmative response. They can also go over the pit boss's head to the casino host, but this approach is usually best suited to heavy gamblers who have never visited this particular casino before.

This means it doesn necessarily have a total order, but there is a "valuation" (the complex modulus) which follows specific rules with multiplication, which allow us to follow a division algorithm much like the division algorithm in Z. Euclidean domains are always UFDs, and so this is a "fast" way to justify that Z and Z[i] have unique prime factorization..

In this way, biofeedback can help individuals whose sleep problems stem from poor stress management, anxiety, or obsessive thoughts..

There are a couple of units that are better in every stat than another (F!Takumi vs Clarisse or Mia vs Athena), but its a really small amount that ends up being insignificant.Newer units tend to have a higher stat total, but the distribution of stats matter so old units might be better with some builds because of how their stats are distributed.Every update some old units get a new, unique weapon and/or a refine which gives them a new effect. This helps them have their niche.They recently added the dragonflowers which you can use to improve a unit stats (maximum of +1 to each stat, or +2 if they infantry units released before the mechanic was implemented). Of course since you can also give them to newer units this doesn help bridge the gap, but can help you make a unit you like a little better.For PvE content (which is the majority of the game), it doesn really matter any way.

For a subject as raw as Mapplethorpe, the movie gives off a vibe that's a bit too sanitized, too safe. All biopics can be this way, but you do have to wonder, given Timoner's documentarian background, why she opted for a narrative feature.

I know next to nothing about North Korea other then articles I read which never paint a pretty picture. I have wondered for a long time why they wouldn pursue a course like this because in the end it would so greatly benefit the people and the country as a whole. I know there must be other factors but it always come back to why wouldn you want to bring yourself into the fold and reap the benefits of a peaceful reconciliation. I sure that naive of me to think for many reasons but if anyone can break it down for me itd be interesting to read. To be honest I can even say I fully understand the Korean War at all, public school failed me and I just never taken the time to research on my own. These new developments make me feel hopeful and really seem like the best and obvious answer for North Korea especially now. I guess I just don really understand why North Koreans chosen to remain separated for so long. Is it fear of a take over or an over throw of their government or culture? They have guns we have to have guns? I wouldn even know where to began researching or looking for information to be honest so if anyone has some input to push me in the right direction I be really interested

In terms of deception, which involved everything from attaching the 19th Division that belonged to 4 Corps to 33 Corps to hide the 4 Corps, to fake radio traffic and superiority in the air to prevent Japanese reconnaissance planes from seeing them, it was truly an imaginative strategy that truly has been overlooked. Lastly, and this is always important when talking about military campaigns, Slim could count on the great logistic abilities of his quartermasters and engineers who were able to build airfields on the move so as to supply these two large corps while they marched towards the Irrawaddy. The corps were predominantly supplied either from the air or from the rivers, with improvised rafts and repaired boats serving as vessels to carry supplies..

Reports coming in from our highway forecasters traveling on roadways early this morning or doing mitigation work have stated: "there isn a piece of avalanche terrain that hasn slid." This is incredible, but shocking news given the impressive avalanche cycle over the past few days. This second round of heavy snowfall has put storm totals for March into historic levels. Combine these amounts with strong winds and we have some of the most dangerous avalanche conditions in years. Crews are out to keep the major roadways open, but further travel in or around avalanche terrain is not recommended. Even at lower elevations, a high rain line has increased the risk of wet avalanches. Under these exceptional conditions, expect all avalanche paths, both small and large to slide.

The existence of such a Behavior is something which is consistent with Reflex semantics, but which it also gives you no tools to define at the moment.In the earlier FRP systems that Ryan and I worked on which did have such a behaviour, it would destroy performance anywhere that you actually used it, because a behaviour that is guaranteed to have a different value every time it is observed has a tendency to invalidate all the caches it comes into contact with.

One of the good things about massage, of course, is that you don't have to visit a professional to capture its benefits. You can ask your partner, friend, or family member for a soothing rubdown. You can also give yourself a mini massage, focusing on the muscle groups that are within reach. Using small, circular movements with your fingers and hands, you can massage your scalp, forehead, face, neck and upper shoulders, lower back, arms, legs, and feet. There are also a variety of massaging devices available in various price ranges that can help extend your reach or provide soothing heat as well as relaxing vibrations.

The reason is because whenever you dissolve sugar into water, each molecule is broken apart and it becomes a solution with water. However, water can only hold so much sugar in it at a certain temperature, so if you put then maximum amount of sugar that can dissolve in water at a temperature (called a saturated solution) and then cool it down, you may start to see some sugar crystals form. This is actually how rock candy is formed because you put in excess sugar and then cool down the solution and the sugar crystals form into the stick for the rock candy.. 
The reason for the paradoxical results was straightforward enough: the majority of the wins the players tallied were for relatively small stakes.

Because you would be the one who would need to raise that kid to be a hopeful person and to get them to believe in the goodness of being alive. You know?
