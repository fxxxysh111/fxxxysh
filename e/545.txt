I believe in the long run, turkey will almost surely find itself in a recession since we trapped ourselves in stagflation (high interest rates, high inflation and high unemployment for non econ grads). turkeys financial economy is still somewhat strong but its real economy is fucked up and will only get worse it seems. if we get out of this one without a formal crisis or recession i would be shocked and it would be an economic miracle honestly.Varaquli  5 points  submitted 7 months agoAlthough they do suck when you collectively compare all the programmes, they are actually the leading uni pushing for game design and development in Turkey.

Akatsuki   A little Mika with Atra hair, so cuuuute. I love his name. Being that Mikazuki (Mikadzuki/ ) is the crescent moon, his name symbolized that he was missing something, if not empty as we saw him. Akatsuki (), on the other hand, means "dawn," but taken more literally it's a red or "Blood Moon". So Akatsuki is the first light after the darkness of everything that took place during the series, and he also the full moon; made complete by the things Tekkadan sacrificed in order to eventually allow him to exist and carrying on Mika's legacy.

I really loved the bass line   I was chasing a bass line and I had a really cool one in '1973.' And I pursue that again with 'Dangerous' and 'Superstar' and 'These Are the Words' and 'Turn Me On.'

As I said before, I believe that a recount should be performed after each election, not just this one. If they occur regularly, I don think they would cause more doubt in the election results. In fact, I think they would only strengthen the results and work to remove any doubt. However, I acknowledge that it would require a significant effort to perform a recount, and that the vast majority of the time the results would not be changed, only solidified. I believe that this is important, but I also understand that some people would disagree. Thank you for the civil discussion and new perspective, and have a good weekend.
Now you have to put it all together, breathing out normally through your mouth, then just before the air runs out, storing some in your cheeks.

Instead of making a big raise, say $50,000 from the button, I folded my hand.

Game 4 gets rained out so I end up going to school on the date on our tickets because everything will be pushed back a day because of the rainout. Turns out some combo of MLB and the Cardinals org decided it makes more sense to inconvenience 45k people by 2 days than 90k people by one day; so people with game 5 tickets go on the day they were scheduled to what became game 4, and people with game 4 tickets go 2 days later than schedule to what became game 5, the clinching game.

Note that any small business involves some amount of risk that the business could fail and the owner could go broke. So while risking a large bankroll as a professional poker player might not be like going to a 9 to 5 job and getting a paycheck every week, it is a lot like opening a restaurant and hoping that it won't be one of the 60% that fail. And it's actually less risky in some ways, because it's relatively easy for a small business to operate on credit, whereas poker players usually use their own money for their bankroll, so poker players can at least just walk away and not worry about direct effects on their debt or credit rating.

I rather like this slight, self published book; slight because at only 41 multi coloured pages   some with no text on them   it's very easy to read at one sitting, especially as much of it is in anapestic rhyming and alliterative tri lines, rather like a looooong nursery rhyme. 
As Benjamin Disraeli pointed out long ago,There are lies, damn lies and then there are statistics."The problems with statistics are many. The results are in what we ask, how we ask it, whom we ask, and most importantly, how we interpret it. If we ask voters "Do you think Obama should be doing more to cooperate with Republicans in Congress" they will often say "yes" and then we interpret that as the cause for the loss of popularity among the Dems.But if we asked voters "Do you think Obama policies are significantly different than Bush and people said "no" then we could use that to explain the drop in the Dems popularity.The truth is, if the new administration and the Democratic controlled Congress do not take this moment to create a radical break with the former administration  end the wars, stop giving wealth to the banks rather than the people, hold the Bushies accountable, etc.

When we were kids we pretty much forced her to cuddle and eventually she just gave in. I think part of it is that as kids getting these cats was a huge deal and once we got them we were so excited we couldn leave them alone. Now she is such a sweet girl who let us carry her everywhere and sleeps up on our chests every night. When we get home she runs to the door and meows and us until we pick her up, she gets genuinely stressed out when we aren there she just always wants to be around us.

Researchers state that, "Dysfunction of NMDA receptors seems to play a crucial role in the neurobiology of disorders such asParkinson disease,Alzheimer disease,epilepsy, ischemic stroke, anxiety and depression," such that, "ligands interacting with different sites of NMDA receptor complex are widely investigated as potential agents for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders" (22). In fact, drug inhibitors at the NMDA receptor complex, such as ketamine, demonstrate antidepressant effects (23, 24), but also induce such severe side effects that their clinical utility is limited (31). Magnesium, on the other hand, may have a similar mechanism of action by interfering with NMDA receptor activation without the adverse consequences of drug induced NMDA receptor blockade (25).

Because the Aces are of course higher then the Kings, the hand AA22X (or Aces and Deuces) win the hand. (Full Answer)

One of the primary benefits of a sports massage is that it boosts blood circulation in areas near the skin that may not get as much circulation normally. Working a muscle will momentarily push blood out of an area, and then allow blood to rush back in with fresh nutrients like oxygen. You can see this process at work: When you put pressure on skin, it pales as blood rushes out, while releasing pressure makes it redden as blood rushes back. When done well, this massaging process will also help your body pump blood to the heart, while pushing metabolic wastes (like lactic acid) out of your system. One sports massage technique involves stroking in the direction of the heart on limbs to best assist circulation.

First, he guided us toward the classic Crepe Monsieur, telling us we couldn't possibly go wrong with the French ham and gruyere cheese favorite. Then, with a dramatic pause accompanied by a look of apprehension and a caress of his imaginary chin beard, he pointed instead to the Florentine Chicken Crepe, suggesting it would be an absolute shame to miss the chef's delectable cream sauce.Though he had our mouths watering in anticipation, he switched gears again and spent the next minute waffling between the Florentine and the Neo Seoul, an eclectic crepe package filled with shredded barbeque pork and kimchi.It's clear that A Cafe is trying to put a fresh spin on an old menu favorite.

One thing that become more apparent as software like snowie and solvers take over is that when there still a lot of cards to come (aka preflop) is that the line between "bluffs" and "value" gets very blurred. Snowie doesn 3 bet hands that work better as a call, or are  ev to 3 bet. Except in river spots, an optimal strategy will rarely be having dichotomies of bluffs and value that pseudo GTO strats of 2013 used to think were good.
