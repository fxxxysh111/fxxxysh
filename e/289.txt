I say let start by updating our definitions for what you can label "news." Fox News is just state run political propaganda. Just nothing but a spin machine for a particular ruling party. How many outright lies and deceits need to be proven before they can no longer have "NEWS" in big letters plastered all over their network? They have a right to exist, sure, but they are nothing but pure spin and should be treated with the same journalistic respect as say, a high school newspaper or the comments section of a youtube video. Alex Jones has a right to free speech but he also does not have the same protections as legitimate news organizations.

Plumber here, I started my apprenticeship at 29, there is a growing and severe lack of skilled labor in this country and once you have the skills and can show that you a good employee companies will fall over each other trying to hire you, all that to say 26 is not too old at all and as a matter of fact my company doesn like taking on apprentices that are just out of high school/ don have much general work experience because they pour a LOT of money and resources into training you and want to see that you a good employee (through work history) before they make that investment. BTW I LOVE what I do and would recommend plumbing to anyone who interested. Plumbing is a much more cerebral trade than people think (I a service plumber vs. new construction) because when you diagnosing a problem you get to play detective "what is the customer saying, what am I seeing, how was this plumbed (often what you trying to diagnose you can directly see)" on the tough diagnosis jobs customers think you have magic powers when you crack it and explain what happened and why and what the fix is.

I will first preface this with a warning. I don use recipes unless I am baking or doing something precise for the first time. I much prefer to learn techniques and apply knowledge and a sense of taste when doing things like seasoning. Part of that is because questions like "how much garlic" or "how long do I cook" depend on things like taste and ingredients. A particularly strong head of garlic would require less than something a little milder, and visual/taste/aroma/sound indicators of doneness provide a much more accurate and flavorful experience. This of course requires some familiarity with cooking.

By the first method, the first card can be whatever we want, so the probability is 52 / 52. The second card is more restrictive, however. It must correspond to the suit of the previous card. There are 51 cards left, 12 of which are favourable, so the probability that we'll get two cards of the same suit is (52 / 52)  (12 / 51) = 4 / 17.

"Every home has its own signature scent," Brashear says, noting that air is a complex combination of all odor molecules, like laundry and hair care products, lotion, cooking smells, or pet odors, stinky shoes and other undesirable scents. She says that the odor cycle affects every home, since there's usually nowhere for those scent molecules to go, especially when the house is closed up during the cold and hot weather months. So, when scent molecules get released into the air they move throughout the home, then they settle into the couch, carpet, drapes, etc. "Then, as soon as somebody plops down on the couch or there's a spike in humidity those molecules get re released into the air," she says. And while many of us make it a priority to regularly clean closets, baseboards and bathrooms, she recommends truly cleaning the air with products that trap odor molecules and eliminate them rather than simply masking them. "Air makes up more than 75 percent of the space in your home and it's really important and often neglected."
This, according to Maurice Blackburn, encourages the perception that gamblers have had "near misses" when they lose.

Just meet and get married to a South Korean citizen. That more realistic and doable than going to a university in America for 4+ years plus masters, to get an English teacher position just so that you can live here.

In October 2016, the SPLC published a list of "anti Muslim extremists", including British activist Maajid Nawaz and ex Muslim activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The SPLC said that Nawaz appeared to be "more interested in self promotion and money than in any particular ideological dispute," identified what it said were gaps and inconsistencies in his backstory, and rebuked his claim that British universities had been infiltrated by radical Islamists.[103] Nawaz, who identifies as a "liberal, reform Muslim", denounced the listing as a "smear", saying that the SPLC listing had made him a target of jihadists. Mark Potok of the SPLC responded "Our point is not to make these people targets for violence.

And why do you associate me with other criminal acts? I have never robbed, killed, broken in to, or defaced. My only crime is drug use that stems from growing up in a community where cocaine was easy to get. I've worked every day since I turned 18 to pay my way, and to pay my taxes.

Thomson managed to put an understandable assessment on a very difficult visualization, talking in terms of an atom being "1/10,000,000 or from 1/10,000,000 to 1/100,000,000 of a centimetre in diameter", or 1x10 7meters, which is just about the size of a cell nucleus or DNA; that in the neighborhood, especially if you look at the smaller number which is 10 8 meters, which starts to close in on the size of the massive carbon atom (10 10), but sorta not so close to the electron (10 12) , or carbon atom nucleus (10 14) or proton (10 15).

I live in a corner unit with super thin walls. Neighbor on one side is an obese dude who works nights, but apparently forgets that fact every night as about the time I going to bed I hear the loud thunk of his recliner being put down and him stomping around his apartment for two minutes before he slams his door on the way out. The lady on the other side of me cackles instead of laughs and recently got a new sound system that faces our shared wall. 
FYI the term "net neutrality" started as boiler plate contract language between two ISP or whatever autonomous Internet system (AS). There was a "net neutrality" clause in the contracts, that is where this all started. and it like many other words that have taken on more baggage and meaning over time significantly different than how started. So we are talking about contracts laws here, but it become a big consumer protection blanket term for any and almost every issue across the board. an ISP throttling a customer is substantially different than the peering and transit services they provide to internet back haul providers. So I like how you listed common carrier, but that is one of the topics not related to net neutrality (as a contract language goes).
They make the usual mistakes with me changing names and that fine   none of it is intentional I joke that I should have changed my name to can really say I had any problems administration wise and the only transition related work issue I have had was of my own doing when I came off hormones and within a month was in hideous depression and had to take time off work.

It will likely be back up as soon their next big $$ guarantee tourney has to be "cancelled due to ddos attacks". This is a damn shame and a prime example of why online poker needs to be made legal again and 100% regulated. The Government itself should run the game and rake in that big time $$$. Imagine online poker legal in the entire US, no issues at all for banking and withdrawing your money and finally having a platform to play a game with high integrity aka no downright cheating, a high quality software program and the best team of defense techs. If the government legalized and regulated online poker again we could see so much good done for the country.

31 years after this came the "God" change, which Bellamy certainly would have objected to:
All the nuclear processes from which energy can be obtained involve the rearrangement of protons and neutrons in nuclei, the protons and neutrons themselves remaining intact. Hundreds of experimental investigations through the last 30 years have taught us how much energy can be liberated in each transformation, whither by the fission of heavy nuclei or the fusion of light ones.

In their old jobs they variously had status, power or money. Now they are starting again at the bottom, training to be teachers in what are politely known as London secondary schools. I worried about my own transformation from pampered columnist to maths teacher how will I remember 200 names when I can remember my own children but also worried about the other 45 trainees. As this whole mad caper was my idea, I feel responsible for everyone else. Most of all, I am anxious that this experiment works so that more people like us will do it too.

I worked near Myeongdong for a couple years, and still go there once in a while. It makes for a good stop on a bigger all day out itinerary, as it is located next to all the tourist attractions in Jongro, pressed up next to Subway Line 2, and not too far from Itaewon either. The tourist traffic is unavoidable, and there are a lot of chains stores. However, I do enjoy grabbing a bite to eat there. These are the places I would go:

La polmique est lance suite  la diffusion d'une vido lors d'un dbat  Angers en 2006 o Mme Sgolne ROYAL fait une proposition: au lieu des 17 heures obligatoires de prsence des professeurs  l'cole, passer aux 35 heures de prsence dans l'tablissement: "je pense qu'une des rvolutions c'est de faire les 35 h au collge c'est  dire que les enseignants restent 35 h au collge" incluant les cours et un soutien individualis gratuit.

I believe what u/illumynite is referring to is the practice of so called "sovereign citizens" in the US to claim when pulled over by a cop that they are not "driving" but they are "traveling".

The tensions that the police ops in Lyari are instigating are dangerous and widespread. They go far beyond the problems of urban decay, or ethnic ghettoisation in Karachi.

We started off with the basic shower, where the girl cleans you from head to toe and then sends you to the bed. She then gave me a skillful if not strong Nuru massage. I don much like oil massage but Nuru is water soluble, odourless and naturally dissolves on its own, so you get the nice slip slide massage without ending up sticky, and when the gel wears off you can feel natural, bare skin. She worked over my legs, butt, back and arms for about 15 20 minutes before rubbing me over with her breasts. Yes, they were small, so I didn feel much softness, but I knew the massage was starting to turn erotic, and she already heated me up long ago and I was raring to get at her! Then she turned me over and massaged my front half for about 5 minutes before things got sexy again. After the sex, we had a long talk with a romantic atmosphere, and then a quick shower before saying our goodbyes.8/10

My husband and I have been practicing tantric sex for years. That's not as weird as it might sound. Basically, for us, it's just connective sex, sensual, being present, setting the environment with candles and music. It's not every time of course, but it's a foundation and it helps me stay in touch with my sexuality. Having had that before being a mom definitely helped, although I know it would be easy to let these things go if they're not a priority. I make them a priority. I don't know about Stella but Lucy definitely got her groove back. I kind of love the maternal aspect to my sensuality that's come from being a mom.

The term "new fangled treasons" comes directly from Blackstone (Commentaries, Book IV, Ch. VI, Line 87). Describing the development of English statutory and common law, Blackstone emphasized the problem of constructive treasons, explaining how 25 Edward III was enacted to restrict constructive, or judge made treasons, and how the statute must therefore be "our text and guide". Prior to 25 Edward III, Blackstone writes, "there was a great latitude left in the breast of judges, to determine what was treason, or not so; whereby the creatures of tyrannical princes had opportunity to create abundance of constructive treasons, offenses into the crime and punishment of treason, which never were suspected to be such". Blackstone argues that, "as this is the highest civil crime, which (considered as a member of the community) any man can possibly commit, it ought therefore to be the most precisely ascertained".

Lab grown facilities can use solar, wind, nuclear, or hydro and be carbon neutral easily. They also do not require as much land or water and are humane. Cattle require land that could be returned to forests as carbon sinks to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere and cattle tend to foul downstream waters with nitrates. Also, cattle graze(in the best scenarios) the grass to a point where it exposes soil to heavy rain runoff potential, fouling waterways with silt and robbing fields of valuable topsoil. Oh, yes. I almost forgot, then there the methane, too.

From what I told this mostly comes from the fact that the calling range should be so condensed while the opening range has the freedom to try and steal some pots with the hands you have like KQo that make horrible calls from say the CO. When the calling range looks optimal a A T high flop leaves you with very few unpaired hands most of the time having some form of backdoor equity.
Yang comes on the show one time and everyone's immediately jerking his socialist dick off into the sunset without a backward glance as to how other factors might play into whether a basic living wage is actually a good idea in the long term, or whether it might actually just further contribute to the dumbing down and eventual opening up for enslavement of the American people. Not saying Yang is a a bad guy or that his proposed policies have zero potential merit, it's just interesting to watch this group collectively jump on the bandwagon for a policy as radical as UBI, without considering how close to communism and it's associated evils that it brings them.. 
In a statement, Walmart said: "We recognize that our associates with physical disabilities face a unique situation. With that in mind we will be extending the current 60 day greeter transition period for associates with disabilities while we explore the circumstances and potential accommodations, for each individual, that can be made within each store. This allows these associates to continue their employment at the store as valued members of the team while we seek an acceptable, customized solution."

In any case what everyone should watch out for is Scam emails and messages in facebook where you are supose to be awarded or baned for any reason, and you are asked to click a link to verify your account, where you would need to login of course; when you login to that link you don't actually verify anything you just give out your password and account to some hackers. 
What are the odds of hitting two royal flush in one day
I think you are more upset about the lack of respect your husband shows you than the poker nights. If he didn make fun of your baby weight and had the decency to ask instead of just tell you, this probably wouldn even be an issue. Tell him his poker nights are fine, but every time he has a poker night, you will go out for the same amount of time the next day. And do it. Go out with girlfriends, get a pedi, or just do whatever you want. Let him see what having a baby home alone is like. Oh and for goodnes sake, stop making him sandwiches, he a grown man. He can throw some ham and a cheese slice on bread for his own damn self!

If we all moved away from cities to rural property we quickly lose the ability to make major positive innovations to our society. I see so much "I live in rural Indiana and I do just fine" in this thread, but what they really saying is "I live in rural Indiana and I fine as long as millions of other people keep living in big cities living paycheck to paycheck so I have access to the Internet, hospitals, medical breakthroughs, and a functioning government. 
When you have a great starting hand such as AA, KK, AK, or QQ, your goal should be to raise enough to make all but one or two opponents fold.

Keeping aside the high addiction and substance abuse rates in the USA, I have no idea why possession of medical marijuana is a crime? When will lawmakers identify that there is a difference between weed and medicinal marijuana? The weed contains THC which is the addictive and toxic part of the marijuana plant while what is used for therapeutic uses is CBD or cannabidiol. This is the non toxic, non addictive part of the same plant that is a great painkiller, unlike opioids..

The two Koreas both seek reunification of the divided Korean peninsula on their own terms but it has always been a distant aspiration because of the incompatibility of their political systems and their mutual suspicion.

Ah, but we do have 100% certain "simple" models (simple in a sense that a 2nd year Physics student can verify models validity and one can actually measure the effect in lab conditions). Just assume static atmosphere, ignore climatic feedback loops and double CO2, what happens? Turns out: a fairly significant warming happens: 1.2CAnd another thing: we are also 100% certain that humans are adding planetary scale amounts of CO2 to atmosphere.

Having said that, to get to REALLY high stakes PS play money poker you would have to either play for a LONG time on there accruing chips to play that high, or purchase millions (or billions) of play chips from PS. Therefore, i studied poker a ton before I put money onto any website. In retrospect I wish I had put some money onto sites years ago rather than waiting. I would suggest you just deposit a small amount of money that you would usually use for entertainment and play the smallest stakes. If you lose it then you can study, learn from your mistakes and get better, then deposit a little more. Rinse and repeat until you are a winner.

The gastric neurostim isn like a heart pace maker.

Perhaps we should name this brave, new world "post capitalism." Under post capitalism, the primary motivation cannot be profit, but must be people.

Used to enjoy a sandwich crafted by a friend: Toasted bread, with egg salad on one slice, topped with a slice of ham, then a huge dollop of fresh chopped salsa / pico de gallo on the other, a thick onion slice, and some shredded cabbage or lettuce. It was basically a COLD version of the same flavor profile of migas or huevos rancheros without the tortillas. Occasionally adapted by wrapping this all in a flour tortilla too, as a Mexican flavored egg salad wrap.

What is happening is the propagation of bad ideas in the absence of criticism. Religions do the exact same shit. So do anti vaxxers, and moon landing conspiracists, and homeopathic doctors. It is not new, and it is not limited to hate speech. Neither is hate speech a requirement for the spread of idiotic ideas. Hate speech is just a large part of the white supremacist shtick. No matter how you attempt to ban it you will not stop them from spreading their ideas. You will just keep those out of public discussion and away from criticism.

The worst is doing a withdrawal and their site is empty of chp and they have to reload. People win chp they don even have to pay out. So peoples withdrawals are declined until they reload their cashier with chp. If you leave chp on that site you don own it they do. And thats not decentralized poker. Whatever is your personal wallet they should not be able to touch and what is in the players wallets should belong to you. But thats not the case. Its just like any other poker site. Your chp are owned by the site and when they run out you can with draw off the site even though it says you have a ton of coins in your wallet. Its a lie you don own those chp and your wallet chp is just a number there is no chp in it. They have the chp in seperate wallet and they run out even though your wallet says you have your chp. That might be the reason for mass sell off. I sold all my chp after I saw another player and myself get our withdraws declined because they didn have any chp left in their cashier. You can have these kind of problems. And sometimes the mtts dont pop up even though you entered. Also had a mtt recently freeze. Pretty much poorly ran company.

So she and this massage therapist lady end up getting pretty close, they strike up a friendship since they were around the same age and got along.

Might as well make it detailed!So I been really sick for the last week with fever, headache, etc. I spent most of the weekend in bed. I had meetings at the UN though on Monday and even though I went I was absolutely fucked. Couldn move my neck and everything hurt. So during the meeting I was trying to find a non erotic Thai massage, since that always made me feel better back in Japan. I chose Tawan since the yelp reviews were good and it wasn on Istedgade. They charge 400dkk for 1 hour and even have an offer where after 5 visits you get 1 hour Thai massage for free! (make sure you ask for the stamp card).I went in around 6.15PM and was let right into a very clean and nice room. The masseuse (Phan) spoke some English (I used a combo English/Swedish to communicate). So I undressed and laid down and she put on some relaxing music. I asked for a lot of pressure and she definitely delivered! She easily found all my knots and really helped fix my neck so that I could move again. She was damn strong and it was definitely the deepest massage I ever had (inc. Turkish style). She also scrubbed my body with a hot cloth and did some Thai stretching exercises. At the end she gave me some cold water and I checked my watch (1:10 later!). I really felt great at the end there and will definitely be going back.Full disclosure though, she did gently offer a happy ending near the end of the massage. I kindly said no thanks and that was the end of it. But anyway, the massage was fantastic and I saw her change all the sheets and towels when I left the room.

En ce qui concerne le judasme, on constate qu'il est plus enclin que le christianisme  l'emploi profane des matires parfumes. Ces dernires ne sont donc pas interdites   condition de proscrire les fins idoltres  (8). Quant  l'islam, on y retrouve une approche assez similaire  ce que firent des parfums les gyptiens de l'Antiquit :  que le parfum soit libralement utilis, ou rserv  l'change avec Dieu, il s'agit toujours de bannir ce qui fait horreur dans l'image du corps. Ainsi la bonne odeur et les aromates qui la favorisent sont ils signes de puret  (9). On retrouve donc, une fois de plus, l'ide de puret associe au parfum.

So you can do perfectly fine with a +1 unit and it makes it much easier to deal with the IV system.It seems the game is quite generous so getting a few new 5 stars during a month is not unlikely.Getting 5s is easy, getting the one you want is not so easy since the pool of characters has been getting quite large, and aside from Legendary Banners, you can get pity broken by a unit that not on the banner focus which resets your pity change making it a bit harder to get the unit you want.

A related argument is that domestic political processes can hamstring a government in the great game of poker or chess that international politics is supposed to be.

Reduplication seems to be fairly prevalent in Hawaiin as a way to form new words. Simply put, reduplication is the process of repeating a word to change its meaning. For example, in English, we might say that a dog is "super super cute," reduplicating super to emphasize the word. In Hawaiin, they appear to use reduplication to create new words. For example, Wikipedia notes that the word which means "to swim," spawned, through reduplication, the word which means "to bathe."

I too have been to both and found the ladies only shower much more fun. Most of the guys just were not into being at a co ed shower. Mine will be ladies only. I also figured even if we did co ed, the guest list would just be too huge. Even with ladies only it is 30+ people long. My DH (dear husband) was thrilled he would not have to be at the shower. He would rather hang out with the guys else doing something more fun for him. I have heard of some people that the guys do a diaper poker party while the girls do the shower. So that is a thought too if you want the guys to celebrate as well.

There are plenty ofunique design features of the B787 Dreamliner, although it is difficult to show them in pictures. However, one of the biggest design facets of the 787 is the upward curved wingspan, which reduces drag and gives a smoother ride. Also built in to the design of the 787 is a unique filtration system that is said to eliminate (or at least reduce) bacteria and odour in the cabin air, which is a godsend if you sitting next to a smelly passenger! The windows on the 787 are also around 30% larger than on other aircraft, and these windows have LED shades that can replicate the sunrise and sunset. These are found all over the aircraft, including in the economy cabins, and are said to reduce jetlag for all customers. Another important feature of the B787 Dreamliner is that the cabin pressure is different to other aircraft in the sky. On the 787, the cabin is pressured to 6000ft, which is 2000ft lower than normal, and this helps the body absorb over 8% more oxygen. So, it is clear that most of the unique design features of the B787 Dreamliner are intended to give its passengers a much smoother and more comfortable flight, and this is why so many airlines are purchasing it for their fleet.

The entire timeline of how the head wound up in Bellanger's attic is still a partial mystery.

Then, in the early 1900s, a French couple purchased the head from an auction house.

Oddly enough, he even argued (like Dubya) that the US is pursuing the war to "liberate" women. Huh? If we so interested in "liberating" Afghani women, wouldn money spent on schools, health centers, and safe drinking water be more useful than killing people (including women)? Can you imagine a bunch of neocons and Howard Dean sitting around a table saying "US foreign policy should be motivated by the feminist goals of women liberation from patriarchy"? That about as believable as Sarah Palin being an expert on foreign policy.

According to researchers, "Biological systems discussed to be involved in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and the action of mood stabilizing drugs are affected by Mg, such as the activity of the hypothalamus pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) system, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) , GABA  and glutamatergic (via NMDA receptors) neurotransmission and several transduction pathways including protein kinase C" (12). Not only that, but magnesium elicits similar effects on nocturnal hormonal secretion and sleep brain waves to lithium salts, which are used as a treatment modality for bipolar disorder, supporting the role of magnesium as a mood stabilizer (22).. 
Chiquita bananas, formerly known as the United Fruit Company. After their workers became unionized and went on a strike they had the police open fire on them and kill them. They even requested US troops for support, but couldn get them so just went ahead with Colombian police. This happened in Colombia in 1928 almost a hundred years ago, but the lengths they went to silence their workers was insane. For the workers it was either work or go broke, and the strike was a means of raising their wages to something livable. They straight up exploited the local people and silenced them with violence. Chiquita is a terrible fruit company and no one should ever forgive them for what they did. Estimates put the deaths caused on the day anywhere from 40 2000.

Loyalty isn about who respects these imaginary relationship boundaries you insisting exist. My best friend, whom I met when i was 5, dated a guy for a couple of months and decided she didnt like him. A couple of years later, i dated the same dude (for a year) and remained friends with her. She also remained friends with an ex that I would never speak to again, but that isn MY friendship, its hers, so who cares? It doesn affect my daily life, the boyfriend we both dated moved on with his life and we moved on with ours, and we still close friends. Friendship is about respect, yes, but respect for each other and each other lives outside of our own.

Though they had symptoms similar to Celiac Disease, they did not have Celiac Disease. We would give them a negative diagnosis for celiac disease, but they kept coming back with the same symptoms.

Thus, this rewatch comes to a close. What does everyone else think about IBO overall? Personally, it one of my all time favourite Gundam series for reasons I not exactly sure how to express. Sure, there are some issues here and there that I noticed such as off model animation, story being rough at the edges at some point (especially when you consider the fact that the ending had to be rewritten for the last 5 episodes in order to give a better ending to the characters) and Idiok bullshit plot armour keeping him alive until the very last episode.
