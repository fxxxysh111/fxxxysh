But those seem to be the most likely to be the best charities in expectation, given the information that GiveWell  one of the best charity evaluators in the world   is aware of.

The first person I called when I made my decision was the birth father, a friend from high school who had been helping me process the idea that I could be more than a widow. In that impossible conversation, he told me everything I needed to know about what his expectations would be for our relationship   if I kept the baby. He wasn't going to be around as much as I would want him to. He wouldn't have extra money to help out. He and I would never be together. I would be doing it all on my own. And while he would miss being near his child, he trusted me to make the best decision for the both of us.

I do but I'm now guilt ridden. I call Costco to tell them this and CSR takes my name to forward it to a supervisor.

Betting Patterns: If you see a betting pattern emerging where the poker bluffer is betting at pots in late position or on the button, that everyone has checked at, then you can guess that they are either extremely lucky or making a lot of plays. This is where you can either check your big hand to them or even double bluff by re raising them signifying a big hand when really all you have is a great read on their bluff.

I think today when I was lifting I was probably too focused on the descent, but I know I done it more like you described before and that seemed to work pretty well for me. I gonna keep what you said in mind next week, I been kinda feeling like my form has been off lately and I bet if I do what you said that take care of the "weirdness." Luckily, I go to one gym where nobody really cares what you do as long as you don break equipment or bother anyone, and another where the lift stations are pretty decked out so even if you drop the bar it pretty quiet. Either way, I looking forward to next week now.
The Ts on the turn might be the worst card in the deck, but the As on the river is possibly the best. It a great spot to put in a bluff with a four flush, paired board. It also less likely he has a flush as the most likely fd calling the flop is the A high. SPR just about 1:1, he needs to call at >50% frequency. He also has a lot of combo draws here I guess like J9ss,Q9ss,79ss but he can have the pair plus FD comobo fd form the flop of Tx (T9ss etc). I don hate a shove on the river   that line almost looks like you were waiting for him to get a hand and going for value, or even just spiking a four flush with the Ks. I probably would have pulled the trigger there.
Any advice I give you as an old isn gonna apply anyway it way too specific for my age bracket and life stage..

Lege dir einen Notgroschen zur Seite. Manche Spieler spielen bei einem Spiel, bei dem Knnen gefragt ist, einfach nicht clever genug.

Die gehen dann ohne einen Cent in der Tasche nach Hause und mssen ihre Freunde anbetteln. Das passiert dir nicht! Spare dir eine Reserve fr schlechte Zeiten an falls dich das Spiel mal zu sehr in seinen Bann ziehen sollte und du in Sachen Glck mal eine echte Durststrecke hast.
There an old man that eats every day at the restaurant near my work. He has trouble carrying the tray by himself, but typically gets help from the staff. A couple of times though, they hadn spotted him or something, and he couldn pick up his tray. He looked so heartbroken and embarrassed, but without hesitating the guy in front of him put down his stuff and helped him out. Carried his tray over and helped him get settled in at the table. Just one of those small things that makes you smile. I really think most people are good.

Die nette Ferienanlage, in der Rainer mich untergebracht hat, bietet von jeder Stelle, ob Terrasse oder Pool, ohne jedes Hindernis genau diesen Blick. Ein Moment, um nach der Anreise ein wenig zu verweilen und die Aussicht zu genieen. Und auch ansonsten hat die kleine Anlage noch einiges zu bieten. Jedes der 5 Appartements verfgt ber eine Terrasse oder zumindest einen Balkon und es gibt viel Platz rund ums Haus und den Pool, um die Sonne und die Ruhe zu genieen. Denn Ruhe ist ein ganz besonderes Charakteristikum. Gelegentlich hrt man ein schwaches Surren eines Autos, das auf der entfernten Strae nach Puerto Naos" vorbei fhrt.

Ebenso bleibt uns ein erspart, wenn es sich um callen handelt. An der bersetzung gibt es also nichts zu mkeln und das soll schon in dieser schnelllebigen Zeit schon was bedeuten.

Bray Head is a bare and rocky headland which falls steeply on its east side into the Irish Sea. The Dublin to Wexford railway line was built between the cliff and the sea in the 19th Century. Like most of Ireland's railways it was designed by William Dargan, but for this section he consulted with Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The track was a difficult piece of engineering as tunnels and bridges were required in many places, and some sections collapsed into the sea, requiring diversions.

In Chop Suey Nation, Hui puts a unique spin on the subject as she explores her own perceptions of Chinese Canadian (or chop suey) cuisine, its historical and cultural significance, and the stories of families carrying on the tradition in small towns from coast to coast. "I definitely had in my mind, or maybe it was ingrained in me, this idea that chop suey Chinese food was lesser than the 'authentic' stuff; that it was 'fake,' that it was somehow less valid or legitimate than food that actually had its origins in China," says Hui. While Zimmern and others have disparaged it, Hui hopes her work will help others to learn to appreciate it as she has. "This tendency to dismiss this food, to denigrate it has become so common," she adds. Created by early Cantonese immigrants using readily available ingredients   such as cabbage, carrots or celery, but always bean sprouts ("as long as you have water and a bucket, you can grow bean sprouts")   it tells an inspiring story of hardship, persistence and survival.

When four hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium, .7 per cent of the mass is transformed into energy. But if four helium nuclei were fused into oxygen, the mass would decrease by only .1 per cent; and the fusion of two two silicon atoms, if it ever could occur, would release less than .02 per center of th emass. Thus there is no prospect of using elements of medium atomic weight for the release of nuclear energy, even in theory.

The thing is that everybody here is saying that Westerners don care about the genocide and that Turks don get offended if they do. But this is a case of yet another European country recognising it and yet another case of backlash from this community when it was never about them in the first place. It seems like everybody here is just disproving their own points? This thread didn need to be made, and yet here it is. It a self fulfilling prophecy.
(Warning, I really love this show) Oh no I 100% agree. The "Ted Mosby Affliction" has only become more common with social media being used to only show relationship highlights. All of his flaws that they showed are, albeit usually to a smaller degree, pretty common with people today.

Sef started slowing down back in Nov 2016. At first we thought he twisted something in his leg, but the lameness progressed. Then we thought it was a slipped disk in his neck that was compressing some nerves. It turned out to be a nerve sheath tumor. But he was getting old, and he had arthritis and diabetes insipidus (which meant he drank a lot and peed a lot), so it got harder and harder to get around. His bladder was failing him, and it got harder and harder to get in and out of bed or up on the couch. Then in Feb of this year we got another scare when his liver values skyrocketed and the vet though we only had a few weeks left. Somehow he recovered from that (I thank CBD oil) and we got a good 6 more months with him.

Absolutely. The judge sounded like he was doing his damndest to keep Manafort as happy as possible. The sentence was a joke. Manafort asked the judge if he could force the next judge to have her sentence run at the same time as his, and the judge basically said I don't think I have that power but if you find otherwise let me know. What is that shit!? He was hard nosed to the Mueller team, and soft as can be with the Manafort team. Manafort has lived a vile life of greed, drugging and gang raping his wife, having people killed and fucking with the power balance against the best interest of the people of his own god damn nation. He should lose his citizenship and never breathe a free breath again.

CharactersDonald Duck made his first appearance in 1934 and is one of Disney's most popular characters. In fact, he has appeared more often than any other character, including Mickey Mouse. When Mickey Mouse became a cultural icon and was considered a role model by many, Donald was created in order to be Mickey's naughty comic foil who is led into trouble by his short temper. As well as appearing in 150 short films, including the Oscar winning Der Fuehrer's Face (1942), Donald has appeared in numerous full length films. These include Disney Classics such as The Three Cabelleros (1944), Fun and Fancy Free (1947), Melody Time (1948) and Fantasia 2000 (1999). He has also appeared in other Disney films such as The Reluctant Dragon (1941), and performed opposite Daffy Duck in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Donald was first voiced by Clarence Nash in 1934; Nash last played Donald in 1984, 50 years later.

If you are talking about the tremendous storms on Jupiter, then the answer is indefinite. With how large Jupiter is relative to its moons, its unlikely that a moons shadow is able to affect the climate on Jupiter by causing temperature shifts (thus generating storms). We don entirely understand the formation of storms on Jupiter in the first place.

For the past 45 years, Huppert's brilliant, alert, and alive performances have been the fulcrum of films directed by, to name just a few, Claude Chabrol (the late auteur with whom she made 1988's Story of Women, among many other titles, and with whom she is most closely associated), Jean Luc Godard (Every Man for Himself, from 1980), Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher, 2001), and Claire Denis (White Material, 2009). Huppert excels at creating characters who defy simple assessment, the result, perhaps, of exhibiting agile reflexes while resisting overdetermination. As she explains: "The joy of doing it is how this miracle is going to repeat, hopefully.

Weight gain and loss also has a major impact on how skin holds up over time. According to Prevention magazine, the average adult woman loses 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) of muscle and replaces it with 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) of fat every decade. Since fat sits differently beneath the skin than muscle does, it affects how our surface appears, often leading to the development of unwelcome cellulite.

[This is an expansion of an earlier post on Herzog.] In 1982 Werner Herzog, in what may have been the culmination of a weirdly fashioned and irresistible death wish effort, released a film that he wrote and directed: Fitzcarraldo. It is a spill over big, magnificent film about a would be ice making rubber baron bringing an opera house into the trans Andes, trying to make his way into the dense forest in a huge (320 tons) steamboat on the Amazon to stake a claim in exploiting previously un leased lands filled with rubber trees The problem faced by Fitzcarraldo (played by the probably slightly insane Klaus Kinski1 just see Herzog 1972 Aguirre, Wrath of God and you know what I mean) is that his path is blocked by unnavigable rapids he can however reach his destination by hauling his very large ship up and over a mountain to get to a more pliant river and then to his goal.
