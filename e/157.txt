I used to sleep walk. I'm only inferring that this happened but one night I was sleep walking and went into my parents room when they were trying to make my sister a middle child. Next morning my mom asked "hey did you see anything last night when you walked into our room" and I said "I walked into your room last night?" and she sighed in relief saying "oh thank god." I was 8 and didn't know what sex was so I brushed it off.

There is a level of independence in blackjack, and perhaps that solitary sense that a player is facing off individually against the dealer might be part of the appeal. As each player tries to beat the dealer one on one, other players are simultaneously doing the same. There is both a social and non social element to the game play.. 
Now that we know the number of possible hands, we simply divide the number of royal flushes (4) by the above 2598960: 4/2598960 = 0.000001539, the probability of getting a royal flush in the first 5 cards off the deck.

I just don't have the energy or motivation for running at all right now.

Once again as Jekyll, and filled with remorse, he destroys his work and sends money to Ivy, hoping to make amends for Hyde's behaviour. When MGM made this Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde adaptation they purchased the earlier film's screenplay and destroyed all available copies of this version from the then bankrupt Paramount to prevent unfavourable comparisons. They made some minor tweaks to character names and also toned down the earlier film to make it more in line with the Hays Code, making Ivy a more respectable barmaid, although the theme of Hyde personifying Jekyll's lust and sex drive was retained.. 
People have been saying poker is dead for the better part of a decade now, but it clearly still beatable, and some people are still making lots of money. On the one hand, there is still room to beat this game if you good; on the other hand, the games at all limits have been getting harder and harder to beat, people are losing less and less, fish are increasingly scarce, and it is easily conceivable that we could reach a point in the fairly near future where only a small percentage of the best winning players could actually beat the rake. And this is still ignoring the fears that GTO bots could eventually just completely destroy the game..

Maybe you should stop focusing on generalizing all 62 million Trump voters in the same bucket? It easy to pick on the ones who are chanting MAGA while losing their jobs and make fun of them, but this kind of stuff happens with every election. Were all 100% of Obama voters satisfied? I saw many friends disillusioned or even jaded in 2012 when he failed to live up to many promises and their vision of his presidency. Or similarly, there were controversial parts of his administration such as drone killings, ramping up Afghanistan, etc. Do we blame all voters for every mistake?

Sometimes you will be in a hand at the river against two opponents while you have the best low hand and they are both raising. It is extremely likely that you will be quartered in this situation, and you must decide if there is enough money already in the pot to warrant calling all of the raises. Against two opponents, if you have a low and it is quartered, every dollar you put into the pot will return only 75 cents to you.

But where are the regulators in this process? Unfortunately, they have set the tone through their own inspection processes that are used as a validation by the drug companies and CRO's for the bureaucratic systems that we now have.

As well as being extremely durable, familiarity is hard to fake. This makes the system difficult for fraudsters to crack. In the current study, the researchers asked volunteer attackers to watch a successful authentication sequence based on four target faces, so that they could pick out the same four faces from similar test grids. These attacks could be defeated simply by using different photos of the same faces in the test grids. For the user, who is familiar with the target faces, it is easy to recognize the faces across a range of images. For the attacker, who is unfamiliar with the target faces, generalizing across images is difficult.

I went back in the evening to see if the benches worked when it was overcast (they do, but seemed a bit slower to charge) and lo and behold, one of the benches was being used by a small group of friends.

If you visit your local department store in order to pick up a pack of plastic poker chips, such as those offered by Bicycle, you will find that they only weigh about 2 to 3 grams a piece. However, if you visit casinos and play around with clay chips, you may find that they are as much as 10 grams a piece. Ultimately, the weight of a poker chip will be dependent upon the materials that were used to construct the product.

My wife won play this one with me, as she gets way too discouraged by the unrelenting invaders multiplying over the board each turn.

One of the important observations from the Dutch Hunger Winter Study was that intrauterine exposures that have long lasting consequences for adult health do not necessarily result in altered birth weight. Women exposed to the famine during mid  to late gestation had babies with significantly reduced birth weights. Babies whose mothers were exposed only during early gestation had normal birth weights; however, they grew up to have higher rates of obesity than those born before and after the war and higher rates than those exposed during mid  to late gestation (3)"

Sounds like a scammy way to effectively enjoy early retirement to me. And probably relatively easy to manufacture given PTSD is not uncommon among emergency personnel and they would be familiar with the symptoms and how to fake them.

I think the opinion that it was a justified stoppage because he wasn't going anywhere and he was probably going out (if he wasn't actually out already) anyway is weak. You can't make that assumption and act on that assumption to end a fight, especially when it seems like the likelihood of someone going out from a choke not on the neck seems low (judged based on how infrequent that actually happens; when was the last time someone was choked unconscious via a choke not over the neck?)..

1) Invasions need a longer cooldown. The amount of time it takes to take down all 3 envoys (especially because the third one doesn spawn until the first 2 are killed) is just about the same amount of time until the invasion portal opens back up.

An example is a player who is a huge favorite in a hand but loses to an opponent who hits a miracle card on the river (often called a "bad beat").

The next day, they went back in to collect specific items they noted the night before but didn want to take outside (entry 3)  again they wouldn find the key here because they weren searching anything new. I forget the exact order of the next two "searches", but they entered for 8 minutes to get the serial  from the computer in the living room (4), which of course wouldn lead to finding the key in the bedroom. The Crime Lab entered to do luminol testing (5), where they only spraying luminol looking for blood, not searching for any other evidence, so of course wouldn find the key. Then they resumed the search they cut short due to weather (6), and found the key. Later they entered looking for a garage door opener (7). Those were the "seven searches" the tv show is talking about. The key was found on the 6th entry, on the continuation of one actual search. The other entries were brief, and looking for specific items, and they wouldn have found the key on any of them.

Simply learning the ropes of the game is enough to get one started, however, devoting a few hours to attaining the basic strategies of card prediction and card counting is the key to having a higher payout and a better grasp of the more advanced techniques. A short time of practicing these strategic maneuvers will propel a basic player from a run of the mill neighborhood poker night player to a player who would have a great edge in a public casino. If a player knows the more popular and assured strategies like card counting, which is mentally tracking the high and low cards of the deck, blackjack is much simpler to sweep than other card games.
