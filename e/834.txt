Greetings, This is a great question. If you are playing in anycasino, "the cards speak for themselves." This means that if you are involved in a hand and you're not sureif you have won or not, as long as you turn all your cards face upat the end of the hand, the dealer mustcall the winning hand. I have played in some home games that thought otherwise.

Depends on your relationship with poker/gambling and your relationship with that person. I don think I ever had any issues with poker in any of my relationships up to and through getting married, but I was always pretty upfront with everything when getting to know women. "This is my job, it has weird hours, it causes a ton of stress." There are always going to be people that have moral/religious/ethical/personal reasons to be against gambling, and you can really change people minds when it comes to that, so if it an issue of someone just hating gambling because her dad lost the house to a bookie, it probably not going to work out..

So he gets home to have dinner and kiss the kids goodnight, that it.

I was an outreach specialist and case manager at BRC. We would check on the homeless and see if they were willing to accept services. If they accept we had to check the DHS system to see if they are assigned to a shelter. If they are then they have to go back to that shelter. If they are not assigned to a shelter they go to the main intake shelter where they will stay until they are assigned to a shelter. A lot of homeless feel unsafe at their assigned shelters so they choose to stay on the streets or in the subway system. The process of getting reassigned to a new shelter is long and not guaranteed so in the meantime we can drop them off at drop in centers for the night to shower, do laundry, and get something to eat.

A typical level is 12% DHA and 18% EPA. The popular 'salmon' oils (which are not really salmon) are usually of the 12/18 type.Many oils on the market today are from questionable sources and some have high levels of heavy metals or other contaminants such as PCB's.Use fish oils which have been molecularly distilled, or are from impeccable sources with a reliable certificate of analysis.This basically rules out any oil, which is processed from fish caught in the Northern Hemisphere.Most fish oils are of the triglyceride form, which does not easily pass through the cell membranes.Some suppliers of fish oil claim that it does not matter that the EPA is higher than the DHA because the body will convert part of the EPA to DHA.This is TRUE but like the conversion of ALA to DHA the percentage of conversion is very low.This is due in part to the high consumption of Omega 6 in the typical Western diet.Enzymes needed for the conversion are in 'short supply' in the bodies of those people who have a reasonably high level of Omega 6 intake (via vegetable oils).This is because the enzymes needed are 'used up' in having to deal with the processing of Omega 6 oils.As a result, the conversion in most people is quite negligible which further supports ingesting the DHA directly.MOST fish oils are in the triglyceride forms. A triglyceride consists of 3 fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone.

Dude. I have a really good friend who has Been on dialysis for 21 years. He has been diagnosed with liver cancer and then told he was eligible for a mulit organ transplant because of the liver. Then they told him he doesn have cancer and that his urgency for a transplant has been downgraded. Then two days ago he was told he had fibrosis of the liver but his whole system was compromised due to some edict over a month ago saying only half the fluids would be extracted during dialysis sessions leaving him run down and toxic. The hospital has been offering him transplants for over a decade only to pull the rug out from under him every time. I convinced they do not want to take him on as a transplant patient in fear he might screw up their success statistics. He lives alone and this time of year really gets to him. He thinks he going to die alone. I showed him your post. He told me that he knows how one good person in life can make a total shit sandwich better. Thank you for putting this up man.

Thank you Retief Joubert Co. I think if you take a look at the responses on this column I think it is plain and simple that the narrow minded approach to politics in this country is the only way media networks get traction with the readers and interested parties. Sadly, if I do pursue a career as a columnist (which is highly unlikely) I doubt it will be with the very subjective platforms (Excluding Huffington Post) we are provided with in this lovely nation of ours. 
That said, my SO is a private person and I more social, so I often went to lunch and coffee with everyone ever, and during work parties during office hours we stayed away from each other to avoid PDA.

This pattern is caused by elevated cortisol, which is in turn caused by active infection, blood sugar imbalances, chronic stress, pregnancy, hypoglycemia or insulin resistance. These stressors fatigue the pituitary gland at the base of the brain so that it can no longer signal the thyroid to release enough thyroid hormone. There may be nothing wrong with the thyroid gland itself. The pituitary isn't sending it the right messages.

Luckily, we aren't exactly left to fend for ourselves. Every pit boss has a secret panic button under their desk to summon security in case of an emergency. It's actually quite spectacular to see a bunch of black suits appear seemingly out of nowhere and subdue an angry customer. It's even more fun if they struggle, because then security straps them to a gurney to keep them from thrashing. Yes, it's an adult time out bed."But first, I think someone needs to go potty!"
Mostly, many people had to go to the casinos to play and not many could afford the game. It was mostly played by the rich and the mighty in cool evenings after every day's routine work and busy office activities. 
What does that tell you? Basically that you need to have a better that 10% chance of winning the hand to make it worth playing. If you're 4 cards to a flush, you have a 36% chance, so that's definitely a bet you want to make. OTOH, if the guy bets $200 into a $100 pot, you'll end up having to bet $100 on a 4 1 pay off, which means that you'd lose money taking that bet..

Stop by and see our extensive frame collections4. If you scheduled an annual eye exam, plan to have your eyes dilated. A dilation allows the optometrist to better assess the health of the back of your eye. After the dilation, you will not be able to read clearly and you'll be sensitive to light. Your eyes will return to normal in approximately 4 to 6 hours. Please bring sunglasses and do not plan to drive until your eyes return to normal.5. If you cannot be dilated at the time of your exam, a retinal image (Optos) is available for an additional charge. The retinal image can be taken without dilation drops (hence it will not impair your vision). It can reveal to the optometrist more of your ocular health though it does not reveal as much as a full dilated eye exam. Your optometrist may recommend that both tests be conducted.

I saw him at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, "Oh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. 
He had a reputation for crafting clever, biting quips and one liners out of thin air.

I was lucky enough to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium when they had a baby great white in their big tank. They had it there for a while (198 days, according to a Google search, which is about six and a half months) and got it to eat the food they gave it. It hung out nicely enough with the other critters but then had to be released when it attacked two other sharks it shared a tank with. The tank they kept it in is monstrous (one million gallons) and is home to tons of animals that all live together. If the great white had the place to itself it probably would have fared better, but that hundreds of critters that would need to be re homed, plus who knows if the GWS would have been happier for longer, or if she would have become just as depressed or aggressive, or what else could have happened.

This is one of the few sites of its kind on the internet. This site reviews the slot machine games and tells the player what casinos have the particular game. They also provide reviews of bonus feature slots and five reel slots. Slot machines and free slot machines. With the variety of games today, there is no way anyone can know how to play all of them and an information base is welcome. There is also information regarding the number of reels, coin size, paylines, winning combinations, wild symbols, multipliers, etc. This is all the information a player needs to play the game and it is information that he has to acquire if he just starts to play. If a player comes across a game he doesn't understand, he can look it up on this web site and learn all of the details.

Nast drew a grouping of large skyscrapers rising from around the battery (a ferry terminal visible at front center), reaching about 30 stories or so.

I will first preface this with a warning. I don use recipes unless I am baking or doing something precise for the first time. I much prefer to learn techniques and apply knowledge and a sense of taste when doing things like seasoning. Part of that is because questions like "how much garlic" or "how long do I cook" depend on things like taste and ingredients. A particularly strong head of garlic would require less than something a little milder, and visual/taste/aroma/sound indicators of doneness provide a much more accurate and flavorful experience. This of course requires some familiarity with cooking.

Because humans aren't natural logicians, a prediction that almost, but not quite, fits the hypothesis can be difficult to spot. To help find errors it is important that the predictions are formulated in a way that is not ambiguous.

Even elite triathletes, who often train for 40 plus hours per week, include low intensity training in their routines.

Am I the only one who thinks the floor got the string bet ruling completely wrong? If there ruling is correct, then this definately allows for exploits.

Unlike the Republican primaries and the general election, the democratic primaries are distributing their delegates proportionally to the candidates. For example, if Harris won California with 40% and Warren took 30% and Biden and Bernie each took 15%, the delegates would be distributed according to these percentage numbers as well. Ranked choice voting to determine a statewide winner would be a step back into the direction of FPTP here. For example: If someone voted for Bernie as first choice, Biden as second choice and Harris as third choice, his vote would be transferred to Harris as the statewide winner to take all the delegates after Bernie and Biden were eliminated. If now Harris and Sanders are facing off at the DNC, the former Bernie vote from California would be in Harris pockets (because she took all the delegates from CA).

That said, when most poker players talk about variance, what they are really referring to is variance relative to ev (which is really coefficient of variation), since most players are looking to invest their bankroll in whatever the maximal return is for the least risk. For limit, a winning player ev is MUCH lower than in NL since he is limited in how many chips he can get into the middle when he is ahead in limit, making CV much higher..

Another thought would be to hide non dealer hands through some sort of encryption until the hand is completed then publish results to blockchain of players/seats that still remain in the game if more than one player exists at completion. This would save exposure of players who fold yet protect strategy of players that win through elimination of other players (folding)..

I was naive. I had been looking for her for years   she moved her and her sons away when I was in elementary school, and it was way before the internet or anything. They were just gone from my life, and for the 3ish years prior to that, her son and I spent almost every day after school together.

Reconnecting as an adult and having her open her arms to me seemed like an impossible shot at reconnecting to people who meant the world to me as a kid.
Does anyone have any good resources on overbetting strategy or just a bet sizing in general? I ran a bunch of different pio sims and I still can't figure out exactly when it likes overbetting and when it doesn't. In general there seems to be a correlation between our equity range vs range and likelihood of overbetting but there are a lot of exceptions and I'm just not seeing the pattern fully. With the ranges I assigned in one hand, Pio bet flop overbet turn IP on Th6h2d  offsuit 2 or 3 on the turn but did not overbet on an offsuit A turn when the A is even better for our equity than the 2 or 3.

The All in bet" allows a player to bet the amount of money they have left on the table and prevents the opponent from raising the bet. In "real" poker, if the players runs out of money in the middle of a hand and cannot secure credit or a backer to cover a raised wager, they are out of the hand and lose the money they have already placed in the pot. See the movie "Big Hand for a Little Lady" for a comical practical explanation.

James Carleton: The bookies room at an Australian horseracing track. It's the birthplace of our gambling industry and the birthplace of problem gambling as well. The experts are agreed that Australians love a punt, over 80 per cent of us will gamble at one stage or another and yet for a small fraction of us, gambling can have a devastating impact. And that's where the unanimity of opinion ends.

Speakers Corner is often used as an example of how free speech works  religious sorts mingle with homeless people and political radicals to yell and shout and convince their audience that they should be listened to, or laughed at, or even shouted back at.

Jarring if not particularly surprising. RT has a history of saying one thing while actively endorsing the opposite. Last year they released the Pride shirt and had the LGBT panel at RTX and also had an episode of Camp Camp where they made a "bundle of sticks" joke. There a pretty big divide between live action and animation in general in terms of this kind of stuff. It one of those situations where I don think anyone at the company, or at least the forward facing personalities of the company, is homophobic or hateful outright, but there are definitely some people who still do and say stuff that pretty telling of how they actually feel and what they view is acceptable, all while balking at the idea of being homophobic when it called out. You can do homophobic/transphobic/racist/general shitty things without being an overt homophobe/transphone/racist/shit person in general. Of course no one out there beating gay people up, but that doesn mean they can do and say hurtful things to the LGBT community and their LGBT fans, and the fandom and this sub in general just can seem to understand that.
