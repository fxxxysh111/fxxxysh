I 23 but very close with my mom (53) and sometimes I go out with her and her friends. Well quite a few of her lady friends who are late 40s/early 50s are divorced and using dating apps and boy do they filter the shit out of their faces in order to "compete" with the younger girls.

The bigger problem is that two minutes of brushing in the shower uses about five gallons of water, where two minutes of modest faucet usage (even if you're the type who leaves it running the whole time) only uses about two gallons. You don't need a spreadsheet to tell you which one saves the most water.

Gedurende mijn FLP 6 toets bevond ik mij in de rol van behandelend fysiotherapeut. Middels onderzoekend behandelen moest ik een patint met MS onderzoeken en behandelen. Een belangrijk deel van de behandeling is het afsluiten van de behandeling. Dit houdt in dat de patint op de juiste wijze wordt voorgelicht over het verdere beloop en dat de patint eventueel adviezen mee naar huis krijgt. Aan het eind van mijn toets heb ik de behandeling afgesloten met de patint en de patint adviezen meegegeven. Mijn docent heeft dit onderdeel met een ruime voldoende beoordeeld. Ik denk dat ik op niveau 2 zit omdat ik in staat ben om in matig tot complexe situaties te handelen volgens de competenties van dit competentiegebied. Van deze matig complexe situaties heb ik inzicht in de feiten, theorien, principes en de regels en ik kan dan ook in diverse situaties vanuit de opleiding mijn specifieke kennis en vaardigheden laten zien. Zo kan ik bij het competentie gebied op matig complex niveau problematiek inschatten en hierop anticiperen. Hierbij doel ik in het specifiek op de situaties die de opleiding schetst bij de eerste hoofdfase van de opleiding. Daarbuiten hebben mijn stagebegeleiders mij op dit niveau beoordeeld middels de KVA  lijst op de eindbeoordeling.

The girl who took my virginity when I was 19 had been with close to 30 guys and she was 21. It fucked with my head a bit at the time, and I was super blue pilled.

There are so many factors that contribute to current strength and future gains. Things like nutrition, training program, sleep, stress, genetics. To make meaningful strength gains make sure you are eating enough probably around 3000 4000 calories assuming you do a full workout. Workout 4 5 days a week. Ensuring that you give each muscle group 48 hours to recover. Form could be a little better. It looks a little unstable. But there no glaring issue. It looks uncomfortable.

Don't let him grab any throwable objects. He will throw them at you, destroying your cover depending on how big it is. The best way to stop him is to simply shoot the object.

Now that isn't to state that all losses have been reversed, but that the aggregate whole has been reversed and this is an excellent example of why one shouldn't panic and sell all their holdings immediately upon a market downturn.

They call to tell me to pick up the box. I do but I'm now guilt ridden. I call Costco to tell them this and CSR takes my name to forward it to a supervisor. Supervisor eventually calls me back to say keep it, that FedEx is responsible for reimbursing them and it's not worth it to her to go through the circle of hell dealing with FedEx again.
As a consequence of his mother making a deal with Azazel (she was young, and she needed the money!) Sam was infected with demon blood when only six months old.

A continuation of the previous course where we look at how to improve application performance while focusing on maintainability. Students introduce application monitoring to the system and see how to AutoScale based on performance metrics. Application deployment strategies are discussed and we see how to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to quickly deploy and update application code. Then students focus on performance by introducing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and application cache to the solution. In each module, students learn about the core AWS technologies and best practices for each.

"The mechanism that we've described in this paper   the ability to ignore the expected consequences of our movement   gives us the extra cool ability to detect when we've got it wrong. So if I play the piano just right, I hear it, sure, but my auditory cortex is pretty silent. But when I play it wrong, I get a much larger response."

My favorite comment from this article review:  CoQ10 deficiency is completely preventable with supplemental CoQ10 with no adverse impact on the cholesterol lowering or anti inflammatory properties of the statin drugs. We are currently in the midst of a congestive heart failure epidemic in the United States, the cause or causes of which are unclear. As physicians, it is our duty to be absolutely certain that we are not inadvertently doing harm to our patients by creating a wide spread deficiency of a nutrient critically important for normal heart function. are drugs that reduce cholesterol by inhibiting an enzyme in the liver known as 'HMG CoA reductase' which 'drives' cholesterol production (most of the cholesterol in the bloodstream is made in the liver and does not come directly from the diet).

Maybe they more popular than I realize. Overall, I think most people outside of punk don know about them despite being very active pushing nearly 30 years. They aren terribly unique in their sound, they haven broken any molds or defined genres, and their musicianship is frankly terrible considering how long they been a band. I think they get thought of as a novelty band, whereas in my opinion a lot of their songs and lyrics are on par with the the punk rock elite that are credited with pushing boundaries such as DK, Bad Religion, Minor Threat, etc.

Arguably UND is more selective since it only considers North Dakota residents. It is an instant denial to not be from North Dakota and apply there so no one bothers.

It's a fairly light call with AQo for stacks, but I'm sure I could have just checked back the turn and folded brick Rivers had I thought about this situation more thuroughly.

If it was a conspiracy, then the conspiracy started with oxycodone production and pill mills which was the source of our current epidemic.

One that comes to mind is a woman named Amber Lockes who had three bear pets, one of them being a cub which is much more rare due to mom bear protective nature.

Well we've moved into the hospital accommodation and it really is quite comfortable. The unit is big, and has a good size kitchen and bedroom, and also lounge where John has opted to sleep on the large sofa   believe me, it's softer than the beds, which are like concrete.

Saying that, LivingStones definitely has a strange feel to it as far as churches go. They have a large number of young people at their downtown location and claim to be very open and accepting, but that probably only reaches as far as their idea of what is acceptable.
My biggest pet peeve always has been and always will be the sunday/holiday scheduling. Like fine, I understand less people, less shoppers so less frequent transit. BUT if you are only going to have a bus run once an hour DONT MAKE EVERY BUS ON THAT ROUTE ALSO RUN AT THE SAME TIME. When I was doing my masters degree I would often go to the U of M on sundays to get extra work done and go to the gym after, and it infuriated me to no end that the 60, 160 and 170 all ran within 5 minutes of each other down Pembina. So if you missed one you basically missed them all and had to wait until the next hour to get home.

In terms of spreading the EA message, the support we've received from within the poker industry, especially the poker media, has been very encouraging   they've been very keen to help spread our message. We've had a number of very high profile players give interviews about why they donate and why the cause resonates with them, and we've had support from a number of businesses within the industry. There's still plenty of room to improve on that though   poker is a billion dollar industry and there's a lot of fundraising opportunities out there..

Moving stuff: Baselayer and fleece, in whatever combination, selected so that I rarely have to remove and carry the fleece. For those types of temperatures, a heavyweight baselayer and a zip up hoody fleece (MH Microchill is what I have) would be my go to, although I might go light base+Melanzana+Microchill, if I were confident that it wouldn warm up so much that I have to carry the Melly. Basically, during the hottest part of the day, my ideal is to have an unzipped hooded fleece over a base layer (and possibly over the Melly, too, if it cold)..

Mediation, especially when it is at the instance of a court, is a welcome option for those embroiled in protracted civil disputes. A compromise could indeed be preferable to an order that may leave one side aggrieved. However, it is questionable whether this principle can be applied to all disputes and in all situations. The Supreme Court's order appointing three mediators to find a solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute is quite strange and incongruous, given that all such previous attempts have ended in failure. Further, the case is ripe for final hearing, and not all parties favoured mediation. The dispute over the site at Ayodhya, where a 16th century mosque stood until it was torn down by Hindutva fanatics in December 1992, has remained intractable since 1949. After the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the President referred to the Supreme Court the question whether there was a temple to Lord Ram before the mosque was built at the site. The court, in a landmark

Said, the idea of life on Mars had mostly lost its pinkish pulse by 1920, though people still were still tinkering with ideas of how to communicate with alien forms of life over vast distances.

If after reviewing the disclosure you feel that you don really have a defense you can show up a little early to court and talk to the prosecutor. The prosecutor usual sits at a desk outside the courtroom and reviews people cases as they check in. When you go up to the prosecutor desk you can ask if they would be willing to accept a plea bargain for a reduced charge. The prosecutor is usually willing to offer you a deal in exchange for a guilty plea and will almost certainly offer you some kind of reduction at this point. If you like the deal they are offering you can accept it. Once you accept the deal you will be called up in front of the Justice of the Peace and asked if you are willing to plead guilty to the reduced charge, if you say yes the JP will rubber stamp the deal and that will be that.

The hard part of analyzing this hand for me, is, what is in their flop donking range? I much rather check call with anything I continuing with, then probably check call the turn with weaker aces and boats, and check raise stronger aces to extract value from weaker aces. Donking with the nuts seems bad, donking with a strong ace seems bad, and donking with a weak ace seems bad..

Koster used a light wand   a tiny light and camera battery   on video poker machines, the government said. Attorney Paul Lochner wrote in the indictment. The government said Michael Leo Patterson, Cheryl Rose Steinsiek, Vannessa Dale Robb, Bruce Kirby Robb and Jeffrey Paul Neighbors helped Koster. They allegedly acted as lookouts for casino security workers, or as "blockers," to prevent passers by, security personnel or security cameras from seeing Koster using the light wand. The others allegedly cashed out winnings at the casino cash cage, or made travel arrangements. Many traveled from Oklahoma, records said. Koster and others stayed 52 weekends   Thursday to Sunday   during the two years the alleged crimes took place.

So we know that regardless of whatever the current "trend" strategy is on how to get more value out of your flopped 2 pair on a flush draw board, we always know that we want to bet at least 3/4 the pot if not more to give worse odds for opponent to chase when facing a single opponent likely to call and we also know that if we chasing our draws with incorrect odds we risk losing more than we win over a large sample. The odds don change but the strategy can based on the situation.
With the issues of property and support behind them, the couple still had one more fight to fight: who would pay the legal costs?

The wife disregarded Justice Conlan direction regarding costs, filing submissions that were both too long and late (the judge nevertheless considered them).

Depression, a life threatening psychiatric disorder, lies at the confluence of biochemical, hormonal, immunological, and neurodegenerative variables, which intersect to generate the pro inflammatorystate with which depression is associated. A major public health issue, depression is estimated to become one of the top three contributors to the global burden of diseases within a few years. Not only does depression consume a sizable portion of health care expenditures, but it is considered to be an independent risk factor for metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric disorders (1).

In truth we have forsaken the right to call Iqbal our national poet. What commonality is there between his poetry and our way of life? The way our leaders conduct themselves   fawning when they should know better not to, listening to lectures when they should have the wit and understanding to educate foreigners about the reality of Pakistan and its neighbourhood   shows no sympathy or connection with Iqbal. There should be no commemoration of Iqbal Day and no changing of the guard at his tomb   betwixt Lahore's great mosque and the imposing faade of Akbar's fort   until we learn to conduct ourselves with greater national dignity.. 
They were camouflage1 artists employed as magicians, Wartime Magi, employed/drafted to make ships and such disappear.

That must been a very odd position to wake up to every morning.

All right, I take the downvotes. That a popular stance, but the truth is much more complicated than that. Korea was one of the least developed nations in Asia when the Japanese showed up, reform efforts notwithstanding, and was the second (or third) most developed when they left, depending on how you reckon development. Yes, any development that was undertaken by the Japanese was obviously for their own benefit, but there were Korean stakeholders in those enterprises, including some stockholders, and Japanese assets were handed over to the Koreans after the war. Textile factories were among these and were important to Korea later entry into manufacturing, as was the basic model of how to organize a corporation and the relationship of the state to those corporations.
