Did you happen to catch the front page thread awhile back, about how anti littering campaigns were created to shift blame from wasteful industries onto consumers, so that those industries wouldn be regulated?

It pointless to ask tens of millions of people to change their behavior when you could just put completely reasonable, common sense, beneficial to all regulations on a handful of industry practices and solve the problem at its root. The same thing can be applied to our political situation; even if Republican voters "should" be blamed based on some abstract argument, it completely impractical to do so.

He similarly thought big when he hired Morgan Stanley to value THP towards the end of the decade. He wanted the best possible advice even though he had no experience dealing with investment banks and the fees they rack up. But his view is that you only become big if you think and act that way. It is as well to remember that all big companies started out small once upon a time.

Poker is a lot like a waiting game: Most of the time, a player receives more bad hands than good, but once the strong hands come, if a player plays smart they can reap the rewards (depending on what they are playing for, of course). It is also a game of strategy. Sometimes, bad hands can serve a player a silver platter. They can use these hands to their advantage to bluff other players. Mind you, it is not recommended to do this all the time, as people will eventually catch on. but if it is the right time, bad hands can turn out to be strong after all.

So employers will have to raise the price of food again so they can pay $2 $3/hour more then minimum wage to make the job more appealing.

 3 points  submitted 10 hours agoThe Fog Game (Mistwedstrijd in Dutch) of 1966 was when Ajax beat Bill Shankly Liverpool 5 1 at De Meer, in a fog that was so thick that spectators could only find out about a goal being scored through hearing the cheers of the players. It considered to be the start of Ajax golden page that lasted until the 70s.And the reason Veltman came on that late is twofold. He barely match fit, having had only one late substitution against NAC since his return, and he even slower than Mazraoui.scarfdontstrangleme  48 points  submitted 1 day agoIk heb het debat niet gezien, maar is het niet een beetje nutteloos om een debat te houden met de landelijke lijsttrekkers voorafgaand aan de Provinciale Statenverkiezingen? Mij lijkt het bijvoorbeeld een beter idee om op iedere lokale omroep een apart debat te hebben met lijsttrekkers voor de desbetreffende provincie.

I suffered for years with an undiagnosed autoimmune disease. I gained weight, retained fluid in my legs, had pain all over my body, was tired all the time, and so much more. I was told that it was all in my head, and was even put on medication for various mental health disorders when the doctors gave up on trying to figure it out (which made many of my symptoms worse). When I found a doctor who was finally able to give me a diagnosis the only thing my dad could say to me was "good. Hopefully now the weight will come off." I was finally pain free after years off suffering and all my dad cared about was how much I weighed (size 12AUS by the way. That's a pretty average size)

The Youtube videos I linked were not on the whole videos that I necessarily believe in, but were clearly used as citations for specific facts of which I could not find the particular source. Every link I have sent are in regards to what Hillary Clinton has actually said, and what the Commander in chief of the United States Military Corps has said, and if you came to this debate without an agenda, you would clearly see what I was intending to reference, independent of the material surrounding it. What you say about "her rhetoric and threats might have given Russia pause over their actions" is a legitimate idea, and I will consider that moving forward, however this does not answer the question of why Russia has aligned with Trump you off topic, and you muddying the waters, I just looking for actual debate on why you expect Russia/Putin to align with Hillary over Trump..

I mainly disagree. The only boats this guy can have are pocket sixes and pocket aces. Maybe A5 but I don't think he checks flop w 2 pair. And I think folding turn bet of $20 in this size pot is way too weak with 22 on this board. Unless hero only puts him on a weak ace. He can have a lot of other hands. I don't love the raise on the turn. I'd just call. But the way it was played worked out this time. I don't mind the creative line and you can maybe even go bigger.

I didn't realize she would have to return to Brazil under the terms of the K1 visa if she wanted to remarry and stay here in the US. I have a feeling her lawyers are the reason she stopped posting all those party pics with her new boyfriend. That can't look too good for her case.

I'm worried about this too! She's been underwhelming and inconsistent. At least Kevin won restaurant wars.

Streaming I feel needs to find a way to plug that hole or I couldn consider it progress.

If you mismanage degenerative tendinopathy in an NBA athlete, especially quadriceps tendinosis, you can have very bad things happen. An example of this is Blake Griffin. The quad injury that kept Blake sidelined the majority of the 2015 2016 season and playoffs was degenerative tendinopathy of the quadriceps that was mismanaged and led to a partial rupture of the quadriceps tendon. Even with rehabbing this injury, Blake has lost some of his explosiveness and is still at very high risk to re injure that tendon.

And a lawsuit would have backed them because, you know: They wouldn have done it without knowing they could win, or at least make more out of the deal than his suit would cost them.

0My background is i have been playing poker for recreation and small stakes for a little under 10 years, Whenever i used to go to jail (often) I played cash games everyday in order to eat, And can only remember 3 5 times i left the table below what i entered with. My game play is looser at home games because it is with friends and drinking, So i would say my win/loss is about 50:50 at home games. My online WSOP account is 25m the second highest of my 900 facebook friends, and the only time i played at the casino i more than doubled my money. My recent success at the casino coupled with the fact that i consistently won at the table in jail makes me want to pursue it as a secondary/supplemental income. The success playing in jail really is a major factor in my confidence since it was 8 hours a day at the table with cash stakes playing against other people who did the same thing, 8 hours a day at the cash stakes table, for upwards of 1 year, while walking away less than flush 5 or less times. And yes, i was very impulsive when it came to drugs but when sober, poker has never been a problem when it comes to impulse control. Like i said in another reply, i intend to exclusively stick to 1$/2$ blinds hold em and enter in to it with a 600$/300bb bankroll in order to be able to have a safe buffer against runs of bad cards and potentially getting bled by blinds.

I can speak for the others but the reason I don comment much on the sub, or on reddit in general, is that moderating takes most of the time and energy I want to spend on reddit already. Also, any comments I make about anything can and will be used by those who disagree as some proof of bias when making moderator decisions. On any decision, we damned if we do and damned if we don so I rather not give people ammo when I don need to. uReallyShouldTrustMe already gets false reports on some of his comments on the sub just because someone is butthurt about what he says or how they believe he should behave as a moderator.

Now over a month and a half after the initial injury I'm only able to ride steady flat miles, but I can't really pull up with my left leg (the same side I strained the adductor on).

I don understand your question regarding patterns. if you "often" don know why a good move looks/feels good, then you need to analyse these more. There are plenty of strategy elements, so if the move is good, you need to find out which strategy element is the reason that this feels good and actually is good. if you just sometimes (as in "don always") have this problem, I guess you can let this go. :)
Honestly, an incompetent administration is just one of the symptoms of a failing school, not so much a cause. The good administrators leave when money runs sparse and the work environment becomes stifling and are employed elsewhere, while the incompetent failures stay because they can get jobs elsewhere.
