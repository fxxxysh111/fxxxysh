I mean, I don personally think f!Byleth costume is really wildly sexual so much as it just got a bunch of of baffling design choices, like they wanted it to be kind of sexy but couldn really pull it off. But the point I making is firstly that if male characters aren designed with being attractive as the first priority then female characters shouldn be, and secondly that a lot of female sexualization is uncomfortable and denigrating to women while a lot of male sexualization is generally respectful to men.

The improvement will be that more classes (hopefully all) will be included in end game content. At this time Paladins and Clerics are dominating end game as heavy buffers and dominating the content, pretty much ignoring the battle mechanics that regular players have to deal with. One simple change is removing "power sharing" from the Clerics and Paladins, which is what is making their steamrolling possible. It not an exploit but the benefits of it are on that level. That creates a "only one way to end game" attitude, which will eventually kill any game unless it is addressed.

Arkansans will be equally unwilling to take the first step toward the full legalization of marijuana for recreational use, which is a major impetus for "medical marijuana" laws, according to some of the national leaders of the movement. CPAV contends that "if there are components of marijuana (THC, for example) that render medical benefits for patients suffering from certain maladies, there are more efficacious, safer, and saner ways to deliver the THC rather than the smoking of marijuana cigarettes. Components of opium have proved to have medical benefit, but the FDA has not approved the smoking of opium or heroin. Instead, medical science extracted the beneficial components and developed medicines such as morphine, codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone. The same has been done and is continuing to be done with marijuana."

Of course nothing is guaranteed, like any treatment (and nothing was guaranteed in the past) but they seem confident of at least killing most of the tumor/tumors. Pete is scheduled for this therapy tomorrow afternoon, so today they have given him some antibiotics and also about a litre of vitamin fluid straight into the vein, as his nourishment levels are slightly low. The radio seed therapy will cause swelling and some pain, so because Pete won't be able to eat because of that swelling, they are going to also insert a nasal gastric feeding tube, so that if he finds it too difficult to eat, he will be able to take liquid food through this tube.

Non Compete Clause At times, an independent contractor agreement for massage therapists will include a non compete clause. This section addresses whether or not the massage therapist can service clients in a specific radius of the company when she leaves. When this provision is included, it typically includes a distance and amount of time. For example, the agreement could be that the massage therapist cannot work for any location for a year within a 30 mile radius, so as to not take away the company's clients.

Skeletal muscle is the type of muscle that we can see and feel. When a body builder works out to increase muscle mass, skeletal muscle is what is being exercised.

Little confused. You said it was the BB who 3 bet you pre and you were UTG. Didn he check before you on the flop? As far as leading on this flop as played. I don mind that sometimes at all. The ONLY issue I see as played is it almost turns your hand face up. Very unlikely you do this with KK, QQ, etc. Also likely not with AA. So your range when you lead is exactly what you have or AQ, maybe AJ suited. Would not want to do this all the time but in this spot I think it is a good option. You can always bet/fold if someone shows more strength on that flop if you had the right read.

Uhmmm. I could never save money either, OP, not till I was pushing 40. Then I started trying to figure out why I frittered away every dollar I got in my paycheck. The answer I came up with : I did it so my mother wouldn't take it away from me. I couldn't give her money on demand if it was already gone!. Your mom claimed she would repay $200 a month (for 3 or 4 months?) to get a laptop for your sister. You knew damn well that if she wouldn't save up that money there was no way in hell she would ever bother to repay the money if you 'lent' it to her. I suggest you read some good books on money management (I liked Your Money or Your Life) and never let your mother know you are not as profligate with money as she is. Keep your savings account a secret. Continue to offer to pay rent but not give her large sums of money or even small ones for her convenient amnesia. If she does start accepting room and board money from you, keep good documentation. I think you're doing great in the finances area for a woman your age.

As technologies go, the Internet is still a baby. You can trace its roots back to the 1950s, when computer technology itself was quite young. In the 1960s and '70s, teams of engineers and computer scientists worked to build the foundation for a network of networks. ARPANET, one of the Internet's predecessors, began modestly as a three node network. Gradually, smart people began to link networks together using protocols from the ARPANET project. In the 1980s, this network proved to be a valuable tool for research and communication. A decade later, the general public became aware of the Internet as tools like the World Wide Web made it easy for the general user to access it.

Well as soon as you turn on the camera you would have already captured the atmosphere which is in a perpetually polluted state. I also think it would be a great thing to film educational videos in many different languages on how to separate rubbish properly which is something that many of you seem to have some trouble doing properly, unless of course you live on a US military base which is pretty much exempted from pollution restrictions. Filming any food item should be fine as well since they haven yet been granted any civil rights as far as I know.

Never show your hand if you win refers to not showing your hand if you bet, and everyone else folds. In that case, you win no matter what the community cards (the five cards in the middle of the table) are. If you win this way in an earlier betting round, they won't even finish dealing the community cards out. In those cases, you're totally allowed to just throw your cards away face down (wait for them to push the chips your way).

Not to mention this state has been pwned by major storms for 3 straight years, it seems unjustified to me to ask that from the state, just so you can self fellate over the latest US News World Report. Even if Florida manages to upset Gerogia and make it to the SEC championship game, I do not think they can win it. In my mind every other team that plays in a conference with a championship game has a chance to win it. I have Florida as the first team out of the top 10. Adding Florida would also have made for four SEC teams, and since I am already being accused of SEC bias perhaps it was best I left them out.

Really good singers will emote well enough in whatever language to translate the drama and pathos, which is the main thing I like out of vocals dominated music anyway.

Granted that the present political conjuncture, in which the Democratic Party controls the presidency and Senate, and the Republican Party, the House of Representatives, creates the possibility for gridlock. However, the separation of powers, even with divided partisan control, does not guarantee gridlock. During previous periods in American history, divided government did not prevent compromise. In the 1980s, Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker of the House Thomas ("Tip") O'Neill, Jr famously delivered bombastic partisan speeches during the day   after which they adjourned to the White House Family Quarters to socialise. Their camaraderie enabled them to negotiate political compromises across the partisan and ideological divide.

Perhaps most importantly, the laws and such depended on the period of Roman history which is being discussed.

That seemed strange to me too. He doesn even live in LA full time, why does he not live with his family when he there? I get why Khloe might feel she doesn want him around all the time but then maybe she can also admit that this incident didn destroy a family and that their relationship was rocky at best? If Tristan had any respect for Khloe he wouldn have a bunch of 20 year olds over at his house to party all night, not Jordyn or anyone. While she certainly doesn deserve all the hate (and Tristan should be getting alot more) it does sound like Jordyn was very comfortable around him   she didn sit on him but she had her legs on his legs?? The young and drunk apology felt a little cheap tbh.
If you have long been an admirer than you would know that Peterson advocates for discussion between the right and the left to create a balance.

During a median follow up of 6.8 years, dementia developed in 524 participants (74 with diabetes and 450 without). Among participants without diabetes, higher average glucose levels within the preceding 5 years were related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.01); with a glucose level of 115 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter) as compared with 100 mg per deciliter (5.5 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio for dementia was 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.33). Among participants with diabetes, higher average glucose levels were also related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.002); with a glucose level of 190 mg per deciliter (10.5 mmol per liter) as compared with 160 mg per deciliter (8.9 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.76).

1) Preparation. One way to prepare yourself for anal sex with a big penis is butt plugs. Get one butt plug as large as the diameter of your partner penis and one or two smaller ones. Use the smaller ones as if necessary, and work up to being able to insert the largest one. You can wear a butt plug during the day to prepare for anal sex that evening, or wait to insert it prior to foreplay. If you wear it while having vaginal sex, he will love how tight it makes your vagina feel. Once you able to insert and wear the large butt plug, penetration with his penis should then be fairly comfortable.

'Grandparents rights' (as I understand them) would be for visitation under special circumstances  like if Parent A dies and Parent B won't let Grandparents on A's side see the kids anymore.

Note that any small business involves some amount of risk that the business could fail and the owner could go broke. So while risking a large bankroll as a professional poker player might not be like going to a 9 to 5 job and getting a paycheck every week, it is a lot like opening a restaurant and hoping that it won't be one of the 60% that fail. And it's actually less risky in some ways, because it's relatively easy for a small business to operate on credit, whereas poker players usually use their own money for their bankroll, so poker players can at least just walk away and not worry about direct effects on their debt or credit rating..

It actually better for shipping to always ship boxes because you can now calculate other packages than go on top and all that. As in, the box is not for last mile delivery but rather before that in the chain. A container full of goods as an example, is a lot cheaper per ware you have in that container if you can fill it to the literal last cm, which you do by basically letting a computer play 3d tetris with the packages. Doesn need to be perfect squares exactly, but the less variation in the shape, the less to calculate and the more possible combinations.

As to orange   I have seen poems where a word was broken at line's end with the final syllable(s) at the start of the next line so that the partial word on the end of the line DID rhyme where needed.

I explicitly said I wanted to be at my parent house by 6pm (hour drive) for thanksgiving cause that is when my brother would be arriving and I was really looking forward to seeing him, and he fucked it up. An hour before we had to leave I was packed and ready, and he was still doing nothing. When it was actually time to leave, I was standing at the door with bags in hand and the big manchild said out loud that he needed some milk and cookies. He completely ignoring me saying we needed to go now cause this was important to me. As he sat down with his milk and fucking cookies, I told him I had it and was driving myself there and he could follow. When ex did arrive, he was grumpy because he had to drive and he hates driving and was basically an asshole the rest of the night. Instead of spending the rare time with my whole fam, I spent nearly an hour trying to soothe/get him set up in the den with tv so he wouldn be such a cunt to be around. There had been a lot of similar selfish stuff, but this event was the straw.

You spot on. The people will not be put above corporate donors by Kamala. A candidate IS their own donor roster and voting record on issues. Cross referencing LEGITIMATE data is the absolute least any voter should be doing. Know your ideals, your morals, your day to day living as an American, and see who matches up the best. Research the history of a candidate. Be as certain as you can be, as educated as you can be, on candidates you considering. DNC is in overdrive, prescribing a candidate, overtly and passive aggressively signaling for voters to see dirt on others when there is none. Kamala top donor is Time Warner, which owns CNN. Who has been giving her a ton of coverage and as early as 1/29, a town hall.

Sibling relationships are also the source of a lot more conflict than voluntary friendships and one of the biggest social development benefits is that as a result children with siblings become better at managing conflict than only children.The tendency to be friends with people in your age group goes beyond children; even elderly people show the same preference.

If you have a bank roll of a hundred bucks you don want to be playing in a game where the minimum bet is fifty of it. If you doing it like that then you just trying to get lucky and that is definitely not something you want to do. If you plan on playing professional Texas Holdem you need to minimize the use of luck and maximize the use of skill in the game. To do this a good tip is that you need to have at least thirty to forty max buy ins. That means if you playing the 1$/2$ game the max buy in is probably going to be two hundred bucks. Multiply that by forty and you get 8000. That is a very conservative approach but it definitely is the best one that you can use. If you really serious about becoming a professional poker player this tip a long will take you a long way. Don play above your limits. You can withstand a lot of the aspect of the game and you can consistently beat the levels you are playing at if you just have good bankroll management.
