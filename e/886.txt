That is hypocritical. You are assuming things about me and in the next breath telling me not to judge or assume things about a person based on such little information. I not assuming anything about this guy. I saying he did a shitty thing and the context of why he might have done it doesn matter.

In order to determine how many chips that you will need to be included in the set that you will purchase, you must first consider how many players you will average per game. If you feel as if you may play with a team of up to approximately ten players, it is appropriate to have approximately 500 chips in the set that you elect to purchase. Based on denominations, this would result in each player receiving up to $1,000.00 worth of chips. In order to achieve this, you would need the denominations of $5.00, $25.00, and $100.00. Each of the ten players would receive 20 chips in the $5.00 denomination, 16 chips in the $25.00 denomination, and 5 chips in the $100.00 denomination.

I walked around, still wearing the sweater, asking several people if they seen my wallet. Finally sat down with a friend to have a smoke, shrugging about the lost wallet. He asked me for a lighter, I reached into my pocket, and pulled out my FUCKING WALLET.

There was no one around who would have stolen it and slipped it back in, nor had there been an opportunity for anyone to do so, as I been wearing it the whole time.

Self fish and to take from others and not give a crap about others. That is satanism. Its not just about the worship of the devil, but an ayn rand thought process. Also don forget ayn Rand was a communist and atheist. To me she just seemed like she was covering up her following of satanism.

Oh that's nothing. I evicted my last tenants when I found they were keeping two dogs in cages in the basement (in their own piss and shit) and extra people were living with them in places that weren't even legal rooms. They were hoarders. They decided to throw half their shit into the state protected wetlands behind the house (still my property, and I would have been fined for it during the yearly state inspection). It took weeks of bleach treatments to get the dog smell out of the cement floor in the basement. We lugged truckloads of stuff out of the wetlands and had to pay to dump it all. All of the carpets were replaced and they also left the propane tank (which they were responsible for filling at the end of the lease) bone dry. The security deposit didn't come close to covering the damage. I ended up selling to my next tenant and he even still found some stuff buried in the wetlands when he went to do work on the place. Thankfully he was very chill about it.

There is a small cupboard sized room, off the upper storey 'long gallery' at Little Moreton Hall, called the 'garderobe' (no, not the French 'wardrobe' in this case) and in it lies a plank of (hopefully) smooth wood with a hole in the middle about 10" diameter. There are holes in the ceilings and floors through to the slowly running moat (we looked down to see this!). They told us that it had not been used (to their knowledge anyway) for about two hundred years! Another one on the first floor 'discharged' into coffin like boxes on the ground floor, that had to be emptied daily by the servants, washed in the moat waters, and placed ready for the next 'customers'! No danger of 'splashback' then, from that height!

It cuts down on the amount of dust produced by a forced air furnace and seems to help reduce certain allergies.

The major advantage of prefab housing is that manufacturers can build within a large, climate controlled indoor factory, at a much faster rate, while demolition, excavation and foundations are concurrently completed on the actual site.

Compare that to an approximately 24 month conventional construction timeframe for a similar project. Construction disruption to the surrounding neighbourhood is also significantly reduced.

Add half a yellow onion, finely diced, to the bottom, after it has time to cook and start to turn translucent, add some minced garlic and just flash fry for 30 seconds to a minute. Don let it burn. Now add your rice. Stir it around a little to get the rice coated in oil, then let it sit. Don touch, let it sit until it has just turned golden brown on the bottom, then start stirring, getting color across as much of the rice as possible. This produces some parts that are crunchy and well textured like the bottom of a bibimbap, as well as keeping large, soft bits perfect for scooping up with some chicken.

If this happens when all the cards are out and you get in a raising war with someone, don't stop! Raise until one of you runs out of chips. If there is the possibility of a tie, the rest of the table may clamor for you to call, since you "obviously" both have the same hand. 
Straight: Five cards in sequence, but not in the same suit. A straight cannot wrap, meaning it is not a straight if you have a Queen, King, Ace, Two, Three. The higher straight wins if two or more people have a straight. In case of straights that tie, the pot is split. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value. The highest set of three cards wins. Two Pair: Two separate pairs (eg. 4,4,Q,Q). As usual the pair with the higher value is used to determine the winner of a tie. Pair: One pair of two equal value cards constitutes a pair. High Card: If no one has any of the above winning hands, the tie is determined by the highest value card in the hand. If the highest cards are a tie then the tie is broken by the second highest card.

What are satellites and how do they work? Basically a satellite is a way to enter a major tournament and play for big money without having to pay the large buy in required. For example, the buy in for the World Series of Poker (WSOP) is $10,000. An on line poker room could sponser a tournament with a $1,350 buy in (they will also charge somewhere around 9 10% for a registration fee). For every 10 players in the tournament there would be a prize pool of $13,500, enough for the single buy in to the WSOP and some extra for spending money. So for a $1,350 you could win your entry to the major tournament. If there are 100 players then the players who finish in one of the top 10 positions would be on their way to Las Vegas and a chance at $10,000,000, the estimated top prize in this years tournament.

I quite liked a cocktail bar, then they did this. Sitting at the bar, a collection of 15 18 very pissed, mainly English and American that were "doing China" were ushered in by their tour group leader, told to sit at the back and not obstruct toilets. They said they had "seen China by visiting the Great Wall and Xi Shanghai was their last stop". They got vodka get poured into a 2L coke bottle, drunk as much as they could still, ordered more. Tried to steal my lighter several times while sitting at the bar, coz they thought they could, everyone hitting on everyone but no one being at all attractive. Fortunately their seating area was somewhat to the back. Got angry when the 1 hour was up, told they were going somewhere else and there would be more drink, and herded out of the door. It was like watching unruly zoo animals being ushered around. I had never seen anything like it before, even from university pubcrawl days.

The first signal that a handful of pop music's biggest names would be following in Gaga's footsteps in an attempt to connect with "this girl in the middle of the country somewhere crying her eyes out in the field," as she revealed to E! News she had in mind when crafting Joanne, came in May of 2017 when Miley Cyrus debuted "Malibu." Attempting to rebound from setbacks both personal (her 2015 experimental album, Miley Cyrus Her Dead Petz, was a bona fide flop) and political (she'd campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race), Cyrus began crafting an album that her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, told Billboard was "Miley leaning into her roots more than I've ever heard."

A big part of today's e commerce landscape is the affiliate program (also known as associate programs). This area was pioneered by Amazon. Amazon allows anyone to set up a specialty book store. When people buy books from the specialty store, the person who owns the specialty bookstore gets a commission (up to 10 percent of the book's list price) from Amazon. The affiliate program gives Amazon great exposure because it now has over 1,000,000 specialty bookstores all over the Web [ref]. Therefore this model is now copied by thousands of e commerce sites. If you are setting up an e commerce site you will want to consider an affiliate program as one way to get exposure. Link Share is a company that helps e commerce sites set up affiliate programs.

When OLGR assesses individual tax rebates, the audit found that they are "based on minimal evidence" and "there are no procedures in place to provide an objective review".

Yes your situation does sound very similar to mine, so this helps! we actually broke up this past september for about 3 months and we've been back together for about 2 months now. during the breakup was the absolute worst for me, but i learned a lot about myself and when we started talking again we both agreed that we needed the time apart and are better now because of it. Things have been absolutely amazing the past two months, but i did have an episode the night i posted this. My reason for posting is because if it were to happen again, I want to be able to determine if getting back together was the right decision or not and i figure if i had some good ideas to help explain it to him beforehand and it still doesn't work, then I might just do exactly what you have done and try to move on even though that's not at all what i want.

But anyways thanks so much for your help, i'm glad things are good for you now and you've found happiness after going through that for so long!!

With many people treating their pets more like children and less like animals, there is a growing trend of taking them to places that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. A 2009 AP poll showed that half of all American pet owners considered their pet as much a part of the family as any other person (Another 36 percent said the pet was part of the family but not a full member.) Perhaps it's people from the first group who bring Fido along to social events, even when he hasn't been explicitly invited.. 
All domains of life, including bacteria, have what are called "error prone" DNA polymerases. These polymerases are induced during times of stress, such as exposure to low levels of antibiotics. The idea is that by allowing mistakes in replication, there will be a population of cells that develop mutations that make them better suited for this stressful environment. So upon exposure to the lower levels of antibiotic, some cells do indeed develop mutations through this mechanism, allowing them to thrive at the higher concentrations. Of course mutations can arise spontaneously as well, but I don think spontaneous mutation alone could account for the rate at which this population becomes resistant, though I admit I don know for sure.

Except he couldn beat him. He threw everything he had at him and Luffy kept getting back up. He gained a respect for Luffy when he noticed how far Luffy was able to grow during the fight but he certainly didn throw his pride away just so Luffy could escape. Luffy beat Katakuri because Katakuri wasn strong enough to keep someone like Luffy down. Hell at the start of the fight the concept of getting knocked down and back up again was so foreign to Katakuri he couldn even grasp what Luffy was doing. On the other hand Katakuri is someone that never had to get back up from a beating and, unfortunately for his fans, found himself unable to do just that when he recieved one.

The recruitment of both superficial and deep muscles helps to develop strength endurance of all the muscle groups that provide spinal stability. Both types of muscle groups (deep superficial) have similar activity patterns and simultaneous neuromuscular function during dynamic tasks, especially when performed on an unstable platform.

Twitter was searched in a variety of different ways with no luck. Twitter accounts for several show/episode related people (including most of the people on IMDB with potentially relevant roles for this episode and even a few from prior episodes) failed to turn up anything of use whatsoever.

Fight or Flight kicked in and I FLEW out of bed and ran toward the front door screaming "GET OUT OF HERE!!" which came out as complete gibberish as I had been sound asleep about 30 seconds prior and now had crazy adrenaline pumping through my veins.

I have a ridiculously over the top headcanon to compensate for this, given that in the DoTD novelisation, 9 smashed mirrors in an effort to never have to see his own gaze. I can totally see 9 travelling around for hundreds of years refusing to see himself, until finally feeling confident that maybe he saved enough people to make up for the lives he took that day and earned his old life back.

I learned something very interesting related to this when I was younger, but I don know the technical reasons it works.

Keep it closed the entire time the lights are on, then after you turn the lights back off, open the closed eye, and the night vision for that eye will be preserved. I don know why the light in one eye doesn affect the other, I always assumed before I learned this they were connected in the brain. Give this a try if you don believe me!
