Et comme on peut lire tout et son contraire, comment choisit on notre croyance ?

Mr Chin, Hexham Bowling Club secretary manager, said he was at a loss to explain the increase in net profit because many clubs were doing it tough. He said clubs were a vital part of the region's economy, employing thousands and contributing millions in taxes. ''Consumer confidence in our area is pretty low, members are coming and not spending as freely as they used to,'' he said. 
Singapore is another case in point. But here the social engineering is a lot more obvious, and absolutely draconian in some respects. Sexual assaults will land you in jail for a long time with mandatory caning that hurts so bad it splits the skin   they have to limit the number of strokes you can get in one sitting. Murder brings death penalty, no two ways about this.
They lament the dwindling population, but rather than admit that the cost of living and modern work/life balance is killing families, that their attitudes about women working are archaic and that their stance on immigration is xenophobic, they accuse young people of shirking their "national duty" in favour of implied petty selfishness.

While we fret over emails and campaign finances, Russian state TV is telling citizens to locate where the nearest bomb shelter is at. That alone should say something.
Two straight guys saying they are going to "rape" each other in a computer game isn politically incorrect because there a very little chance of the literal act actually taking place; just like two white people saying they are going to lynch one another, it isn politically incorrect. But saying you are going to "rape" a girl in jest is indeed being a misogynist because the vast majority of rape cases over our history as a society have been enacted on woman.

There definitely something wrong with her, amongst other things, I just don see K Kardashian being a great role model!

Odd request for a woman unless. or that they using each other and he letting her think that he a millionaire but again, that a lot of money to for a 26 y old to be spending just to get laid!

Omg, definitely better away from her kids.

The thing is, poorly educated people who don understand or care about nutrition but still eat meat are just as prone to vitamin deficiencies, of different kinds. Eating predominantly cheeseburgers and fries and cereal isn healthy regardless of how much iron or protein you get from the beef.

"At the end of the day, me and the Indonesian guys were comparing our bruises and they saw my foot and were laughing. Then they said 'Massage, massage.' So we loaded up into a van and drove about an hour and a half. We got out of the van and went into what could only be described as a crack den. They bring us in and there's this fat guy with purple sweat pants and a Hard Rock Caf t shirt, smoking cigarettes on a couch. I said 'You guys brought me to the wrong place!' They sit me down in front of the guy and he immediately looks at my foot and grabs it and starts grinding this huge lump in my foot like he's trying to smash it. He basically smashes the bruise out of my foot. All the blood disperses throughout my foot   which obviously is not a sound medical procedure. My foot wound up getting infected from it. Crazy intense pain. I couldn't walk for three weeks."

So said PML (N) whip Sheikh Aftab who is perhaps the most under rated politician in the ruling party. At least half of the government functioning in the Parliament rests on his shoulders and yet he remains a junior minister. He was responding to Javed Hashmi's assertion that he had never aspired to become the prime minister. No sooner had Aftab uttered these golden words than walked in Nawaz Sharif, accompanied by a band of his senior ministers who are habitually absent from Parliament when the prime minister is not around. Aftab's description of the prime minister's life was written large over the face of Nawaz Sharif. Gone were the heady days when he relished his Kashmiri cuisine and could spare time for his music (he once showed journalists Zaffar Abbas, Nusrat Javed, Mohammad Malick and yours truly his collection of music, Geeta Dutt being his favourite). One could notice traces of sleepless nights and troubled days on his face even from the Press Gallery.

When her daughter, a nurse, phoned the endocrinologist, he denied that the patient's breathing problem was related to her lower dose of Armour. He advised her to consult an ear, nose, and throat specialist. She saw a lung specialist instead, and he prescribed 40 mg of cortisone and an inhaler. The inhaler enabled her to get through her days. But even with the help of the inhaler, she couldn't walk up a short flight of stairs without gasping for air. Her voice was so badly affected that she could no longer sing, which she had always enjoyed. could only croak, she said.

I not sure about river because it kind of silly to get to this spot with this hand, but I favor a fold. I think checking AA on the flop is probably not optimal vs the field, but if you do check it should definitely be the combos with the Ac so you can easily snap this off.

Not to mention that anybody with a student loan ought to read what she's been up to in making any and all relief much more difficult to achieve for all of us (all the while outright ignoring the foreboding signs of an impending student loan bubble). When this is all over, Devos will go back to being a vacant headed opportunist. The public will chalk up her decisions not to malfeasance or negligence to criminal levels. she won't go to prison. She won't suffer. She'll enjoy the spoils of her subversion of the greatest right we offer our citizens: the right to better your life. We will be left to clean up another mess with years and years of unknown damage in plenty of unknown sectors. Education affects crime rates. It affects health outcomes. There are far too many consequences for allowing someone with such fucking conflict of interest into such a post. So please, in 2020, learn about the candidates. Register to vote. Become civilly engaged. Because if you don't shoo them away, more birds of fucking carrion like Betsy Devos will hop in and pick the bone clean.

The demonstration in January and February 1838 used the Vail register (accentuated in italics in the JFI report) and did away with the Morse pendulum apparatus for recording the message this was evidently a great improvement. The first "representing numbers" were a series of dots. This is perhaps the first publication in a journal of the dot method of transcribed signals of a recording electromagnetic telegraph. The dots are pictured ". The second, "alphabetical signals are made up by a combination of dots and lines of different lengths"), an example of which is not shown. (I should point out that this article is about half the length of the JFI article.) is surprising is to see what Morse himself had to say on this issue. Here are his notes on the system of notation, from the SFB Morse papers at the Library of Congress, Manuscripts Division, bound volume 28 November 1835 18 April 1838, page 154 ("Drawings to Accompany Copy of Caveat of Oct 6 1837"). The penciled note states "this is old mode of sign and is the only specimen ever published. See the Mechanics Magazine". It was also evidently published in the American Journal of Science and Arts about the same time. There is no reference to the JFI report or the "dots" (or "1st Mode"). It may simply be the case that at the time of his writing this that Morse was simply unaware of the JFI report, as the three appearances were all published at about the same time (within weeks of one another). no expert in this field, but I haven been able to turn out any earlier use of the dots than this report. 168, and then in the Mechanics Magazine (London) for 10 February 1838.

I genuinely wondering what you mean by both sides need to come to a solution. Trump made it clear that he wants wall funding as a response to perceived boarder security issues. Dem have stated that they will fund boarder security, but not a wall. It seems like the Dem are coming to the table with options, Trump is the one that is stuck on a very specific non negotiable item. It feels like the only real solution here is for Dem and Republicans to come to an agreement that they are both happy with and to override Trump veto power. Do you see some other solution that nobody else does?.

I began my response by saying, fear for the future liability of obstetricians. Autism is but one of several alleged harms that obstetricians may hear about when their attorneys call. Gestational vitamin D deficiency is associated with a significantly increased risk of neonatal pneumonia, a doubled risk for preeclampsia, a tripled risk for gestational diabetes, and a quadrupled risk for primary cesarean section. told them that I knew that are already being driven out of practice by malpractice suits. Now a warning from the American Academy of Pediatricians, combined with an article in Scientific American, should worry obstetricians and their attorneys. Medical malpractice claims may be filed for several years after the injury is recognized; only then do the statutes of limitations begin their sad toll. then explained, autism is often first diagnosed when the child is 3 4 years of age, a malpractice claim could arise 4 5 years from today, alleging today obstetrician did not follow the American Academy of Pediatrician advice, was unmindful of the brain damage/vitamin D risk, and did not do a proper risk/benefit assessment. what seemed obvious to me, I wondered if in 2014 may ask themselves what the risk was of diagnosing and treating gestational vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women in 2010. Why did the obstetrician not do it? Such future liability exposure could be lessened if obstetricians would simply follow the American Academy of Pediatrician current guidance to diligently diagnosis and adequately treat vitamin D deficiency in all pregnant patients. ACOG offered not a word of advice to its members or to pregnant women about the need for additional vitamin D during pregnancy.

My neighborhood is basically the opposite of ginger faction (hope i spelled that right. It was a good neighborhood and now its prostitutes, Tweakers , and white trash. A lot of my friends Grand parents have serious cases of meth mouth and the kids in my neighborhood don have good parents, and although Marijuana isnt bad on the fully developed adult brain, it is bad on the brain of a 4 year old.

I am not a professional, but I have had a lot of experience and have given some very sensual massages making sure that every nerve and muscle are taken care of and given special attention. I can travel or host; I do not as of yet own a table, so when I do them at home, I have to use my bed. I have a variety of oils; I have my special ones that I think make the experience a whole lot better, but I have others, also. I tend to use some eroticism during the massage and hitting some of those trigger spots that you might not even know about. I am totally nude; and of course, so are you. I have certain trigger spots that can use special attention from time to time, and I am sure you do too. So contact me for a great, special sensual massage.

As if his previous misadventures in the verbal field were not enough we now have the spectacle of him being trumped by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In Yekaterinburg (Russia) the first thing Singh said to him (in remarks obviously rehearsed beforehand) was, "My mandate is to tell you that Pakistani territory should not be used for terrorism against India." Zardari could have countered with a suitable reply such as that his concern was to see that Indian consulates in Jalalabad and Kandahar were not used as staging posts for subversion against Pakistan. But that would have required other gifts than he has..

As well as being extremely durable, familiarity is hard to fake. This makes the system difficult for fraudsters to crack. In the current study, the researchers asked volunteer attackers to watch a successful authentication sequence based on four target faces, so that they could pick out the same four faces from similar test grids. These attacks could be defeated simply by using different photos of the same faces in the test grids. For the user, who is familiar with the target faces, it is easy to recognize the faces across a range of images. For the attacker, who is unfamiliar with the target faces, generalizing across images is difficult.

The PPP's newly discovered addiction to this mutilated Constitution is not unexpected. Given the personal trials (undeserved), and political tribulations (deserved), that the president has gone through, his affinity for a souped up version of the presidency was entirely predictable. A mutilated Constitution that validates a hyper powerful presidency has meshed perfectly with the deeply insecure model of governance adopted by the president. When presidential spokespersons express indignation at the Kerry Lugar Bill outrage as being a proxy for opposition to the president they are simply living out the structural and contextual reality of the office of president in a Pakistan that is governed by a mutilated Constitution.

About a year ago I was in Reno, NV and playing a tournament at the Peppermill when in the first round the guy in front of me has his hands completely covering his cards and I folded out of turn, which prompted the dealer to call over the tournament director who told me that folding out of turn is "against the rules" here and that I would be getting a hand penalty for the infraction. I no newbie, have at least 100 live MTT under my belt. What. The. Fuck? I never heard of that rule being enforced  the rule isn posted anywhere and it was literally my first orbit ever in that casino. I half thought everyone was joking with me until the dealer dealt me aces the next hand and then told me I was required to fold the hand. The rest of the table was seemingly amused.

In part because of weaker global economic growth, protectionist measures have recently become increasingly commonplace. According to a report by the WTO's Trade Policy Review Body, an average of 22 new trade restrictive measures were initiated by WTO members each month during the mid October 2015 to mid May 2016 review period. "This constitutes a significant increase compared to the previous review period, which recorded an average of 15 measures per month, and is the highest monthly average since 2011," announced the WTO in a statement. Explains Guillen, "There has been a rise in instances of protectionism through anti dumping measures and also through administrative controls or other types of actions that cause delay at the border. I interpret these as attempts by governments to protect without being seen as contravening WTO rules."
And then, when Coney Island Democrat Pamela Harris found out the feds were on to her, she instructed witnesses to lie to investigators, according to an 11 count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn federal court.Prosecutors say Harris, 57, who was arrested Tuesday, accepted $35,000 in City Council discretionary funds for a non profit she ran before taking office   but instead funneled the dough into her personal bank account, before spending the cash on frilly things from Victoria's Secret, paying down the mortgage on her Coney Island home, and dropping $10,000 on vacations with her husband.Harris, who was elected to a two year term in 2016, refused to say whether she would step down as she left Brooklyn federal court Tuesday afternoon.Prosecutors say she forged a lease stating she was renting space for her Coney Island youth non profit Generation Gap, when in reality, she ran the group out of her own Neptune Avenue house and pocketed the funds, an indictment states.She is also accused of stealing nearly $25,000 from a federal program to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy by taking aid meant for displaced storm victims.Despite being able to stay in her Neptune Avenue home, she claimed she was displaced and forged a lease and rent receipts to collect $1,500 a month in federal emergency housing money, the indictment alleges.She also is accused of committing bankruptcy court fraud by hiding $10,000 in investments and lying about her income when she filed for Chapter 13 protection in November 2013, prosecutors say.Harris, elected to the Assembly in 2015, caught wind of the FBI investigation in 2016 and, despite her oath of office, instructed two witnesses to lie to the feds, prosecutors allege."The brazen corruption charged as a result of this investigation tramples on the very definition of a public servant," Department of Investigation Commissioner Mark Peters said in a statement.Political mentor and Coney Island Councilman Mark Treyger   who is not named in the indictment   has directed at least $65,000 in city funds to Harris's non profit since 2014, public records show.Treyger spokesman Aaron Hecht said the allegations are "serious and troubling, and are deeply disappointing if true."The cash came after the council tightened restrictions on discretionary spending in 2014 to tamp down on corruption.If convicted, Harris could face up to 30 years imprisonment for making false statements to FEMA; 20 years each on wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice conspiracy charges; and five years apiece on five other fraud charges, prosecutors said.A friend posted her $150,000 bail, and Judge Ramon Reyes limited her travel to New York City, Long Island and Albany."[Harris] has pleaded not guilty and we look forward to our day in court and an opportunity there to present the full facts," lawyer Joel Cohen said. "Importantly, none of the allegations contained in the indictment relate to Ms. Harris's conduct in office.".

Great sneakers are a must. And I always wear running shorts because they breathe well and are light, shit gets MOIST over the course of a day. Bring a cheap poncho just in case.

P hacking is a broad term that covers a variety of dubious statistical techniques. I recommend reading A Garden of Forking Paths. by Andrew Gelman, which delves into some of the more esoteric methods of "p hacking".
