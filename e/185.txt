It does depend on the context, however   If you're considering the items in the pair individually, use it like a plural subject, but if it's a single entity (pair of scissors, for example), use it like a singular subject.

Two years ago my brother and I wanted to host our own poker tournaments. It really didn't matter if it was Blackjack, Stud, Holdem or any other game, just utilizing this as another way to make money was the main goal.

Of course, maybe cutting it off wasn the crazy part; maybe it was helping the police find it so it could be sewn back on? Maybe we can revive that bumper sticker to say "Lorena Gallo for Surgeon General?". 
You are still in an early enough phase of your relationship that I would suggest you do a really honest evaluation of the character of your man and ask yourself whether you can happily respect and honor him if he were not to change all that much with this issue. If you start out in a pattern of you being more of a leader, because he has more of a passive approach to life, it could be difficult for this to change.

As for the traditional Western gunfight as depicted in movies, the inaccuracy of handguns at the time would have made quick drawing skill irrelevant: It was simply so unlikely you'd hit a guy on the first, second or third shot that it didn't really matter which guy got out his gun first. The closest history got to high noon show downs was dueling, where people just stood across from one another with their guns out, aimed and fired until someone got lucky, and someone else was dead. Forget about "fanning," rapidly cocking a single action revolver between rounds like Clint Eastwood does in A Fistful of Dollars.

Alright, it looks like you have a few things you misunderstanding. they bet 100k, you go all in for 90k, they get their 10k back and 180k will be in the pot. Second, even if your opponents have 10s of millions in their account, only the amount that is on the table can be bet in a single hand, which will likely be the table cap. I took a look at WSOP and it looks like their lowest stake is now 5k/10k, which is kind of unfortunate; I know they used to have much lower stakes. So in that case, you basically be relying on luck to get a decent starting stack. I recommend just sitting down at a table with whatever amount you have, wait until you get dealt AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or AK, then go all in preflop. Hopefully that gets you a few more chips to play with. 10k was variance and 5k was punting. At the time it was over half my bankroll and I was considering quitting and throwing in the towel. Ended up getting back on a stake and played full time for the next 6 months and made it all back plus like 50k by the end of the year. Honestly it was really good for me overall as a player since I had never actually worked hard at poker before then. But seeing that alternate timeline where I give up and get a job at McDonald again become so close to reality was enough to push me. I never let it get that close again that for fucking sure.

We study a simplified version of full street, three player Kuhn poker, in which the weakest card, J, must be checked and/or folded by a player who holds it. The number of nontrivial betting frequencies that must be calculated is thereby reduced from 23 to 11, and all equilibrium solutions can be found analytically. In particular, there are three ranges of values of the pot size, P, for which there are three distinct, coexisting equilibrium solutions. 
However, the TPP 11 preserved many of the reductions in trade barriers and increased market access that the United States helped negotiate.

If you are constantly getting manicures, all the hash chemicals may make the cuticles drier and thinner. It's the same thing with constantly exposing your hands with products like detergents and dish cleaners. All these do damage to the hands and the fingers so make sure to massage with lotion daily, preferably one with Vitamin E. Before you go to bed at night, dab a little on your palm and spread this evenly, including your fingers. You can also purchase cuticle oil at drugstores, beauty stores or the grocery. They only cost less than $2 at most. The oil will help retain moisture to your nails.
It wasn even an "I believe you". I called out the player who folded the Ace, who confirmed and said something to the effect of "sorry about that, I be more careful in the future". The funny part is even if I DIDN see his card I could have pretty safely assumed that it was the Ace of spades as there wasn much else going on the monotone board.

We stonden pas om 8u op, en het was dan ook al na 10u toen we het Rode Plein opwandelden. Op het programma stond het Lenin Mausoleum: het hoekige rode gebouwtje op het Rode Plein waar de voormalige Sovjet leider al sinds 1924 gebalsemd ligt. Het is niet zo heel veel open, vandaar dat het nu op het programma stond. Verdacht dat er bijna geen rij stond, maar toen we niet door mochten van de politie viel roebel dat we vanaf het Man plein moesten aanschuiven. Hier stond wel een lange rij, maar al bij al schoot het goed op. In groepen mochten we door, zak afgeven in de luggage storage, en dan door de metaal detectors. Langs een resem graven ging het naar het mausoleum, waar we in een rijtje de trappen afschuivelden, vlak langs Lenin, en terug naar buiten. Een beetje creepy, maar toch een bijzondere niet te missen ervaring hier in Rusland. Daarna genoten we nog van een koffietje van de gele M langs het water in Alexander park.

Which is why I said it depends on how one distances oneself. Yes, there are unhealthy ways, but there are also healthy ways of distancing oneself. For example, like someone commented on here, one can distance oneself to think over the situation as rationally as one is capable, cooling down, before attempting to better the situation or fixing the issue or whatever the next step is. Distancing oneself does not have to always be an indication of not being able to talk or inability to keep healthy relationships.

No, you two are not at the 4 year mark. Talk to him about this again now, at the 3.5 and 4 year mark. After 4 years is when he may want to get engaged. IMO, after living for someone for 3 years you should know them pretty well by now. He may want to get married but may be really nervous about making it a legal marriage with a marriage license. Men are really gun shy about marriage now because so many women use the divorce laws as a weapon, not a shield, and this has been going on for 40 years.

Its pathetic how westerners, presumably males, who probably never seriously gave 2 shits about feminism or womens rights suddenly get defensive when it comes to "ownership" of feminism, and talk over ACTUAL female feminist scholars in claiming who it revolves around.

This is the work of Etienne Marey (who has made a number of appearances on this blog), a very smart and versatile guy who would go from physiology to cinematography to aerodynamics in the course of his life and be a leader/pioneer in each field. Marey published this "strobophotograph" in his article "Analyse cinematique de la marche" in the Comptes Rendus on 19 May 1884 this was a brilliant effort in the analysis of human locomotion by making a dozen or two exposures on a single photo sheets of a reflective outlined walking figure. This was different from Marey birthyear and deathyear buddy, the other motion picture pioneer, Eadweard Muytbridge (1830 1904 for both). Marey introduced his "chronophotography" and studied aspects of movement and motion that had been dispersed to human history because of the inability to observe and record them with Marey, that issue necessary for the beginning of real scientific discourse was to a large extent solved.

For every move there's a counter. And for every action there's a reaction. Poker takes us on a journey that makes us run scenarios over and over in our own minds   hoping that every decision, every move was the right one. Will we ever know if we got our opponent to fold the best hand? Maybe. Maybe not. But one thing's for sure, they may never know what we held either.
