And then the next day Kim ended up in the hospital. Why? Kyle wasn't sure, but the ladies were shocked. Kim took to her Bravo blog to discuss what happened at Eileen's and her subsequent hospital trip.
And the more unexpected the result, the more skeptical replication to disprove it (and even calls of "Bullshit!") it garners. Just look at when Fleischman and Pons published on "cold fusion". The race to replicate and invalidate their experimental results was swift and relentless. The same is true for the team in Italy a few years back that skeptically published and question their own experimental result that seemed to indicate faster than light signaling.

A question arises: is it too risky to hunter in Poker. Will not you lose more? Will not rake swallow all profits? Here of course much depends on the level of the player. However, at low limits up to $1/$2 (it is no use to trying higher for a hunter and the bank does not allow to risk in this way) the level of the players is not too high, therefore anybody who will spend a couple of hours on studying the chance concept and basic principles of the game and print the table of the start hands, has good chance to become a plus player.

People hate Sarah Palin in a more personal way, because she's pretty and stupid and homey and conservative perhaps, just as people hated Hilary Clinton before Barack put her somewhere safe because she didn't care about pretty, wouldn't bake cookies, and she's smart. Working with that range of hatreds pretty to not pretty, cookies to no cookies, stupid to smart female politicians really don't have as much of a chance to be judged on their ideas. Do they?. 
I have 10 outs, 2 of these outs help my opponent hand/potentially help it, so I do 10 2 and I have 8 outs right?
Decide whether or not it's worth "drawing." Holding out for the cards you need is known as "drawing." If your hand could be successful depending on whether the right cards come up in the turn or river, then you'll have to determine if it's worth holding out for them. Calculating pot odds can help you make this decision.

Along with facility pools, pedicures can also be troublesome. Even the best spas experience challenges keeping their pools and pedicure equipment free of bacteria, so pregnant women are probably better off just skipping these particular spa services for a few months, or at the very least doing a thorough Q with the spa professionals to find out what precautions they take to keep things clean. Get them to clean everything right before you put your feet in, and consider bringing you own tools for them to use.

Each player starts with only two cards and the remaining cards are shared, therefore it is an excellent game for strategic thinkers. In Texas hold 'em, like all variants of poker, players compete for the money in the pot, contributed by the players themselves. Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand the player holds.. 
One summer Friday as hot and sultry as they get, Goldman loaded us interns onto a bus and drove us two hours north of the city to play paintball in the woods outside Newburgh. Several other interns and I made sure to be on the team opposite from the program leader. We literally wanted to take a shot at him. It was the best work day I ever had, moved as we were from the locker room to an actual field for once. I realize I'm taking this metaphor too far, but I was told later that some interns were dismissed from serious long term consideration for not being sufficiently aggressive at paintball. Even today it seems believable.

Plan the menu. Will you be serving appetizers and cake or a full meal? Depending on what time of the day the party will take place, you can keep it simple (appetizers and cake) or go all out and serve a meal to all of the guests. If you opt for the latter idea, shoot for a buffet style spread that requires little last minute preparation.

So the dungeon, rooms, puzzles, monsters, etc are all the same. But the combats get more difficult, and usually more complex. In other words, monsters will have more hit points, higher armor class, more powerful and varied attacks, different tactics, etc. It requires more teamwork, skill, and tokens to play at more difficult levels, but it is essentially the same game as playing as a beginner.

The Supreme Court's order appointing three mediators to find a solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute is quite strange and incongruous, given that all such previous attempts have ended in failure. Further, the case is ripe for final hearing, and not all parties favoured mediation. The dispute over the site at Ayodhya, where a 16th century mosque stood until it was torn down by Hindutva fanatics in December 1992, has remained intractable since 1949.

The potential positive for the poker world at large is because of increased competition in the market. In the last several years, pokerstars has made a number of changes which have increased their bottom line at the expense of players (increasing rake, reducing rewards, increasing rake again, screwing over SNEs, increasing rake some more, etc). They been able to make these changes because they have an effective monopoly in the online poker world, so their attitude towards the player base is basically "screw you guys, we know you have to play on our site no matter what we do, so pay up.".

The reasons we do this are complicated. Partly it is because we are a culture born of a middle class revolution about 100 years ago when the upper classes (and lower classes) were denied power by virtue of middle class discipline. The middle classes, it was claimed, have more work discipline, marital discipline, bodily discipline, and sexual discipline. Therefore the middle classes are more fit to rule (this is probably why 80% of Americans identify as middle class  who wants to be undisciplined?).

There's considerable controversy among triathletes and coaches about exactly what the balance should be between high and low intensity training, especially when it comes to running. Proponents of low intensity workouts contend that running as many miles as possible at a slower pace is most beneficial, while those who support high intensity exercise feel that it's better to run fewer miles at a faster pace. There are valid arguments to support both points of view.

The latest expansion of this ridiculous net is about "sexting"  when consenting teens send naked photos of themselves to each other or post them on their Facebook page. So if you 61, don send photos to your 62 year old lover. And if you 17, do not snap the photo of yourself nude for your 16 year old lover.

In the typical trope of the romance novel, the book New Moon portrays just an ordinary gal, Bella Swan  Kristen Stewart  who is not particularly beautiful (well, she is, but she not supposed to be), not particularly smart, and ALWAYS in need of protection from her preternaturally strong men  the vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob with his abs. The lead romantic male must be strong, but emotionally distant (Edward is so emotionless he always looks slightly constipated in these movies).

A Jackson based charity poker business is in expansion mode. Charity Poker Solutions opened a poker room at Hot Rods, 1715 E. Michigan Ave., in July and opened a new one Monday at the LA Cafe, 4460 W. Maumee St., Adrian. Charity Poker Solutions got in at the beginning of a business boom in Michigan. Casino style charity gambling events are now taking place in more than 120 establishments statewide, said Tom Reich, a director in the Michigan Lottery's Charitable Gaming Division. The trend has upset Michigan casinos, and some legislators now say charity gambling needs tighter rules. State Rep. Tom McMillin, R Rochester Hills, has proposed legislation to limit venues to one, four day charitable gambling event per month. Proponents of charity gambling say such a law would single charity poker games out unfairly. Bingo, for example, is regulated much the same way charity poker is, and no one is proposing tighter rules for bingo. Fuller also pointed out that Charity Poker Solutions is creating jobs and raising money for charities when both are at a premium. "You wouldn't believe the thank yous we get. It's really unbelievable," Fuller said. "When you put it all together in this economic time, it's quite favorable."

His parole officer didn keep up with him and I believe he was already wanted because he hadn registered as a sex offender as he had been ordered to when he kidnapped a little girl, raped her, and buried her alive in a trash bag. His defense claimed he was retarded in order to avoid the death sentence. He sat there coloring throughout the proceedings. He died two years later from cancer. That girl would have been alive today if he had served his full sentences and the justice system had kept tabs on him properly.

Damn! I have an eye story too. So one day there was a sudden windstorm while i was in an open parking lot on the outskirts of a city, a leaf flew right into my eye. And it immediately started to hurt. I somehow drove home and my eye was constantly hurting, i washed it a few times, didn work. I started to feel movement inside my eye but couldn see anything in the mirror. I was convinced i wasn just "seeing things". Then finally my mom took me to an eye surgeon. Went in as an emergency, the doc examined and rushed me to an OR saying i had living micro organisms inside my eye. Took about 20 minutes and they removed all FOURTEEN of them. ALIVE! Got a patch like a pirate that i had to wear for a few days. Doc said he never seen anything like it in his 25 years of experience. Said i was a one in a million case and if i had taken a day to come in, chances were high that i would be blind.

One of the main difference between me and lets say one of the next few best german players is that i have memorized a lot more opening knowledge. But that only gets me to the point where we both don "know" the position any more in a better way. After that my midgame and endgame has still to do a lot and there the main difference is that I have more experience / know more patterns and have a better evaluation for the patterns. Many of the standard things they know as well, so often they make as good moves as I do and sometimes they beat me because the game just happens to have those patterns that they know and are able to evaluate correctly. In other games my experience lets me evaluate the patterns much better and after the games I can really explain very well why, I just have "experience".

What Peterson proposes as a different understanding of truth is not about ignoring scientific facts, but putting the experience of meaning in one life and the subjective truth that results above the scientific dictate. His whole point of Nietzsche whenever he brings him up can be summed up as that, the spiritual understanding of truth (this can also be seen as ethics, or code) has been killed in favor of what are cold, hard and soulless facts.

I never said there wasn a constitutional right to a speedy trial. I saying your expectation that speedy equates to 175 days is incorrect. There no hard number set by the constitution. In Barker v. Wingo, the case that effectively established the concept of the modern speedy trial (and the subsequently passed federal speedy trial act) the Defendant waited 5 years for a trial and the Supreme Court held it wasn a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. When a defendant claims a violation, the court applies a balancing test, assessing the length of the delay, the reason for it, whether the defendant asserted the speedy trial right, and whether the wait compromised the defense. It doesn just result in dismissal of the charges.

L'embryon doit tre rang dans la catgorie des choses, comme le souligne l'utilisation par le Tribunal administratif d'Amiens, dans sa dcision du 9 mars 2004, de la terminologie  matriel .

De son ct, le TA exclut aussi la qualification d'tre  l'embryon congel.

A suggestion for memorializing his birthday: we lost a baby, and I think my kids are too young to really remember/get it, so what we do is have a cake and candles on baby brother's birthday.

It's a small thing that I hope will help them associate their baby brother in a positive fashion some day in the future.

They largely copied Forerunner designs they stumbled upon and because of their religious attachment, wouldn improve or innovate with them. At one point, some Spartans take control of a Covenant frigate and Cortana uses it to obliterate several other equivalent covenant frigates because the weapon and shield systems were so under optimized she could immediately improve performance several times over just by tweaking some things.So yeah ultimately Humanity was on the better trajectory because they were aggressively innovating and developing on everything they had, though their survival at Earth was largely because the Covenant Civil War gave them the breathing room to seize the initiative.JerikTelorian  23 points  submitted 5 months agoThis is fairly common, historically.

She is probably feeling lucky as hell to have found you (since no other guy would likely tolerate even a fraction of what you have) and when she knows she's about to lose you, there may be no limits to what she says or does to keep you around.

We also accepted Coca Cola's invitation to visit Mexico, which accounted for about 11 per cent of the company's global sales back in 2012. At that time, the average Mexican consumer was buying 160 litres of soft drinks per annum, compared to just below 30 litres in Vietnam. Coca Cola wanted us to see Vietnam's potential and to share their dream. We came away more convinced than ever about Vietnam's.

Whatever lies you tell yourself about why you can stop are just that , lies.

Put simply, the larger the game space, the further we are from beating the game. By game space I mean number of possible game states.

Yeah I guess there really isn anything that bests a space laser (the courier also gets one in the form of Helios 1, I believe) or an orbital nuclear satellite. But regarding armies, the ending of Tactics sees the Warrior taking over a pre war robot controlling a vault named the Calculator and gaining access to the facilities it used to churn out a robot army. As huge as what the Courier forces are, they are finite and limited to what in the secret bunker. The Calculator (and by extension, the Warrior) can make more manufacturing plants and just keep making more robots. Not only that, but unlike most other branches of the BoS, the Midwest chapter allows recruits from tribals, bolstering their numbers further. One on one, a knight or a humanoid robot may lose to an upgraded securitron but the Courier men just can keep up with the numbers the Warrior can pump out.

We should always target the State rather than pretending that the sole institution permitted the unquestioned use of force against everyone, is the same institution that will make life better for everyone.

Nice work on your first song! I agree with Fucking Glorious, personal experience always evokes more emotion and imagery than general statements. Most people will infer what going on or what happened based on the context. Also, don be afraid to NOT rhyme at the end of every phrase. Sometimes forcing the rhyme feels obvious and/or makes it easy to not think twice about the line just because you "solved" for the rhyme. Keep it up, you will only get better from here.
I add to that a little more and say an additional challenge is that the administration team is more and more difficult to reach, so we left to either moderate off of our gut which could be hit or miss and have weak backup, or leave things be until they eventually get back to confirm information for us.

They have a right to exist, sure, but they are nothing but pure spin and should be treated with the same journalistic respect as say, a high school newspaper or the comments section of a youtube video. Alex Jones has a right to free speech but he also does not have the same protections as legitimate news organizations.. 
Sometimes tears of joy, sadness, grief, etc come through and sometimes not. The lack of tears are not a sign that emotional healing has not occurred..

There is something specific to adversity and having to adapt to living in a world not inherently "user friendly" that manifests individuals who don accept "No" or "Can as answers if a door is closed to them.

Duke next turns to assessing outcomes after the fact, through "outcome fielding." Was an outcome driven by luck or skill? Duke offers guidance: Focus on objectivity and seeking out the truth, avoid extremes, preserve a positive self narrative, and use a betting context to shift the psychology. She highlights an anecdote about poker superstar Phil Ivey, who obsessively deconstructed his play after winning a tournament instead of basking in glory.

Consistency is key! Use an erg score calculator to help you find the split you need to maintain then find that split within the first ten strokes and HOLD IT. You're going to have a lot of adrenaline coursing through you in the first 500 and your body is going to want to go harder but you must resist the urge. You and your coach can decide when you want to start your sprint at the end but I suggest you start when you have 300 m to go. Then you EMPTY YOUR TANK. I did a lot of research on the best method for a 2k and this plan worked really well for me. I PB'd with this method. The other good thing to do is practice your race plan. Do several practice 2ks with your method of choice so you know what to expect mentally on race day. You can probably get some soups down to $1/serving. Just google recipes until you find ones that you like. Buy bullion instead of liquid stock to save money. Two very cheap and very nutritious ingredients are lentils and spinach. Buy NON PACKAGED spinach though as it's much cheaper. Just buy the fresh bunch for about $1. Wash it thoroughly as spinach is grown in sand and it's gritty. Add it to literally everything you eat for extra nutrition. Probably the cheapest protein you can get is canned tuna. One of my favourite cheap meals is tuna quesadilla with miso soup. Good luck!
I get where you coming from, and it debatable whether or not it should have been a paid expansion. I personally think there was enough content in the base game and at a high enough polish level that it was worth full price at launch. But I can see how some would disagree.

In household conditions and even in a greenhouse, seeds started too soon can become tall and leggy. Most seed catalogues give an approximate date for seeding each variety, and their recommendations are accurate. Balance this with early or late weather patterns, which can vary up to three weeks. 
Contrary to common belief, games like blackjack, roulette and craps aren't actually the biggest moneymakers for casinos, so it's unlikely they'll will give free rooms to anyone who plays moderately at these tables.

Can definitely see how this attitude could be scored as less conscientious. But in a deeper sense, I think it just indicates that my values diverged from those being measured by things like a Big Five Personality Test. A holistic understanding of compassion can be fairly subtle, and measures of workplace "performance" are often pretty crude.

El cansancio es uno de los principales enemigos del jugador de poker. Si en la disputa de una partida te comienzas a sentir casando es probable que debas optar por retirarte puesto que tus reacciones son ms lentas que en otras oportunidades y tus decisiones no son tan acertadas.

TIL that scientists can remote control rats by implanting electrodes in their brains, such that they get a rush of pleasure when they obey sent commands. Scientists can make them turn left or right, even climb objects. They are not forced to obey, they just want to because of the pleasure reward. What solace would you seek for emotional pain? Still certain?
Of course I can't say for sure what my experience would have been, had my only foreign language been German, since I had already started learning both English and Danish when I started learning German. 
Asking the president to STFU is not censoring him in any way, and the only way to make it so is to expand the definition of censorship to be ludicrously broad that any pastor would be censoring me for not letting me stand up and recite the names of the first 151 Pokmon in the middle of church. Even in Glass, you mainly see him sitting down or on the ground. When his character fights people, it happens off screen (first scene, knockout game teens) or in wides so it might be a double. 
I used to, but the fizziness makes me cough, and once the coughing made me inhale the beverage when it came back up, and I legit almost died trying not to choke and drown at the same time. I know that sounds dramatic, but that what happened. 
Also, theres a condition called Anorexia Mirabilis which can be seen in ancient texts (it can still happen nowadays but it likely better diagnosed and treated) where people would religiously fast to death for the "spiritual benefits". To be very clear, occasional religious fasting is fine. But with AM it would become a disease where, like Anorexia Nervosa, food becomes an enemy capable of making you unclean or unworthy, and starvation becomes the cleanest, "most holy" state.

These are the things that should be made part of schools and colleges where it becomes a moral obligation of these organizations to help spread awareness on substance abuse. Instead of that strategy, taking up a more humane, rational, and scientific approach will work here.

Trying to think of other stuff. Maybe starting Berry and Paige together in 2016 when everyone seemed to think it was going to be Pinson and Paige going into that season. That advanced Berry progression, imo, and led to what he was in 2017. Or starting Paige as a freshman did the same. But we kind of had to do that when Marshall left anyway. Losing to Penn St. is still a Quadrant A/B loss so it isn TERRIBLE. Let not forget Kentucky lost to Seton Hall and Alabama. I have Michigan slightly ahead of Kentucky because I rank on overall resume, and try not to be reactionary. I got Buffalo behind those two teams because 2/3 of Buffalo losses are awful, and Wofford doesn have any bad losses and Cincinnati only has one. Both Cincinnati and Wofford have beaten their slightly weaker schedules by a larger percentage.

What the OP is saying is that switching around these tactics would have been like switching deck chairs on the titanic, given what they were up against with the rampant corruption. A lot of people see JB and DS and their "road show" making tons of money. What I see is even after Steve fires them, and attempts the "ineffectiveness of council" angle, they still are advocating for him and against the system that failed him. How else would it change if JB and DS just high fived, said oh well we tried, and went on about their daily lives. And further more, if so many people were against it, why were so many showing up to see what they had to say?
So, in essence, a novice could sit down at a table and begin to play. Which is not to say they will do very well! A common saying with poker is "5 minutes to learn, a lifetime to master"..

The films never supported the idea that they had these "chips"   Order 66 was something they all knew about, but not when it would go into affect.

I'm going to outright disagree with this for the mere fact that homogeneous groups/society are not representative of culture here in most Western Countries.

I did like 5 hits planning to go to the park with some friends. The plans fell through and my then roommate was being pissy so I shut myself in my room and put on some music. I was fine until I got up to pee. I suddenly realized I was way too high for the situation. My reflection in the bathroom mirror was all wrong in some unsettling way that I couldn quite place. By the time I got back to my room words stopped making sense. Music was disjointed from reality. I decided to play a video game to ground myself   focus on one thing to take control and ride the wave. I sunk myself into GTA V for the next eight or so hours before falling asleep.

Increased enzymatic degradation and cell death was also reported.Another study published also by Holm, PhD and Nachemson, MD (5) found that if dogs exercised a half hour a day for a period of three months, their discs exhibited increased synthesis of proteoglycans, increased transport rate of large molecules into the disc matrix, increased uptake of glucose, oxygen and glycogen, and increased aerobic metabolism.Overall, these findings indicated that spine should be subjected to adequate motion and exercise to ensure adequate supply to the joints and discs. Prolonged bed rest and/ or traction has a proven deleterious effect. With its accompanying fluid flow and variations in creep deformation, were necessary to preserve the nutritional status of discs and joints.These studies are consistent with a larger body of evidence that has evaluated the clinical effects of bed rest and immobility, both of which have been universally and thoroughly discredited as effective methods of treatment for both back and neck problems.Waddell, MD noted in 1987 (6) that there is a loss of 3% muscle strength per day with complete bed rest.The 1994 AHCPR guidelines on Acute Low Back Problems in Adults (7) warned about the potential complications of bed rest including a 1.0% to 1.5% loss of l muscle mass per day, as well as a 15% loss of aerobic capacity in 10 days.The very recently revised and released 1996 British guidelines (8) summarize the literature on bed rest, noting that there are now 9 randomized controlled studies on bed rest, and their findings confirm that bed rest is counter productive.Similarly, the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash Associated Disorders (9) confirmed that prolonged use of cervical collars probably prolongs disability.Today it is understood that motion plays a critical role in maintaining tissue and joint lubrication/nutrition for both discs and joint articular cartilage.We know that articular cartilage receives its nutrition through the circulation of synovial fluid, which is a filtrate derived from blood vessels within the synovial membrane.In addition, the synovial membrane also contains lymphatic ducts, which provide the pathway for the removal of waste products out of the synovial fluid and the joint space.What is essential to recognize is that the synovial fluid has absolutely no inherent capacity to circulate is no heart forcefully pumping synovial fluid to the joints.

They were elevated to being heads of state, generals, scientists of a caliber unmatched by their contemporaries.of this, they would by virtue of increased intelligence be acutely aware of their superiority. For some time, they led armies and nations out of a sense of duty and magnanimity, I like to think. For the betterment of all, they resolved conflicts as deftly as they were able.

Yes, they do. You can see the resulting advertisements in the sidebar, and as sponsored posts. There's no behind the scenes nefariousness taking place, though.

Jim only came a few times but always seemed almost reckless in the way he moved about the horror movie buildings like he was doing a walkthrough with a realtor. He see a closed door, and open it up and walk right into the middle of the room. If you ever been exploring abandoned creepy ass buildings, you know that you tend to creep about kind of slow, peeking around corners and through cracked doors before moving on. Jim just moved around like he belonged there, which he really did everywhere we went. Not with a swagger, just comfort and confidence.

Well, that and suppressing slave rebellions, which was a major concern in the southern states. There a lot of contemporary evidence that the northern states tended to neglect their militias, but the southern states maintained a high state of readiness.

Think of it as acknowledging humans have different characters.Despite that, how (if the concepts were true) would that be useful?If you know what traits are selected for in positive social encounters you can cultivate them. If you know what unattractive you can minimize it.Don you think it possible they were exaggerating aspects of the commentary to make it seem like they had a clear vision?It possible but I see absolutely no reason to think that over the simpler explanation.

Why would they make it seem like they weren faking it?but you looking through rose tinted glasses.You have no evidence of this; so far, the only counters to my arguments anyone has had had are "nuh uh" and "maybe Valve part of an ongoing conspiracy to trick you".

Another thing that I value in Pandunia is that it is complete in itself. It doesn anything from the outside. A good example is the word demokratia, which obviosly means democracy.

With the workloads and expectations put upon the people in those roles, it all but impossible for them to actually have the experience, mental space or ability to do anything that the position description really, honestly, demands.
