Sorry that I respond the way I did, I don know you guys personally so I have no way of really knowing your situation. Hope you can understand my way of thinking though.
The "r" might have been added to throw off players who were wise to the underworld slang. The reason Poker has such seedy origins has mainly to do with the fact that it is a simple game (sometimes even a quick game, depending on the version you're playing), it involves an element of cheating, and it's played for money.

Cats cough just like we do, and for many of the same reasons. Coughing is a reflex; when something irritates the back of the throat, breathing passages or lungs, the body responds, expelling whatever is causing the irritation. It's an important mechanism for protecting the lungs and air passages from foreign objects and expelling infectious matter from the body. Just like us, cats have different kinds of coughs: a dry, hacking cough; a moist sounding cough; a single, gagging cough; a wheezing cough; and that half cough, half clearing the throat thing.

I live in a corner unit with super thin walls. Neighbor on one side is an obese dude who works nights, but apparently forgets that fact every night as about the time I going to bed I hear the loud thunk of his recliner being put down and him stomping around his apartment for two minutes before he slams his door on the way out. The lady on the other side of me cackles instead of laughs and recently got a new sound system that faces our shared wall. All evening and every weekend from the moment she walks in the door till she goes to bed I can hear her shitty tasty in TV and movies. The guy above me heel strikes instead of walks, constantly paces around his apartment and by the sounds of it has started taking line dance lessons. My family has no clue. It helps that I live a few hours away and I talk to my parents once a week, max.

You want to go a bit lighter of a shade, as it will darken over the first few months of its life, plus the rest of the car has at least some of the clear coat left so even something that a perfect match, but doesn have the clear coat, ends up looking darker than the rest of the car..

I think the biggest weakness of the StarViper is the lack of a evade action (and the high cost of the ship of course). Getting a free evade has made the Defender a terror on the table, and while I dislike copying fixes from other ships, something similar should help the StarViper.

And from their perspective they did not think they needed to. They had already run rings around the local joint venture partners the government had forced them to hook up with when they re entered Vietnam in the 1990s.

No wonder Mrs. Kent stole all that money for her wedding. she would not have been worthy of a happily ever after. although her crimes cost her a couple of years of her life, her whiteness and therefore supposedly virtuous motherhood protected her as well. is impossible to imagine a judge taking pity on a non white bride who stole a small fortune for her wedding. a woman would not be a "mum" but a bridezilla, an intruder on the sacred whiteness that is the bride. would also not be a mum who was needed around her kids, but a bad mother, a threat to her young, since perfect motherhood, like the perfect bride, is also always about the role of white femininity in shoring up white privilege more generally.

The Two Faces of Dr Jekyll (1960)DirectorTerence FisherStudioHammer Film ProductionsPlotDr Jekyll is obsessed with his work, ignoring his wife and not realising she has become his disreputable friend Paul's mistress. The film's main flaw is that the lead, Paul Massie, isn't strong enough an actor to convincingly play both Jekyll and Hyde, a fact made apparent when he is surrounded by actors of such calibre as Christopher Lee (possibly the definitive Dracula) and Oliver Reed in an early, uncredited film role. Oliver Reed so impressed director Terence Fisher that he was cast in increasingly larger roles in Fisher's next films, Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960) and The Curse of the Werewolf (1961), launching his career that led to international stardom. 
Man In Beige Stabbins was also doing well, despite insisting on his run up. At least the doors stayed shut this year! The threat of any player (home or away) hitting six and under would be "gelled" seemed to affect the home team more as they struggled to find any sort of score. Skipper Hake came good on the fifth hand with a spare, although how he did it nobody knew as he seemed to be on auto pilot! At least the home spectators at the back were treated to Tony's arse cleavage show!!

If you look at characters that do the same thing like Bowser or Ganon, Bowser's Side B is a straight up suicide where all you need to do is command grab the opponent. If you miss the grab, you just leave yourself open to get hit. Ganon is essentially the same thing as Boswer, but you do it at the ledge where you can just grab the ledge again. 
I would have been there to say goodbye. 
There is no explanation for why things are happening, just that they are and the characters have to deal with it.

The game is a turn based strategy based off of their original game, Runescape (which is great itself). The reason why this game is so good is it has a very appealing range of combat strategy and most of the time players start on a level ground. The best part is that the strategy can get intense very quickly and planning your next moves becomes extremely exciting, turn after turn! If you go try it out, make sure to complete the tutorial before heading into the multiplayer lobby, it's really worth the learning experience and prevents headaches early on in versus play.

I don't have the answers as to how we stop it, but based on history simply "demonizing" or banning does nothing.

Think about the training time for a human. Babies are born, they absorb their surroundings, cultures, languages, maybe 10 years until they are somewhat proficient. The expectation is that by the end of those 10 years, what they learned will be a useful foundation upon which to build their increasing understanding of the world. But. in this new world, by the time they are 11, the world looks very different than it did during the 10 years that they were they are unprepared. Even if they could spend another 10 years re training, they would still be behind, they can never keep up. The computers don need to improve to perfection in a matter of minutes, they just have to improve faster than humans.

We didn't want to lose our town pass for the next day, but we ended up sending runners for help.

Nah. There was some of that in the background but in the foreground the respective empires were pursuing their own interests and using the cold war as justification. I let (Wikipedia explain). Foreign Policy, 1945 1954 (1972) has also received considerable attention in the historiography on the Cold War. The Kolkos argued American policy was both reflexively anticommunist and counterrevolutionary. The United States was fighting not necessarily Soviet influence, but also any form of challenge to the American economic and political prerogatives through covert or military means. In this sense, the Cold War is less a story of rivalry between two blocs, but more a story of the ways by which the dominant states within each bloc controlled and disciplined their own populations and clients and about who supported and stood to benefit from increased arms production and political anxiety over a perceived external enemy.
