Diseases are changing the chemistry of a person, and it isn that hard to believe that certain altered chemical processes might end up producing some compounds that have a unique scent.

Why not approval voting then? The problem with proportional system is that we don actually get to hear which candidates the voters are OK with voting for in general election. We give every person exactly one choice, and this system favors less electable more niche candidates.

The MGM. Of all the low stakes rooms it is the best run. The staff is friendly and while there might be a wait it always moves pretty quickly. I live in Vegas, and have played in most every room on the strip, and always end up back at the MGM. As far as the rake goes, it will be the same at all casinos for some of the games, but when you get into the 2 5 NL games the MGM also has the best rake. If I remember correctly the Mirage is second best, and the Venetian was the worst. Concerning the Luxor, I would stay away. Although they do have really low stakes, it is not the best room. The Excalibur recently downsized, but I believe the game selection is still the same. The staff at the Excalibur has always been helpful, but it is not the greatest casino, and the room is much smaller now. The MGM wins for all around best experience.

The alternative to generic poker felt top is going to be the kind of felt known as speed cloth. Speed cloth is specifically designed to be smoother and more durable over an extended period of time, and when you play on professional poker tables, this is the felt that is used. Take a moment to consider how you want to invest your money. Speed cloth is the more professional option by far, and many people who love the feel of the game as much as they love the action find that they would want nothing else on their tables.

There are many more elements worth considering. Within a few months, the British 14th Army had gone from fighting in jungles to mechanized, combined arms warfare, to urban warfare. Just the idea of combined arms warfare in the Pacific theatre might seem like a strange concept to those familiar with the island hopping campaigns, but in depth study of the Burma campaign 1945 truly shows a serious understanding of modern conventional warfare as it was in the mid 1940s. In terms of deception, which involved everything from attaching the 19th Division that belonged to 4 Corps to 33 Corps to hide the 4 Corps, to fake radio traffic and superiority in the air to prevent Japanese reconnaissance planes from seeing them, it was truly an imaginative strategy that truly has been overlooked. Lastly, and this is always important when talking about military campaigns, Slim could count on the great logistic abilities of his quartermasters and engineers who were able to build airfields on the move so as to supply these two large corps while they marched towards the Irrawaddy. The corps were predominantly supplied either from the air or from the rivers, with improvised rafts and repaired boats serving as vessels to carry supplies.

Well, it usually easier when you initiate the breakup but when I broke up with my ex he prevented any doubts I would have had. I got at least 300 calls from him and a few thousand text messages that ranged from sad and apologetic to angry and threatening. The next day I decided to go hiking with a friend to get away from the stress and didn look at my phone all day until my mother called and asked if I needed to get a ride because he was out looking for me. Apparently he showed up at my house and after I wasn there he went out to the woods to find me. I was terrified. He then got any mutual friends we had to "reason" with me. This is after he has been angry, controlling and isolating for over a year. I tried to end it numerous times but he would threaten to hurt himself. He would take my phone and read my messages and get angry if I talked to anyone without his knowledge. He didn let me spend time with anyone else and even got mad when I went out with my sisters. If I said something he didn like he would snap at me and then be irritable for days. He didn like me wearing certain clothes because I "looked too good in them". He isolated me from my friends and family and made me scared and miserable all the time. And then I became the bad guy when I had the courage to get away from him. When he found out I was seeing someone new, he sent me this message:

One particular instance, they were doing some of the typical "plz kiss/eyefuck/simulate sex" requests (they did the more tame ones and shot down the more overly sexual ones) most BL/slash couple cosplayers got but once a girl in the crowd realized he was trans (his cosplay involved an open shirt and he thinks she must have noticed his top surgery scars) the questions and "requests" got a LOT more invasive and gross. It sounds like it was a case of a couple weeb BL fangirls who had literally no sense of not acting inappropriate in public and they didn actually mean any harm but the overt sexual fetishization of him being trans started like a microsecond after she had her lightbulb "oh you trans" moment and decided that it turned her on that he was trans and his boyfriend was cis (well she assumed anyway and was right in that case but it not like he couldn have been trans as well lol), and her friends to some extent got in on the inappropriate questioning and requests too..

If convicted, the 11 men named in the indictment face possible prison time and huge fines.As a result of this latest scandal, the share prices of competing poker sites, which have already turned down business from US players, have experienced a significant jump.'Elaborate' fraudProsecutors accuse the companies and alleged co conspirators of concocting dozens of fake corporations   purportedly selling items such as clothing, golf clubs and pet food   to collect money from US players.Prosecutors say they managed to persuade several small local banks that were facing financial difficulties to process poker related transactions, by promising fees and fresh investment cash.In one case, the indictment says, PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker took a 30% stake in a Utah bank, SunFirst, and used it to process $200m (123m) in poker funds.

This is from their website as the job description for account manager. It wasn even in the careers section, but a section that should have been devoted to explaining services provided by the company. I can tell you now, this is a sales job. A door to door sales job. Likely it is fully commission, which is why they focus their efforts more on hiring people than attracting business. They are not invested in their employees. It not exactly a scam because some people do well in sales, but I personally do not like these kinds of businesses because they will say anything to avoid admitting that they are nothing but salespeople. I would recommend you do not go. If you want this kind of sales job you can find one in any city.

5) Time. It takes time and patience to grow your hair back out. It took my 2.5 years to get where I want to be. My hair is now long and thick like it was in high school.

Whenever /u/GallowBoob posts something   regardless of where he does it   quite a few people descend to make unfounded accusations about him. Many of these spurious claims could utterly ruin a person's life if they were taken seriously, and the vast majority of them go against one rule or another in the subreddits where they take place. Then, when the comments get removed, the users who posted them get up in arms about it, throwing out accusations that the moderators are somehow being threatened or bribed to side with their sworn enemy.

Further research has found that the pathways used by pain impulses excite not only the areas of the brain that experience physical sensation, but also those associated with emotion and cognition [source: Chapman]. Pain is not only a physical experience; the association of cognition   higher awareness   and emotion attach meaning to the experience of pain. These additional features of pain appear to help humans create more refined memories of a painful experience, which may help keep the person from repeating it in the future [source: Ackerman]..

This article contains information that will help you to deal with Xbox 360 freezing problems, and help you to repair any problems caused by the overheating. First, however, it's important to dispel a harmful suggestion that many gamers have fallen prey to; wrapping their Xbox 360 in a large towel to fix the problem. This is a terrible idea, and can cause your problem to worsen. In fact, it may damage your system to such an extent that you may lose any opportunity to fix it yourself, and will require Microsoft to repair it. Most of the overheating problems can be fixed using simple tweaks of components. I strongly recommend that before you begin tweaking things, you learn which ones should be tweaked and which ones should not. Get yourself a good repair guide. There are a number of excellent ones available from the Internet. The steps described below indicate the complexity of making repairs to eliminate the Xbox 360 freezing problems, but is not a comprehensive guide. Refer to your repair guide for exact procedures.

Surely 7 hours at school socialising with the same age vs 9 hours at home socialising with +/  ages would kind of make this statement redundant? Your statement mostly appeals to the social impact of age mixed classes, implying that maintaining same age classes helps social development however, social periods (breaks and lunches) are completely varied in ages, particularly in secondary school boasting a huge age leap from 12 to 16 year olds.

Yes other countries and cultures have done this.

 104 points  submitted 3 days agoBrutus came from the Corgi and Dachshund Rescue in Wyoming. He was badly abused as a puppy, and he still has anxiety but he's worth every anxious moment. We pulled Barry from a county shelter in a small town called Collierville in Tennessee. We drove from Florida to Tennessee after work one night to be there the moment the shelter opened the next day, and we were able to pull him. I talked to the shelter's director a few days prior, and she was willing to hold on to him until we got there. She wanted him to go to someone that had experience with corgis. I'm still not sure how anyone could give up such a great little guy to a shelter. He's the best friend anyone could ask for. Barry is currently sitting on the couch next to me, and he never leaves my side.You just need to keep your eyes and ears open. Corgis rarely show up in shelters, and when they do, the staff will usually try to give them to a corgi rescue or an experienced corgi owner. So, it's best to reach out to corgi rescues in your area and get on their waiting list. Some rescues go out to puppy mills and talk the owners into surrendering their corgis and whatever litter they may have. Keep an eye on Craigslist in your area, too. You'd be surprised what pops up. I've driven to Atlanta and back just to grab a corgi that popped up on Craigslist. She was 6 and the owners decided they couldn't keep her anymore. she was previously an "outdoor dog," and I've never seen a pupper so happy to rub her body all over a couch.

I was speculating last night about how the human consciousness on one hand is getting more and more connected with the spread of the internet but at the same time I feel the internet and millions of sources of "education" means that essentially the reallity bubble/tunnle that we are all living in is getting more and more unique (and lonely) as we are less and less able to interact with eachother on day to day basis because of technology. I can help but think that a family sitting down at dinner not talking because of cellphones and overworked parents and disconnected children is a perfect recepie for a Sweet big brother control scheme where there the grownups are worker bees and the children are initates into a deeper worker bee system.

These people had their identities stolen and sold to a hostile foreign power who then used their identities to manipulate them into voting for a puppet administration.

I started Dragon Pearl by Yoon Ha Lee. I loved his Machineries of Empire series and was excited to see what was next. This is about a young girl in a futuristic empire who leaves home to search for her brother, a young recruit for the fleet who has gone a wall. Her whole family are fox spirits who have magic, choose their gender, and are mistrusted by everyone else. Although it seems like a very nice story that I'm sure I would have liked when I was young, the plotting and pacing are too middle grade for me to get into so I did not finish. I'm looking forward to Lee's next adult book whenever that is.

I would argue it was the prefect play. As you stated, we started each set of downs with a run, leading to a whole 1 yard gain the set of downs before. The Pats were probably expecting another run here, which means a pass play would be a great call. Not sure why that play should be questioned, as it still would have burned the clock with a completion and getting tackled inbounds. Again, we need a touchdown here for a better chance of winning. I would take a 20 yard gain that burns clock over a yard or two any day.

The game is Texas Hold 'Em No Limit poker, and films such as Rounders, the 1998 Matt Damon drama, along with Moneymaker and the explosion in online gaming, are credited with bringing it into the mainstream and out of the smoke filled back rooms of gangsterdom and the gambling demi monde. It is now perfectly respectable to be a professional poker player and perhaps 20% of the 427 entries at Aspers for the guaranteed 400,000 guaranteed prize pool on the weekend I was there would earn a living that way. The rest, myself included, were a mixture of recreational and online players   the "dead money" to the pros   but the beauty of tournament poker is that there is always a chance that, with a steady nerve and a run of luck, you can stay in long enough to take home a pay out.

People like to call it mutilation because it gives them a reason to then comment on other peoples junk, which in every sense of the scenario, is certainly none of their business. Alas, redditors are obsessed with dicks. However, if you remove the incentive to comment on peoples dick you realize that it isn mutilation at all. Why? because it doesn effect performance or feel.

So for someone to call it mutilation, they are simply ignorant of the facts.

The GOP on the other hand has the opposite issue. Their supporters are fairly consistent, at least when compared with their opposition. They are often elderly, middle class, rural or suburban, and generally want a smaller government presence in their own lives (they fall for the "branding" of the GOP). The GOP itself, however, is a mess as you described.

This past November, experts with the Energy and National Security Program at the Washington based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), described the EU Russia gas relationship as a "partnership of necessity." In a CSIS analysis, they suggested that, rather than confronting each other, Europe and Russia "should engage in a dialogue in order to re negotiate more flexible pricing and other contractual terms," while coordinating on issues like infrastructure and supply logistics and adapting to a rapidly evolving energy market. But it appears any such efforts at cooperation and compromise are far off, at best. At their annual investors' meeting in London on Monday, officials from the Russian gas giant Gazprom said they expect the company's market share in Europe to increase in the upcoming years..

My armpits are darker than the rest of my body because of my deodorant and I don't really know what to do about because I'm not sure if it's deodorant stuck to my skin or the deodorant staining my skin. Even though I do wash them every day, it's still not enough to either dislodge deodorant or remove deodorant stains. However I really don't wanna change deodorants because my armpits are super sensitive and I sweat/smell a lot so it's difficult to find deodorants that cover both needs. I'm just so frustrated :(
However, squamous cells also occur in the lining of the digestive tract, lungs, and other areas of the body.Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are the sixth most common cancer worldwide and are difficult and very expensive to treat.In the experiments, the scientists grew cell cultures in the lab from several different cells lines to which they added fatty acids.The cell lines included both malignant oral and skin SCCs, along with pre malignant cells and normal skin and oral cells.Professor Kenneth Parkinson, Head of the Oral Cancer Research Group at Queen Mary Institute of Dentistry, said:found that the omega 3 fatty acid selectively inhibited the growth of the malignant and pre malignant cells at doses which did not affect the normal cells.we discovered this was partly due to an over stimulation of a key growth factor (epidermal growth factor) which triggered cell death. This is a novel mechanism of action of these fatty acids.

Stores are bleak and depressing and they insult their customers with their stupid BOGO offers by obviously marking up the price of the initial item to cover the cost of the second and then pretending it a sale and that their customers apparently never shop anywhere else and don know the average price for that item.

The boys' search for their missing father was presented by the Supernatural advertising campaigns as the main plot of the show, a parallel, presumably, to Mulder's search for his sister in the X Files.

After a grueling final table that lasted 14 1/2 hours, Las Vegas poker pro Freddy Deeb emerged as the second HORSE world champion, beating 147 other players to win the 2007 tournament. Because of a change in the payout structure, Deeb's top prize of nearly $2.3 million remains the largest awarded in the short history of the event. ESPN cameras caught Nguyen behaving erratically at the final table, swearing and berating his fellow players. It's up for debate whether Nguyen was legitimately out of control or engaging in a particularly intense brand of gamesmanship. Regardless, he later issued a public apology for his actions. Though a popular YouTube video featuring clips from the final table is titled "Scotty Nguyen Belligerent Drunk Montage," Nguyen denied he was drinking to excess.

You can learn the syntax to make queries pretty quickly, the trick is when you need to "join" information from multiple tables. If you make a mistake, you won always get an error message, sometimes you will get nonsense, or just nothing at all.

Again, if the situation were reversed and straight couples were denied visitation rights, most people would see that things need to change. there is something else to this story too: what about people who aren in couples but have intimate and even sexual relationships with people who are not their spouses? They too will be allowed to choose who visits them in the hospital by choosing a "circle of intimates." that a good thing. who are same sex have been discriminated against, but they don deserve the right to be near sick loved ones by virtue of their coupling anymore than the Kings deserve their rights and privileges by virtue of being wealthy, white and straight. ought to be allowed to decide who they want in the room when they die  regardless of marital status, reproductive practices, or any other measure of prestige. is a human right.

Optimal decision making abilities are crucial for success in sporting competition (Bar Eli et al., 2011; Kaya, 2014). Moreover, for the elite athlete, decision making is required under conditions of intense mental and physical pressure (Anshel and Wells, 2000), yet much of the work in this area has largely ignored the highly stressful context in which athletes operate. A number of studies have shown that conditions of elevated pressure influence athletes' decision quality (Kinrade et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016), response times (Hepler, 2015; Smith et al., 2016) and risk taking (Pighin et al., 2015).

He said, "Oh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. 
Keeping the product upside down until it gets to the retailer has been standard practice at Frito Lay at least since I started working there back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer table.. 
I guess the other thing I don't know enough about is what Walmart does with its 6 billion profit. Is it that terrible of a thing if 5.4 billion goes back to the employees? What detrimental effect would that actually have on the company?

Like, what the fuck.. 
I don know the context of your relationship with this guy but if you consider him to be a friend, it kinda sounds like you betrayed him. I get that cheating isn good and it rubs you the wrong way but its his relationship and his problem, not yours. From what I can tell from the post, you didn know the girlfriend well, even if you did hit it off. Best you can do for someone as a friend is tell them what they doing wrong and hope they listen. If they continue to act like assholes, leave them be. Throwing him to the curb and telling his girlfriend behind his back no less was pretty underhanded and honestly a little uncalled for. Please try to put yourself in the gf's shoes. If my SO was cheating on me, I'd be very grateful that someone told me; I don't know you, but you'd probably(?) feel the same, as I find that most people generally do feel grateful in that situation. It's not "underhanded"; OP prodded him to tell her over and over again. That's more than enough fair warning. OP's "friend" is clearly a piece of shit.

People like to call it mutilation because it gives them a reason to then comment on other peoples junk, which in every sense of the scenario, is certainly none of their business. Alas, redditors are obsessed with dicks. However, if you remove the incentive to comment on peoples dick you realize that it isn mutilation at all. Why? because it doesn effect performance or feel. You are getting confused with what Muslims do. Do you think women who pierce their ears are mutilating their ears? Of course not. It just cosmetic. I just want to set the record straight, that even religion not included, there are health benefits and negligible risks (which are greatly outweighed by the benefits as pointed out by our non secular CDC) for getting the procedure done. So for someone to call it mutilation, they are simply ignorant of the facts.
I with you that usually the best idea would be to hell sell the fancy house in the fancy neighborhood, buy a regular sized house near where he got elected, and just move since most kids are resilient. I mean as is the show is saying his commute is 3 hours in a day   realistically it about that each way   but even going with the show, he essentially going to be up and leaving way early to get there and with all the work that will be in store for him he not likely to be back until fairly late.

Partendo da questo presupposto, ogni parte di noi, quindi ogni nostra funzione, ha una sua corrispondente nell'universo ed ha con essa un legame indissolubile, al punto che desidera che noi, nel nostro piccolo, seguiamo quella che  la legge di tutte le cose: l'evoluzione..

I sure there are other methods and various hybrid belt/bot systems, but I particularly like the second method. Note that regardless, you want a bunch of roboports close to the loading chests, and if you use active providers on the mining patch, roboports around the ore patch as well. Also, make sure the loading system is it own logistic network (not connected to the rest of your base), so that the bots will be strictly dedicated to loading at that station. 
In addition to having a limit on their heat, nonstick skillets don actually conduct heat as efficiently because of their coating, Good Housekeeping explains.

Meds like this are closely related to the chemicals in the body which actually activate this enzyme, and the med takes the place of the body chemical, but do not activate the enzyme, causing it not to activate.

But what is really and truly upsetting, what is causing me to shed a few tears, is that once again the mainstream media is ignoring the real story: hiring out to private, for profit companies our national defense. Not only is this costing all of us a lot of money since these soldiers for hire don work for peanuts and the promise of a college degree and the higher  ups in these companies earn salaries comparable to AIG execs, but more importantly, the US government has very little or even no control over how these mercenaries behave..

Also take caution with those that specialize. Massage therapy schools tend to cater to the lowest common denominator when recruiting students, so the Dunning Kruger Effect runs rampant through the industry. One particular trend I noticed is that practitioners of "advanced" clinical systems like Rolfing or whatever tend to think they have all the answers, and suddenly every problem in the body starts to look like a nail, because they learned to favor the hammer..

No, only a child would think that there's only one way to do things, and if that way makes you money, then that way is the right way. An adult understands how things works, but has the ability to also form an opinion about it, and realize that just because the world works a certain way, that doesn't mean you HAVE to like it.

Labor have had their MediScare campaign but it is somewhat reasonable to believe that a GP copay opens the doorway to stepping towards privatising healthcare.

The enormous ship as measuring stick is interesting, and the appearance of the ship amidst buildings is very attractive in a Dadaist sort of way, as an artistic non sequitur. That said, here another example, this from the Scientific American for 25 July 1908, showing what was estimated to be the maximum height (based on foundation and framing) of the still relatively new architectural ideal of the skyscraper.

Learning poker can be a very enjoyable experience and can truly open up a new branch of your life that you've never seen before. It is common for individuals to get together on a regular base to play poker not just for competition but as friends enjoying each other's company. Joining larger poker tournaments is also a great way to make friends considering fellow players already have something in common with you. It is also common for poker tournaments to serve a good cause and donate the pot or portion of the pot to a charitable cause. Of course, professionals are generally aimed at profiting but there aren't too many professions that offer such enjoyment.
