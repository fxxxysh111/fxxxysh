Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life.

Yet leaders who need their people's support to address complex, interdependent problems beyond their borders must socialise them into a twenty first century world in which caring without acting imperils us all..

The upper of a good walking shoe will be sturdier than that of a regular shoe, but more flexible than that of a running shoe. One reason not to do a walking routine in running shoes is that the traction of the latter is so deep it can make you jam your feet (causing toe injuries) and even stumble while walking. Take into account the thickness of the sock you expect to wear while walking (and you should wear thick, absorbent socks).

It also irritating, because they aren even bothering to take into consideration the clinical definitions of the terms that they using, just assigning those terms/ diagnoses to themselves and often times simultaneously dumping on non veterans who have been legitimately diagnosed specifically with C PTSD, and then people end up taking those of us with any form of PTSD who haven seen any combat less seriously. I lost count of how many times I brought up my diagnosis and someone will look at me funny and question whether I have military background and when I tell them know, that my C PTSD is because of 13+ years of abuse and neglect at the hands of a parent, they roll their eyes and write me off. It infuriating, and while they may not mean any harm, the stuff in those articles is still a big part of what creates and pushes that attitude.

Wouldn't you like to create similar experiences in the comfort of your own home with your friends? Going to a casino or a poker tournament is great, but there is something different about playing with friends. You start to learn their tendencies and use them to your advantage. You can share a laugh and enjoy some great food and drinks. It's a great way to spend time with your friends and family. It also seems a lot more realistic with a real poker table instead of playing on the kitchen table.

Of course, since then we have witnessed feminism, a restructuring of laws and opportunities, and a country in which most American women work full time (even if they still don earn as much as men). The point is, marriage is no longer necessary as a property exchange and yet the state has gotten more invested, more involved in awarding privileges and rights on the basis of it. She was shocked to see, ten years later, that there were several hundred more privileges given to the married among us.

This opinion piece in Politico Magazine argues that Republicans hoping that former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, or any other candidate, will challenge President Donald Trump for the GOP nomination "should be careful what they wish for." Rich Lowry, editor of National Review and a Politico contributor, argues, "Because a primary challenge would naturally come from the left, is unlikely to succeed, and involves alienating the GOP's grassroots, it is most likely to attract people who don't have a future in GOP national politics and lack conservative bona fides." He has this to say about Kasich: "On paper, Ohio's John Kasich is formidable, the former two term governor of a major state and House Republican budget chairman. But he was an edgy figure circa 1995.

Soaking acrylic nails in an acetone bowl is a lot better easier than this. Who is going to wrap foils w/ acetone cotton balls for u all ten fingers? If you soak your fingers in the acetone bowl, women need to be patience while waiting to soak their acrylic nails off. If they keep taking their fingers outside the bowl or above the acetone liquid, (which what most women do to peek at their fingers. Let's put it this way, keep peeking at the fingers don't help speeding up the process.) the acrylic will harden again very quickly. Instead of taking only between 20 40 minutes, some women takes 3 5 hours at home. And you can also watch "Will Grace" DVD, while doing this. Scraping the nails after soaking for 10 minutes will help speed up the precess, but DO NOT remove your fingers outside the liquid. I repeat you DO NOT take the fingers outside the liquid. Thus, using the orange sticks or somekinds of tools don't help in this case, unless you have someone else use the orange stick scraping for you.

I understand. I struggle a bit with spending too. When I feel like I going to spend on something I don need I try to remind myself that I am buying something else with that money: my future savings goals. It sounds cliche, but since I found FIRE, I been really motivated to spend less because by not buying a small indulgence now, I get more peace of mind an I get to get out of the rat race sooner. So I try to remind myself that I am purchasing my future and therefore have no money leftover to spend on something. Sometimes I slip too, but I do think it has drastically limited my spending and forced me to look at each purchase in terms of how it provides long term value.

If you look at the information just based on what you have it makes total sense for him to have Aces, or AQ, there's no way he has the confidence the check shove AK because he has already represented a good hand. So here are her options, she is calling for a chop, the 5% he is bluffing AK, or he has Aces. AK here has represented too much to shove confidently, so very unlikely. 
As for the players, who actually pays attention to the dealer making change and raking the pot? So long as they just shorting a white here and there, they can just say "Whoops" the few times someone calls them out and play it safe for a while whenever that player at the table.

That is probably that hardest step out of all of it. There aren't any walks in the park, and there aren't any vacations. I personally left everything and everyone behind, and I moved into the unknown. I had a great paying job in Australia, familiarity, family, friends, and memories. I left it all. I made a huge sacrifice and moved here with nothing. I worked my freaking butt off, and I still do to this day work 16, 17, or 18 hour days. Every dollar that I have I invest back in my business. Nothing comes easy in life. You have to work hard, you have to sacrifice, and you have to do whatever it takes. You have to put everything on the line. If you want to succeed, there aren't any excuses and it's going to take a lot of hard work. I don't believe in talent. I believe in hard work.

This is why your lease specifies not to use it. Sure, the poor quality paint makes the situation much worse, but I had trouble with it even on fairly fresh gloss paint. Actually it even worse than most stains are, because it oily, so they may well decide/need to use a stain block coat as well which is hella expensive per litre.The only (partial) way out of this, is if the "before" photos and condition report, when you moved in, shows that the walls were due repainting soon anyway, in which case you may be able to argue you should only pay half (what you call an amnesty against wear and tear).

Hi, Whether poker is legal or not depends largely on the country you are located in. In some countries it is legal, while not in others. Some countries do not have this matter defined at all, and it is up to interpretation whether it is legal or not. But make sure by checking on some local poker community of yours. As for live poker, tournaments are legal, but as for cash games   it differs from country to country as well. (Full Answer)

If you need to think about what a random variable is, an informal way to think about it is like a box. Let say X is a normally distributed random variable. In this case, X is "the box". We don know what inside the box until we open the box. Until we open the box and get a particular realization of what inside, we don know much about the box and we only talk about the number that might be inside the box. We need to label it in some way, so we use the label X (capital) to refer to it. For example, for a normally distributed random variable, E(X) = 0. This is a statement about the number that might be inside the box, so the variable is capital. Let say we open the box and find X = 1.02. In this case, inferences don really make much sense since we already know what inside the box. In this case, x (lowercase) was distributed by X, and x=1.02. x is our data. This is different than random variables because data is realized information that we know 100% of the details about. Now going back to the box, sometimes you know all the aspects of the box and what number might come out. Sometimes you don Inference is all about using realized data to infer aspects about our box that we didn know.

Another important time to exercise your own judgment over your poker calculator is when you have a huge lead or big chip stack in comparison to your opponents. In such a scenario when you have someone out chipped like 5 or 6 to 1, it is imperative you make underdog calls that normally are a fold situation. With rising blinds, short stacks will be going in with a wide variety of hands so except for dominated Ace X hole cards, you should be looking to get them all in. You won't win them all, but if you win one of three situations you are still the table captain.

Other fun facts: Ya know how corn is heavily subsidized and we put it in everything here in the US? Yeah, the bulk of that corn (and soybeans and other crops) use seed treatments containing neonics. They a systemic insecticide, taken up by the plant as it germinates and grows! That means they get in every inch of the plant! And it hard for farmers to find seeds that aren treated, even if they wanted to. The rest flows off to contaminate the soil and groundwater and all the plants near the fields that weren even treated. Oh, and soybeans? Yeah, they use seed treatment too. And the best part is that it doesn even really increase the crop yield. They just do it anyway. Because ag companies.

First off, the traditional ship we think of when we think of "Vikings" is most likely a longship, the most famous example of which is preserved at the Viking Ship Museum in Norway. The Oseberg ship has is a 15 "room" ship, meaning it has 15 pairs of oars, or "rooms" for 15 pairs of rowers (30 men in all). The Norse and early English ships seem to be divided that way into "rooms," from what we know from record keeping; Alfred the Great seems to have ordered several ships of 20 rooms and there were some that were larger. In any case, the Oseberg ship is fairly well preserved and has served as a model for perceptions of Norse ships since then.

On "living the dream" there is an awesome keys solo and I'd like to hear more songs with that kind of energy.

It depends on a lot of things. Certain tournaments for example give a set amount to each player (in some it's only like $1000, while in some other it can go up to $10.000 in chips). In cash games you can determine how many chips do you want to buy in before starting to play etc. In some tables you could start with like 5k40k while some others allow bigger buy ins ranging from like 100k1mil (just throwing random examples). So yeah, there's no set amount. It depends on the type of poker you're playing and it's current rules. (Full Answer)

We are going to have to leave 2 full time jobs and family behind to live further north because we can afford THE HOME WE WANT. So we will move. It sucks but I am not going to demand a change to the city I like so that it can become super dense and more crowded on the roads than it already is..

3 points  submitted 1 year agoTo be clear, leading out is a term only used for when someone in an earlier position than the last aggressor bets the street immediately after the last aggressor took the betting initiative. If it was checked to you and you in a later position than the last aggressor, your bet would just be called a bet or stab. In this particular hand since the last aggressor is the BB, you the only player who can lead; if anyone else did it it would just be a stab.Since in lower/medium skill games the vast majority of players almost always wait to see what the player with initiative does when out of position, leading (or "donk betting") looks very strong or at least peculiar. 
Don take my word for it though. 
Secondly, the pacifiers are gifted so the future ballerinas, you call your bouncers can all sleep together holding hands and suck on them at night making them go to sleep better at night.

Internalised bigotry is a thing, for one thing. Plus sometimes some disabled people are just less sensitive to things that most disabled people aren I still criticise those jokes, but from a different perspective. Incidentally, it probably possible for an abled person to make a joke which accurately reflects the disabled experience if they were well informed and had listened to the experiences of disabled people (I sincerely have never heard one, though), but anyone making that joke is inherently taking on a risk and even if the joke lands from a disabled perspective, I still criticise it because it not a risk that person would have a good reason to take.

First, wheres my invite. 2nd umm i think the best place atm is fresno hotel . i just think the challenge is actually getting access while not being seen or stabbed by a vagrant. also the tunnel down san joaquin gorge is a cool spot at night. also the abandoned mine off the Wellbarn trailhead would be a cool find, but for any abandoned mines theres numerous dangers that start creepin up. back in the day we would do the palm house but u have to be super sneaky. better to do it alone as its gated n security is on high alert out there. the access is some missing bricks in the back of the building by the roof. so hope u have some climbing experience or thatll be an easy snapped leg from a fall.
Edit: its been pointed out to me by a flood of retards that they are paper towels, not napkins. Apparently, the implication is that there is a big enough difference between paper towels and napkins that im an idiot for not not using their preferred noun   but judging from the downvotes, the difference between napkins (i mean paper towels) and a toilet roll isnt nearly as obvious. not surprising honestly from people who so readily confuse their heads with their asses.

4 lessons from FarmVille's CEO
One of the things I learned from dating a med student, and just relationships in general, is to never expect anything without communicating. I think that asking for your SO to send a check in message during a super busy time might do more harm than good. Residents have a lot on their mind and a lot to worry about. The last thing they want is to stress about another "to do" item.My suggestion would be to wait for their workload to die down a bit and then raise the issue in a non accusatory way. Perhaps starting with the fact that you like hearing from them, even if they don have anything new to report other than working/studying. Bringing up that you appreciate a message or call because you miss them and want to know how they holding up is much better than asking for a check in. It seems less suspicious and more caring.This is absolute horse shit. However, the article is just a rant about how financial advisors aren obligated to recommend the best products for their clients. Well no shit! If you thought that branch employees have a fiduciary duty, you a sucker and a chump.The Ontario Securities Commission confirms that "adviser" is a legal term under securities law that describesa person or company that is registered to give advice about securities, whereas "advisor" is not.The OSC just uses a different spelling. It doesn mean that individuals with certain titles are legally bound to keep their clients best interests in mind when executing trades or giving advice. In reality, all bank employees are pushed to reach their targets. What more important to them: their job and ability to pay bills or whether you get to retire in 30yrs?

Some AdvicePicking an instrument is never a permanent thing, and never forget that. You can always switch, you can always add another instrument to your repertoire. The best way to pick one is by the sound, or timbre, of the instrument, and the best way to choose is by having all available instruments played to you by an experienced musician. There are also a few physical restraints on what kind of instrument someone can pick; certain mouth shapes are more well adapted to playing, say, oboe, rather than flute, and some kids just will never have the arm length to play the trombone. But usually you can work around these; this counts more for professional musicians.
