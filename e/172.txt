I've worked in a prison and as a probation and parole officer. had the opportunity to see real gang members that will fight at the drop of a hat because someone disrespected their colors or their set. The coldest ones weren't much for talking or bragging about their exploits because well. they would show you. As a probation officer I spent a lot of time telling many a gang member who had not been incarcerated yet what life was really like for them in there. It's not as glamorous as they think. Even if you're gang is the only one on that unit, being placed in those confines with boredom all the time and testosterone "the homies" gang up and pick on the weakest members of their gang. You like doing drugs? Homies or not you better pay your debts. So all in all nowhere near as glamorous as the music makes it seem. Sorry for formatting (mobile).

It's a science class, very easy to avoid plagiarism but they had one assignment where they had to read some documents and regurgitate some uses of an object.

So dark matter has to have a small charge to mass ratio in order to agree with observational data. The easy way to do this is to have zero electric charge, but in principle a really small electric charge is allowed by experimental data. This is so called millicharged dark matter. I don know of any motivation for millicharged dark matter models, but that may just be my ignorance of those models. It worth mentioning though, besides electric charge, there also electric and magnetic dipole moments which are in principle allowed but also constrained (I don have any numbers on hand for these constraints). But you can get dipole moments easily for electrically neutral composite particles when the constituents are charged.

Speaking as someone who, along with my kids, went completely gluten and dairy free for years: Yes, they absolutely will eat differently at others houses. And in our case it was an allergy, but people still feed it to them all the time and lied when my kids were trying to be good about what they ate. When they got to middle and high school they chose to eat it. And I had to deal with the return of their symptoms. But with my older one I also had to deal with him lying to me because he didn feel safe telling me he was cheating on the diet   even when I said it was okay, and I just needed the facts so I could figure out if something else was going on that we needed to deal with.

Are you talking about Bell here? Because if so, I agree with you that he wasn a diva for wanting more contract guarantees. But the comment you were replying to was calling Antonio Brown a diva, and he is under contract for three more years (so not sure how he didn have long term stability, if you did mean Brown?) and yet is demanding a trade while torpedoing his trade value by talking nonstop to the media, seems to think he gets to pick his trade destination, apparently had to be constantly catered to on the Steelers, complains about his number of targets on a team where he is the clear WR1, etc. Oh, and throws furniture off his balcony. He did a great job last year for us, and I don blame him for wanting to cash in one last time. Hopefully the Eagles can trade him but they got such a huge return for value last year for what little they gave up for him that even if they have to release him, picking him up was still a great move. 16 points  submitted 6 days ago

To conclude that "CODE doesn have anything in common with the best unis in the world" from what I said is a logical fallacy. That not what I said or implied.

I actually surprised by all the hate and downvotes it is getting here, as for me and many others this university was a game changer. People are so mad that CODE students actually enjoy and believe in their university. I mean, how dare they, haven they heard school is supposed to suck??

These glands are usually connected to an individual hair follicle (except on hairless places like your eyelids and lips, where they work alone). Now that you know what they are and how they formed, you might want to know what they do. Sebaceous glands are responsible for secreting sebum, the natural oils that moisturize and waterproof your skin and hair. Deep in the skin's dermal layer, specialized secretory cells that absorb fats from the body enter the sebaceous gland and disintegrate. At this point, these cells become sebum. The sebum is expressed into the lumen (shaft) of the hair follicle, where it's excreted up to the skin's outer layer, the stratum corneum. In other words, your body burps excreted fats and cellular debris onto your skin and hair.

Let me briefly explain what it is. Let us have a look at the example. When you go to the bowling, you pay the fee before or after the game depending on how long you are going to play. The entry fee to the casino is free, but they make you pay for the games they provide you with. This is what house edge means. Each game has its own house edge due to mathematical calculations. In other words, the house edge is money made by casino over the long run of the game. You have to know two main things about it. The number thing to take into account is to play casino games, which have a low house edge. Thing number two is that the rules of the games may change the house edge. Blackjack is a nice game to start with. Its house edge ranges from 0.25% to 2%.

And that just wrong. You can actually quantify an exact edge % as a function of your betting unit or of your average bet using a given spread and given rule set.

That only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Fermi "paradox". One final point to consider, is that the early universe was much more hostile and dangerous than it is today. Gamma ray bursts were way more common (they immediately destroy all developing life on a planet), asteroids meteors flying around, crashing into things, stars going supernova more often as the first stars were larger hotter, and shorter lived, etc. A hypothesis that has been gaining a bit of traction lately is that it only recently that the universe has "calmed down" enough to allow intelligent life to develop and flourish.

The only reason to stay under the limit is if you only want to work a few days a week or something. And good luck finding a job that lets you do that other than McDonald's/Lawson.

Growing up, I wasn allowed to have any kind of boundaries at all. No door on my bedroom, no going to friends houses or parties. Anything I did on the computer was tracked. Couldn keep a journal because I knew my nmom would read it. As a result, after about 14 15, I never spoke to my mother about anything important   because it felt like it didn matter, she dig through my school notebooks to find the notes my friends and I wrote to each other and would demand access to all of my online accounts to read my private messages anyway. I wasn allowed to be my own person and have my own self image outside of what she approved of. I was miserable, and I worked very hard to just keep everything inside and never speak about anything of weight or value to my mother, lest she tear it apart or forbid me from thinking/feeling it.

I guess King wanted the book to be about something other than just the Kennedy assassination and thought he could add some heart to the story at the same time. He goes way overboard focusing on it, it takes up way too many pages and is not compelling.People sometimes complain about King needing an editor to trim down his books, and I think this book is one of the best examples of that.

However, we aren't done yet because we have to make sure that we don't get another queen or two more of the same previous two cards that we drew on the remaining two cards, because either case would result in four of a kind.

You've just cited another thing that has become more myth than fact: When those edits that you mentioned were made, they were done with the intention of being very obvious. and only on comments spuriously accusing Steve of being a child molester.

I have many interests, work hard although confined to a wheelchair, and have lots of friends. I am inclined to get quite obsessive about overcoming difficulties and had a dreadful time trying to restablish connections with h2g2. I fear that if it happens again I shall have to call it a day because at my stage of life I simply do not have the time to spend trying to get something which should be relatively uncomplicated, right. In fact time at my stage of life is the most precious commodity I have and I still have so much to do.

He rarely played at the dog park because he spent the whole time there going from person to person and leaning up against them in hopes that they would pet him.

Letting yourself have a setting with trains is totally cool. Do also think about what other technologies are necessary for trains (you need steel in high quantities, a good energy source to move them, etc.) so that you can make sure they make sense in your overall tech milieu (you don need everything that existed in the 19th century, I don think, but a lot of it will naturally be there).

This is another installment in a series on putting color into what we normally would think of in terms of black and white photos (and movies) the results are sometimes surprising and unusual. (There are posts here on the color schemes on 1930 schoolrooms in Cleveland, air recon in color, color dissonance in 1940 bathrooms, colorless color charts, and other such bits, all findable by entering "color black and white" int he Google search box.) The pamphlet below would sound like a simple and badly titled publication (How to Plan Walls that Please, by Armstrong Cork Products, 1938) if you were just reading about it in a catalog, but in real life, it is a symphony of exploding and unexpected color. I thought about and seen so many of these images in luscious grays and stark blacks that it is difficult to think of these same images in gigantic color. 
I mean I agree things are definitely heightened/exaggerated but I always saw it as being staged as a tragic melodrama, as many Darren Aronofsky movies are (the first sounds of the film are a symphony warming up, as if you were in a theater about to watch some operatic performance). The theme of the film is not "drugs are bad" but how addiction and the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream can get tangled and lead to one's self destruction, in this case it's characters using drugs to obtain that goal. So objectively yes, drugs like opiates and uppers can be very bad for you, people have gotten infections from using dirty needles, whored themselves out to maintain an expensive drug habit, get jailed for holding drugs, and have died/been irreparably damaged from legal drugs. I never got the sense that the movie was saying "try drugs once and you'll die" but saw it more as using all the tools of the medium of film to depict a tragedy of people who have good intentions but continue down a path that will inevitably lead to their own annihilation (a common theme of Aronofsky's movies).
While some of our parents might have been deluded enough to believe there is no such thing as "symbolic violence," journalists might be expected to know better. All, at the base of all language is the act of naming and naming has always been a divine source of power: from Creation when God got to name the world and all its creatures to today when political regimes get to name wars "peace keeping missions" and tax money for banker fat cats "economic recovery.".

This might make sense if the river was choppy, or ice bound, at which point it would be nice to use HyrdoplanePunk to get across the river. A bridge as bridge would accomplish this task without turning itself basically upside down and inside out. I said it is not so good to judge application of technology by a modern standard; though in this case it seems as though if you were to look just slightly into the future from 1869 that you realize a continuous flow across the river would be highly preferable to a car shuttling a limited number back and forth. 
From what I understand, scoring in halfpipe is fairly subjective. Different runs within a single phase of competition are judged relative to each other, not against an overarching objective scale. It not like figure skating, where every trick has a set point value with style adjustment, making a long program 200 in US qualifiers comparable to World Champs or Olympic Finals.

Just everything at the wall was great, and Hardhome was my favorite episode of the series. I also really enjoyed Dorne, although most people dont.

There are studies that link rape myth acceptance to victim blaming behavior, techniques of neutralization (which are statements that offenders make to themselves to "justify" what they did, or deny that they committed a crime), and sexual assault.

Binger doesn't mind gambling, per se, but he learned the pitfalls of blackjack as an undergraduate, when he wrote a computer program to beat the game through card counting (or, as the casinos like to call it, "cheating") for his senior project.

"I realized I wasn't going to get rich playing blackjack," he recalled.
