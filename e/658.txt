If in the tournament there are casino games with basic strategy such as blackjack or other games, then all you need is to follow the strategy. The only exception is few last hands (when the time is running out). If you need quickly to catch up with an opponent and you are running short of time, you may diverge the blackjack basic strategy and split tens or double. You may use various stake strategies even martingale. At the end of the day it is a tournament and you are not so afraid to lose your money but to increase the chances to win. In such a case, the dispersion is not your enemy, but friend. You have to take risks to succeed!

The consistent, eerie ads were noticed by journalist Bryan Hance, a student there in the late '90s. He became intrigued and made a website so he could discuss his finds with like minded people.

In January 1999, he was contacted by someone claiming to represent a member of an organization called "The Orphanage," the society behind the ads. They've been watching him ever since, occasionally dropping hints and generally encouraging him to solve their riddles, specifically stating: "When you see the door you will be welcomed inside."

It debatable. The kids parents might argue that a dog is likely to attract a child because most kids are naturally curious, and because dogs are, in other contexts, normally something kids are encouraged to approach gently. The owner might argue that dog penned in in the back yard, away from a kid who might wander past the property, could not have attracted them onto the property in the first place, and that the only reason the kid even knew there was a dog there was because they were already trespassing. Who would prevail depends on a lot of factors.

Worse, OP has a chemo port. She doesn even have to hit a vein. I agree with one of the comments in the OP, it sounds like she doesn actually know how to access a chemo port, which is astounding for an infusion nurse. She never got blood return. It sounds like OP Cath was clotted or something. When that happens you don infuse anything when you don get blood return. So I think that nurse has the perfect storm of incompetence and negligence to kill a patient if someone doesn intervene.

Early December 2012, anti free speech front group for the Universal Medicine cult, Real Media Real Change were scheduled to hold a cyberbullying conference at Southern Cross University, except they hadn informed their invited speakers of RMRC cult backing. Eight of the ten speakers cancelled when informed. Naturally we were seeking media coverage for the event, and a few days out I received a call from Hamish Broome, a reporter from Lismore paper, The Northern Star, saying he was interested in the story. He said he never heard of Universal Medicine. I told him my experience of the cult and its sleaze bag leader, Serge Benhayon, and he asked for contact details of other victims, which I didn have. I never heard from him again. Over half a year later, after having received a number of baseless legal threats from the cult using my name, I was informed Hamish Broome is the spouse of Sarah Davis, proprietor of Real Media Real Change. Hamish Broome never wrote a story about the conference, never intended to, never declared his conflict of interest to us and in an inexcusable breach of journalistic ethics passed our identities and information from myself and other victims to the cult.

Don't go wholly raw. Yes, there are legitimate reasons to enjoy raw plants in your diet, but I don't support the practice as a movement or exclusionary principle for eating. Humans have been cooking for well over a hundred thousand years. Some nutrients are enhanced by heat. Some anti nutrients (like lectins) are at least partially "disarmed" by it. Cooking methods with a mind toward maximizing overall nutrient value and bioavailability make good Primal sense and can lower your exposure to lectins.

For example: Let's say you raise pre flop, and then bet hard again on a flop of 9 3 J. Your opponent might have thought you were representing a pocket pair (a pair in your hold) by the pre flop bet   and now think you probably have a pair of 9s or Jacks on the flop because you bet. But if instead, the turn brings a 3 and you bet again, your opponent could be scared that you are on trip 3s, if you hadn't raised pre flop, only to turn around and bet hard on 3s, a "bottom pair," on the flop. A savvy opponent, with a made hand, could simply call your bets/bluff and rake in the pot. Pay attention to the sequence of cards (to represent a possible straight), suite/color (a possible flush) on the flop and watch how the betting unfolds. Try to represent having a certain/specific hand by having an attitude, good reputation, and being consistent with your betting pattern.

To find some key cuticle cream ingredients, you may not have to look further than your pantry. Many are made up of a combination of moisturizing vegetable oils, often including oil from the avocado. And when you add a little citrus to the mixture, you have more than a recipe for guacamole   you have a combination that not only keeps cuticles moisturized, but also helps them absorb that moisture. Though they're generally thought of as second best to cuticle oils, cuticle creams can soften rough cuticles after several applications. But they're not miracle workers. If you have severely dry cuticles, nails and skin, you might not see dramatic results simply by applying cuticle cream.

Then again even "canonically" trans representation sucks ass in most Japanese media so I not surprised either way. For instance, this is Yukimura Kusunoki. He canonically asks to be called male and is obsessed with learning to be more masculine and the male main character in a side story even basically confirms his gender and says he happy to have another "male friend" despite literally seeing Yukimura using the urinal standing up (but having to lower his pants due to his anatomy making it difficult to pee standing up just doing the usual unzip and pee method) and obviously seeing that Yukimura isn AMAB, but the story otherwise treats him like a typical "trp" character where the obsession over what his "true biological gender" is takes up a lot of his screen time. He also forced to dress in women clothing by another character, and even when his gender is accepted to a slight extent there very clearly a stylistic choice to keep him cute/feminine enough for the audience to want to give him "waifu status".

(This indicates that variables other than the adjustment/manipulation itself can influence the cortical responses in a given individual)17. "The passive head movement SEP experiment demonstrated that no significant changes occurred following a simple movement of the subject's head. Our results are therefore not simply due to altered input from vestibular, muscle or cutaneous afferents as a result of the chiropractor's touch or due to the actual movement of the subject's head. This therefore suggests that the results in this study are specific to the delivery of the high velocity, low amplitude adjustment/manipulation to dysfunctional joints."

As I said before, I believe that a recount should be performed after each election, not just this one. If they occur regularly, I don think they would cause more doubt in the election results. In fact, I think they would only strengthen the results and work to remove any doubt. However, I acknowledge that it would require a significant effort to perform a recount, and that the vast majority of the time the results would not be changed, only solidified. I believe that this is important, but I also understand that some people would disagree. Thank you for the civil discussion and new perspective, and have a good weekend.

Dude, get yourself some Sergio Leone. I never liked westerns (John Wayne stuff when I was young seemed so dated and weak) and Red Dead Redemption inspired me back in 2010 to try some spaghetti westerns. The Good the Bad the Ugly is probably the easiest starting point, but For a Few Dollars More and really Once Upon a Time in the West are equally great, the latter being my favorite of Leone. Corabucci is also great. Django, The Great Silence, The Mercenary are all good and offer varying levels of fun vs somber (Tbe Great Silence on the somber end).
I suspect the issues are broadly the same.. 
Villain has to call 11000 to win the 29000 in the pot, plus the possibility of up to 82000 more (the rest of his stack) if he calls. Since we already acknowledged your flop lead makes you look incredibly strong, which means you probably are going to bet again or check call most rivers, I am never calling with an overpair and almost all two pairs here, while I am also never folding a good flush draw. Most fresh or bad or unsound players would never fold any flush draw here.So then river comes and you shove double the pot on one of the worst cards possible for your hand.

And no matter how much we might allow that many women under consumer capitalism choose to wear bikinis and many Muslim women choose to wear hijab, there are severe limits to notions of choice within conditions of structural inequities.

Surgeons will be required, as well as the means to maintain sterile zones and re sterilise equipment after use. Waste management will be important, to prevent contamination of soils, living quarters or medical procedures from the likes of spoiled foods, human waste, bodies and samples.

But if she pulls the teeth of 2 of her 3 victims, then it doesn't make sense to me. Maybe it's as simple as something like she hadn't gotten to that room in the dollhouse when she killed Ann, so she didn't think to pull teeth yet.

Most chassis ground leads, [a lead connected to the motor frame] are not brought out with the power leads, to avoid confusion] normally the chassis ground is connected to a screw or through bolt, often colored green on the head of the bolt, and away from the terminal block or if in the terminal block positioned in such a manner it does not seem to fall into any possible "pattern" of the power leads. Five lead motors [if ALL ARE WINDING LEADS] are fairly rare and generally special, for example most single phase would be two, three, four, or six, many are four power with one chassis ground. It is important to note that any chassis ground wire needs to be absolutely identified as a chassis ground, [again, from a green screw and or colored green sheath].

With perfect information and numerous competitors, profiting was never going to be easy. But some grasped their competitors surprisingly well. For example, one trader quickly bought an asset, paying roughly true value. He immediately listed it for sale at a much higher price, found a buyer, and reaped an instant 85% return. Then, he ventured further. With the proceedings from the sale, he bought another asset, this time overpaying about a quarter above fair value. Again, he immediately attempted to sell it, asking for triple the price. Yet he found a buyer and pocketed a 200% profit. He also epitomized strategic intelligence: He accurately grasped that some traders were nave, so it made sense to buy an over priced asset because he foresaw flipping it at an even higher price. Contrast this with what can be expected from a trader with decent analytic skills   but lower strategic intelligence. She could have calculated that the asset was overpriced and simply avoided it, reasoning that overpriced assets are a poor investment.

It's not tribal to point out how people are acting, and it's not equal on both sides. Yes Democrats occasionally do dumb shit too, especially by being too pc. I understand the goal of pc and I'm not against it, but how it's implemented can sometimes drive moderate voters away and hurt what Democrats are hoping to achieve, and doing that is dumb. (For example, a recent women's support march that was cancelled because they felt they didn't have enough women of color.). But that small portion of dumbness is like a teaspoon compared to the tsunami of stupidity that Republicans and their supporters exhibit over and over again.

This clique of rookie lawmakers, who call themselves "Squad," represent four of the safest Democratic districts in America. They have come to Congress not to pursue incremental victories, but to push for wholesale change in the government and inside their own party, secure in the knowledge that their deep blue backyards will buffer them from whatever recoil might damage other Democrats in less ideologically insulated parts of the country.

If Harrison Ford turned up at our house, shirtless and with waxing strips stuck to his chest, and then pulled off the strips one by one with girlish shrieks of pain, we'd be unlikely to pay attention to a single word that was coming out of his mouth.

We'd be too busy shutting the door in his face, securely bolting it, and checking the rest of the doors and windows to make sure they were fastened securely.
