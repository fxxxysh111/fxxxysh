This side effect is only temporary and then the affected area will return to its normal condition overtime naturally, but there are some cases where it last for years.

I can definitely agree with this, I would need a lot more context on what actually happening there to really feel confident in judging his actions. However, there are a couple of hints that this situation hasn reached a point where an officer should anticipate being overwhelmed like that. He walking by himself which seems to be more of a show of force than actively stopping a riot in progress. Only one man accosted him, and after firing he allowed the suspect to walk away, which suggests to me that he fired as a deterrent rather than as a means of controlling a threat during an arrest. An example of a less severe tactic here would have been to aim the weapon at him while ordering him to back away, firing only if he does not comply.

Poker obviously has a gambling element involved, but poker does not feature high on the lists of gambling problem games. While I'm no expert, experience and observation tell me that the slower and considered approach to poker, which always involves some kind of strategy, is inherently different to perpetual blind hope whereby someone becomes desperate for the buzz of winning and will throw any money they have (or don't have) at a possibility of obtaining that feeling.

I used to play a lot of online poker and one thing I love about poker is how many lessons it teaches you if you think about it in the right frame of mind. Number one thing to learn about poker/investing is all money you have on the table is at risk. Number two thing to remember is that you have to adopt a strategy and play by that strategy consistently. You cannot second guess the outcome of a particular hand or a particular match or game. You research good strategy, you refine your strategy, but you have to keep in mind that swings will happen. Bad runs will happen. You cannot let it affect your mentality. It one of the hardest things to do. It the reason why most people will never be pro poker players or pro investors. After playing enough Hold Em games and seeing every table flipping bad beat I could imagine, I developed a stoic reserve. I learned to not let it affect my mood.

The biggest difference, aside from the aesthetics of the cameras themselves, is really in the film. As I said before, Polaroid film is quirky and not always reliable. Instax film more accurate color reproduction, develops faster, and has great clarity. Modern Polaroid film takes almost 15+ minutes to develop, so you can really stand around with your friends waiting to see how it looks like in the old days, but you can do that with Instax film. That being said, these great traits of Instax film also can give it a cold, "boring" look to it. As if it is just a normal film print you get from a convenience store. That not a bad thing for most, but if you want that specific, "vintage" look, you may be disappointed.

As you become more experienced, you will learn to read situations and know what is going to happen. A common example of this is when you have a top pair and a good kicker or two pair on the flop, which contains two cards of the same suit. You bet on the flop and are called. You bet again on the turn and are called. Then on the river the third card of a suit hits making a flush possible. After you bet again, the person who had been calling raises you. In low limit Hold'em, this means a flush will beat you almost every time. The only time you may not be beaten is when a solid player feels that you are capable of laying down a good hand for one bet and is bluffing you because of the scare card. This is often not the case. Situations such as this are learned with experience. So practice, practice, practice.

I liked this place because of the promo it ran   if you hit a full house you get a ticket into a raffle (they just put all the tickets into a box) and draw a ticket once an hour, if your ticket gets pulled you win $200 in cash. I was lucky enough to win it once. They also have a good full house promo thing where they put particular full houses up on the wall (for example 555TT and JJJ99) and you win a certain amount if you hit them (it was $1500 the last day I played). Pretty active room with a lot of tourists (especially crazy on Saturday night after some MMA fight or something happened in the hotel) but I did notice a lot of the same guys sipping water playing through the early hours feeding on the fish. Overall though a decent room plus you get $2 an hour in comps for food that you can use at Starbucks as well as other places in the casino. Side note   I never seen so many insanely hot women in one place. The poker room is just off from a nightclub and you get a steady stream of some of the world most beautiful women stumbling out wearing next to nothing on weekend evenings.

The way the Lead and Copper Rule is written, municipal water systems are supposed to test at a representative number of high risk homes to prove their water isn corrosive. So even if you have privately owned plumbing (like a sink faucet) that has a lead component, the water being provided by the utility should not be corrosive to those components. Obviously there can be situations where corrosion control has been optimized but certain scenarios will lead to high lead concentrations.

Loyalty isn about who respects these imaginary relationship boundaries you insisting exist. My best friend, whom I met when i was 5, dated a guy for a couple of months and decided she didnt like him. A couple of years later, i dated the same dude (for a year) and remained friends with her. She also remained friends with an ex that I would never speak to again, but that isn MY friendship, its hers, so who cares? It doesn affect my daily life, the boyfriend we both dated moved on with his life and we moved on with ours, and we still close friends. Friendship is about respect, yes, but respect for each other and each other lives outside of our own.

What this means is that the majority of students who apply to this school who aren't from North Dakota are pre screened out, thus the total number of applicants are smaller. Given the number of universities in North Dakota being significantly smaller than other states, UND MD being the only medical school in the state and UND preferring 80%+ of its students to be from North Dakota, 18% is not an alarming number. If I were considering more schools in this area, I personally wouldn't have bothered applying to this medical school not because it's competitive (spoiler, it is.

She's unbelievably toxic and dangerous. She is also the absolutely WORST kind of addict: the kind who is in active addiction, though in heavy denial (but they're prescriiiibed!!), and feels compelled to spread her addiction around to other people by pushing highly addictive substances in them. I'm a recovering opiate addict myself, although I am not a professional counselor or an expert of any kind. I just have my one narrow experience and those that I've learned about while in NA. I've witnessed other addicts "sharing" their addiction often getting younger siblings or vulnerable SOs addicted, and when they share in NA meetings, they talk about wanting to spread their guilt around, as if that will somehow lessen or mitigate it. Or that if a "good, innocent" person joins them in their addiction, then they can't be that bad. It's the kind of messed up reasoning that only an addict can come up with. It's also a horrible crime against someone.

One of the things that irked me is that when you done with an online match, you can be miles away from where you intended to go, and traveling to the final destination can be pain.

That night as I drove the hour and a half home from a rather difficult workout (for instance, we had to hold a push up position until we could cite the correct Bible versues by heart   a task I was ill prepared for), a thick fog rolled in. As I fiddled with the radio to try and find a station, the only thing that came in was an Evangelical preacher screaming about how Muslims want to kill us all. At that moment, truck lights bore through the fog and I had to quickly swerve to avoid arriving in Hell ahead of my time.

So in my case cohabiting prior to marriage worked just fine BUT here the difference: engagement and marriage timeline was on the table already, we also joined up our finances(which was honestly the biggest commitment to the relationship we could possibly have done), and it was simply far more frugal to share joint expenses. We were engaged 2 years later just like previously agreed upon, and married about a year later(I didn want to be stressed with a short engagement for planning purposes) but my husband and I have treated our relationship functionally as a marriage since committing to financial solidarity.

At Bible college we got many people sent to our ministry school from Teen Challenge. Many people would "turn their life around" and then go into the ministry. At the end of my freshman year a guy left the school and admitted he was an atheist and only came there to get out of probation or something. Apparently going into the ministry can get them out of a lot of trouble if they are working with the court system and able to convince the judge and Teen Challenge that God is going to use them. Some of the guys from Teen Challenge were genuine but some were openly faking it and others were a bit predatorial and I feel like should not have been sent to live among sheltered and nieve pastor's kids. 11 points  submitted 9 days ago

The knots you are describing could also be what is known as "trigger points". Trigger points are still relatively misunderstood but the theory is that in certain areas of muscles around the body, a small part of the muscle can become hyperactive through its innervation and form a taut band of tissue within the muscle.

Personally, if one of my children slaughtered my grandchildren and daughter in law I think my initial reaction would be something like "wait this can't be right, what really happened" but then after processing I'd be horrified and probably feel a sense of responsibility myself.

Similarly, a person's strengths are to be avoided when possible   a cunning person won't try to outfox someone in an area that he excels in.
