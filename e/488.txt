So multiplying that over the depth of the Mariana trench, you come out with loss such that to get 5 mW of power to the bottom of the trench, you need 1.5 x 10344 W of power at the surface. Which is too much. I haven done the math to see just how much of the ocean you be vaporizing at that point..

Benchmarking NDA Rafale deal against UPA RFP is a monumental follyBJP was right in its apple and oranges argument when Congress president Rahul Gandhi taunted it with figures of Rs 570 crore versus Rs 1,670 crore " the former that represented the price per Rafale aircraft supposedly negotiated by the UPA government through Request for proposal (RFP) from Dassault, the manufacturers of Rafale and the latter representing the cost of the fully mounted aircraft with India specific enhancements settled by NDA. The comparison between the two, thus, is odious and as incomparable as between oranges and apples twice over..

Each character is completely relatable to someone, and watching them overcome their flaws, or learn to how to deal with them when they become an issue, is likely to compel the audience to be introspective. Robin needs to learn to be vulnerable and depend on people in a healthy way, Lily and Marshall showcase the struggles of finding "the one" so young that you haven't found yourself yet, and Barney is everything wrong with hook up culture.

I am cool with the discussion of male assualt. It usually let taken over by the "But false rape allegations!" crowd. Male sexual assault is a problem and a lot of those problems are the result of societal problems that cause female sexual assault (toxic masculinity, ideas about gender roles and sex). That can contribute to a discussion about sexual assault. Talking about false rape allegations in a thread about rape and sexual assault implies that actual rape isn a problem because a small minority of publicized false accusations occurred.

Why not use a part of this water to wash things off? Those famed Roman fountains were designed to overflow, intentionally flooding the streets in an attempt to clear the refuse into the sewer system.4 And it worked for waste! It was a solid solution to attempt to correct the problem, though obviously a periodic one. Flooding the streets may have been a stopgap measure to curb the city waste problems, but regular flooding only serves to exacerbate mosquito breeding, a phenomenon which is evidenced by the incredible death rate of malaria and other mosquito borne illnesses.5 The Roman elite even often chose to leave the city for extended periods of time in an attempt to escape the endemic waves of disease, especially during the fall. Celsus mentions seven times over that autumn is by far the most dangerous and deadly season,6 Pliny the Younger left Rome for his estates for healthier weather while complaining about those who choose to stay within the city, forcing people to meet with them at the worst time of the year.7 Even Seneca notes that the best defense against illness is to flee.8 Horace goes into detail multiple times, describing the superiority of the country to the city, specifically emphasizing the health benefits of avoiding the city of Rome in the fall.9 While this option was clearly unavailable to the vast majority of Romans, the fact that it was an option for the wealthy showed that Romans themselves were well aware of the malignant effects illustrated by Shaw's epigraphic analysis.

The scoring is not consecutive, meaning that it doesn't go 1 love, 2 love etc. Instead, the point system is different, going '15 love, 30 love, 40 love, game' or 'love 15, love 30, love 40, game'. The first score is the player who served, and the second is the opponent who is receiving the serve. Zero points is referred to as love3. When the score is equal, the umpire calls out '15 all', unless the players both have 40, where it is called deuce. In this case, the next person to win the point has an advantage, and this is read out as 'Advantage (insert person's name here)'.

The best one can do, most of the time, is "make a very broad guess," he says.

If you know anyone who will be tailgating then start with that. Enjoy grilled meats and drinks. Or you can pick up a cheeky cronut from Buckeye Donuts. Otherwise, get to Varsity Club early and enjoy live music, and drinks. You can pick up food at any vendors around or on Lane. Skull Session is approximately 2hrs and 20min before kickoff. This is a must IMO. Enjoy the band, the speeches and really take in the energy before game time. You'll have time afterward to explore tailgates around the stadium/French field house. People are friendly and will typically welcome you in to join them for drinks and food. Then enter the game with plenty of time to see the ramp entrance and script Ohio. Stand, be loud, and enjoy the atmosphere. After the game explore The Buckeye Grove and look at all the All American plaques. Make your way through campus and end up at my favorite pizza in all the world: Tommy's. Order a large "all the way", get a pitcher of beer and celebrate yet another win over TTUN.

Whats the impact of AI on Creativity
The public likes simple answers. They want to believe the guy who tells them to try something very simple. The problem is that once we know it doesn work, a lot of people like to double down on stupid and say you didn try it right, or at the right time, or you have to do something else first, etc.

 1 point  submitted 20 hours agoI agree for the most part but the Eagles in 2016 spent a lot in free agency on free agent QBs ($18M/year on Bradford and $7M/year on Chase Daniel) before trading up a boatloat of picks for Carson Wentz. The stated goal of these moves was to take as many shots as possible for starting or hopefully franchise QBs   and one move worked.The Giants are in a position to do something like that right now, and while they could easily draft a QB high (more likely have to trade away multiple high round picks for one), I think they should also be working free agency to take more shots.

The turn is a brick but that doesnt mean hes going to continue to barrel with every bluff he used on the flop and in this formation I think hes lacking in bluffs in his preflop range. On the other side almost no players are going to check back value here.

From Facebook The best way to get loads of poker chips on facebook is to ask other players to donate their chips to you or buy them from various sites which may be untrustworthy. One way to get free facebook poker chips would be to. WIN them! Yes, the game now gives a lot more chances to win poker chips, and a lot more than before. Regarding what someone said that you can also buy them from some websites, yes it's true but there are some pros and cons to this. For instance on the Pro side, you get chips a lot more cheaper than you would get them from in the game. On the Con side, most websites do not deliver in proper time. or at all in some cases. Of course if you have a very "rich" friend that has a lot of poker chips, and plays on high stake tables you can also get poker chips from him :). In any case what everyone should watch out for is Scam emails and messages in facebook where you are supose to be awarded or baned for any reason, and you are asked to click a link to verify your account, where you would need to login of course; when you login to that link you don't actually verify anything you just give out your password and account to some hackers. The website may look very well like facebook or any other kind of security invented wesbite. NOTE : You must have a zapak id. 1. Go to any messengers like yahoo, rediff or gmail. 2. Sign In 3.

I wish more people would see things in this way. Our current economic system prioritizes and rewards profiteering above all else. There is no incentive to conduct business ethically outside of what the "fringe millennial hipsters" say. Many times, ethical business practices are too expensive to entertain. Sure, you want to start a business, you want to do it correctly, you want to treat and pay your employees well. Remember, you competing with the real world, the real world that cuts costs in labor and cuts cost in ethical material resourcing and cuts cost in responsible environmental practices. Someone with a questionable conscience could do exactly what you do, but for a much lower price; so people vote with their wallets.

I think there this assumption that everyone knew their place (they did) so it didn need to be talked about. 
The inclusion of "God" in the pledge and the exclusion of "equality" seem to be the reverse of the original intention of the pledge unless of course the necessity of counterplay against godless Communists is still a requisite for a statement of fidelity to what the American flag represents not to mention the separation intentions of the Founding Fathers.1.

The magazine on the UMP for example already wears at 0.00000000 (so absolute factory new) at a greyvalue of around 195.

It has nothing to do with anatomy, and everything to do with his insecurities. This is a control tactic employed by narcissists. Your amount of sexual partners, or lack thereof, was never his concern.
Sibling relationships are also the source of a lot more conflict than voluntary friendships and one of the biggest social development benefits is that as a result children with siblings become better at managing conflict than only children.The tendency to be friends with people in your age group goes beyond children; even elderly people show the same preference. And though very high IQ children actually tend to desire older friends more, they also struggle more to make friends in general.

I refused to write a toast, and planned on staying silent during the speeches (mom and sister knew this.) however, a lot of people gave speeches about my brother in law, including his sisters who were my sisters bridesmaids. It was infuriating, since I hated him too (in retrospect I was a selfish, jealous, and hateful person a few years back). So I just stood up and said "everyone talking about X, so I gonna talk about Y." I turned any memory I had into a short quip about my sisters positive attributes and how she dreamed to be a wife and mother. My sister bawled her eyes out and it made me realize, it does no harm to say nice things.

That have to wait a bit.Also being treated differently isn necessarily better, besides OP isn talking about ways of being treated but of "classes" of individuals which is what I am objecting to.Okay, when I said "treated differently" in that context I meant "treated better"; it better to be tall versus short, confident vs having low self esteem, etc., etc.That, in essence, is my point. 
I obviously do not intend to do this, just thought it was an interesting random thought that popped into my head. 
My massive inferiority complex has convinced me that everyone else is too good for me. I have nothing that makes me stand out as a desirable partner or friend, so I don even bother out of fear of hurting myself or wasting somebody else time. I have no hobbies, no passion, no motivation, no real reason for living, but I too cowardly to die, so I crawl lazily from day to day, living in the same rut, doing the same things, hoping something will change and someone will come to save me.

As for quality of player, the bad players can typically be figured out pretty quickly by hand selection, passiveness, bet sizing, how they handle the cards, etc. It can however take many many hours of playing with someone to figure out if they are actually good or just competent.
Literally every person who wants to do business, whether it themselves as a "brand" or just to generate a revenue stream, needs to have a plan, see what the competition is up to, and then spend a minimum amount of time, money, and effort to be competitive to gain market share (in this case, viewers and subscribers).

Seconding this. I'm injured now and out for what's looking like 6 weeks (hello cross training!), but leading up to my injury I'd get horribly nervous the day before/day of hard workouts, despite always doing rather well in them and having no real reason to get nervous. With the perspective the injury has given me so far, I was putting too much pressure on myself (mentally and physically), and that perfectionism made me sort of lose the fun part of training..

Nearest public transportNana BTSI was coustomer since 2005: at Eden womans was average old (more than 35) and beautyness average low. But I was lucky because I fount the 2 3 womans that was one women: not stunning at, not Barbie Doll but with that particular capability to make as a rock what i wave in pant every time i meet them. It was related to feeling and chemistry, not else. Rarely I fount one in my live and every time i fount, i went always with them. So, to me Eden was special because they was there. Unfortunately, late in 2011 the last one get out of sex business, as conseguence Eden down in quality at my eyes. Anyway, I see now the Eden web site totally renew: new graphic, but over pic of girls are publyshed, and they seems to be nice, over the low average ratio Eden was uset to have. Question: someone recently (april 2014 or late) went there and saw girls quality got better? If wildness of service stay the same but ave go down and beauty go up, I will feel to go back to be customer next time i will land there.

Not necessarily but sure the thought did enter my mind and the points can still be applied if not directed at you. Glad to hear you not. Points about casinos, bigger ones anyway,show that they are systems in place and staff are trained. I wouldn really worry about it, if you don trust the game don play. I apologise if you took offense,like I was blaming you.
Although Palace played with a back four and Wolves a back five, both employed a narrow midfield that shifted across the pitch aggressively when Arsenal switched play to the flanks. Consequently, Arsenal struggled to find the bar line with one twos as they had done previously.

Yes the well off use as well. What's the lowest common denominator? They are suffering from mental illness, loneliness, and a lack of human connection. If we heal that, people's lives improve and don't have to use drugs to cope. 
Here's a distasteful animal secretion   that gooey stuff that snails excrete during the course of their travels. Chilean snail farmers, who were up to their elbows in snail goo each day, noticed that their hands were softer and smoother, and that small cuts healed more quickly without infection.

Further investments are needed to enhance the competitiveness of NAFTA as a whole, and generate more of the kinds of high quality jobs that NAFTA's critics crave, Hufbauer notes. "Each of the three governments must enhance its country economic competitiveness by domestic reforms in areas such as education, infrastructure and tax policy. But by cooperating"   with one another, rather than trying to protect their markets from foreign competition   "they can spur the entire North American economy." Most major firms are aware of the opportunities ahead. 
I only have about 500 hours in TF2. It been a very long time since I played it, but when I played it, the only option was the server browser. 
After the blinds and antes (if applicable) are placed, each player is dealt two down cards (called hole cards). Then each player starting with the player to the left of the big blind has an opportunity to call (place an amount of money equal to the previous player's bet) the big blind, raise the bet (to place a bet higher than the previous player's), or fold (resign from the round of play). When the action (or betting) gets to the player in the small blind position, he/she can call the partial bet they initially placed, raise the bet, or fold. 
The tournament context increases this effect further. Assuming you are playing for the prizes, not just for your own ego, embrace risk there is no difference between going out first and going out twentieth, but there is a big return to doubling your stakes very early on.

Her classmates just don see her as a human. They see her disability as an issue to be eradicated. They see her Asperger Syndrome as something to fear. 
One of the things that irked me is that when you done with an online match, you can be miles away from where you intended to go, and traveling to the final destination can be pain. Another problem is that transitioning from multiplayer to single player could bring some of the conditions of the former to the latter. When I shifted out of a match, the fact that I was shooting at a rival player created a ruckus and the police were sent after me. This meant fleeing the police right after getting out of a multiplayer, something I didn want to deal with. I suppose that means players should use force more judiciously. Firing indiscriminately and running over civilians does affect Aiden reputation and makes some people more likely to call police if they spot him.

Agreed but the problem is, apparently, that if you do indict him and his manufactured supreme courts side with him, it makes the democrats look stupid and takes the bite out of all the investigations and everything.

Along with the written, formalized rules we all know and are familiar with, every game also has a big list of unwritten rules that everyone knows to follow. Violating these unwritten rules often isn't illegal, but in the big outside the game picture, this often results in very real repercussions whose very existence has obvious influences on the game world. This makes the study of unwritten rules a useful tool to understanding how games really work, or at the very minimum a helpful explanation as to how you became such an unwelcome presence in other people's homes.

Among the most used terms is slow playing. This technique can help you when playing tournaments at WPT Club a lot!

You are trying to merge two different concepts: strategy and tactics into one concrete plan. This cant be done because as you have eluded to: different villains play different styles.

He just has this fantasy about being a pro golfer or pro poker player and feels trapped in a regular type job even though he definetely has the potential to succeed in one. Should I just accept that this is the way he is and let him do what he wants as long as he isn't talking to other girls?
