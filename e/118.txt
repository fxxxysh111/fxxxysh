I thought Mazda mitigated the wind/road noise in and newer models of the Mazda3? That a shame to hear. I really like the car otherwise. I always read that the Mazda3 has issues with road noise, though coming from a Civic, it certainly can be much worse.

Ok, so your kids are old enough for some age appropriate explanation here. Along the lines of daddy loves you very much but the way he treats us when he gets angry is unacceptable and he needs to learn some different ways to act.

My first chiro was manual, but she was a 6 vet who I felt did a good job, but did not adjust things like sternum and pelvis (not that I blame her because my horse kicks). I now use a tiny Australian vet who also manually manipulates, but she doggedly goes after everything, and has giant foam blocks the size of haybales to stand on and prevent my horse from kicking her. 
Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to incompetence.

Start your day as a producer.

Note I am pro choice and I believe humans own their body: the State cannot force a woman to harbor a foetus in her womb, as it cannot forcefully inject anything into her circulatory system. Abortion should not be illegal, however dramatic it is when it is practiced. Late term abortions are particularly immoral in my opinion, but that is for each concerned party to weigh in conscience..

The ad game for the new Disney series "Pair of Kings" appeared on Poptropica beginning on September 9, 2010. The game posits that Boomer and Brady have been taken into a cave maze by the Tarantula People, and they have to be found and rescued. Getting hit 4 times means that you must restart the game. The path is up and right, using the elevator rocks, then across to the left. When you encounter a tall rock, drop through the hole to the lower level and continue left. Climb the vines, jump right, and jump past the warriors and Mummy to reach Boomer and Brady at the upper right. You receive a Pair of Kings costume set, and a Volcano God effects card. The effect causes a harmless shaking of the ground and a few showers of aerial lava rocks. A poker hand consist out of 5 cards. The highest card(s) win of course the hand. In this case I'm going to give you an example. Since there is no 5'th card I'll use X for it. In this case the highest pair (or valid combination of more then 2 cards) is the Aces. The pair of Kings Queens looks like KKQQX. As you can see here, the highest pair (or valid combination of more then 2 cards) are the Kings. Because the Aces are of course higher then the Kings, the hand AA22X (or Aces and Deuces) win the hand. (Full Answer)

In contrast to the feelings based behavior noted in the elaboration likelihood model, reasoned action posits that an intention to behave is purposeful, goal oriented and unaffected by feelings and emotions.

The Brits are correct to say that such a scandal, where a major politician talks about their lust for "boys" and sex tourism, would destroy any American or British politician. But even if the French themselves have been rather "c la vie" about Mitterand book, they have their own far right and it no surprise that the Le Pen folks are fanning the flames of this scandal.

I think Stone's arrest just opened up another level of crimes and implicated a greater number of people while simultaneously confirming everything Mueller has already known.

What makes it more difficult is when someone goes from 0 to 100 like you did earlier, reading way too much into a mod action and accusing us of fetishizing women as the reason. We heard it all, we too pro Korea, too anti Korea, ethnic Korean nationalists, white sexpats, etc, so those comments have lost their meaning and the truth is the accusation about us usually says more about the preconceptions of the person making the complaint than any of us on the mod team. I don know the other mods that closely, but I wouldn categorize any of them as anti Korean and there a variety of nationalities and ethnicities on the mod team, including Korean for both.

Where Pablo?: Pablo Sandoval is playing first, third and catcher and he a switch hitting machine. Isn it fun to check the starting lineup every game to see which position he playing? So what if he already had two passed balls. Right now, it doesn matter what position he plays as long as we get to see him take his hacks. He 14 for 32 and hits to all fields. He doesn walk much (once), but he also doesn strike out much (twice). OK, I realize Sandoval only 32 at bats into his career, but right now, it a blast to see him hit. He has guts to start at third base in the major leagues, even though he isn very experienced there. This weekend, the Padres hit the ball to him three times at third (two grounders on Friday and a sacrifice bunt Sunday), and he made the plays.

(I picked up the sax because I was bored with the clarinet   plus they wouldn't let me in the jazz band with a clarinet   even though I mentioned klesmer music to them, they weren't interested.)The embouchure on the sax is dependent upon the lower jaw.

The OP article is on an issue that broadly affects men but from a minority viewpoint. Sure, virgin shaming is relevant no matter your sexual orientation, but that doesn mean that the experience is the same for everyone.I totally disagree that having this viewpoint shared will mean that no one is going to talk about the effects virgin shaming has on non asexual men.Basically, if you want to have a non asexuality focused discussion of virgin shaming, please either find a relevant article and post it, or create a self post to garner discussion.

If I am making the same amount of money as that lazy shit of a coworker that's always on his phone, bitter to talk to, has almost no customer service skills, then why should I try to work any harder? After all, a server is part of the experience when you go out to eat. Part of the reason they're so calm when you say some condescending shit is because they're hopping for that tip. Take the tip out of the equation, there's no incentive to get your beer any faster, refill that soda, or keep my mouth shut when the customer is being a prick. People bust their ass for that tip, it's part of the culture in the States, and I think if you got rid of it you'd see a decline in quality service.

Nope. Apparently, because I was a foreigner unaccompanied by a Korean chaperone, I was not allowed into the club. What worse is that the bouncer told this to the stranger I was chatting with and not to me, which really struck a nerve with me and caused me to yell at the bouncer (in korean) that this is not acceptable and there is no reason to bar me from entering the club. "Well, we only play Korean music here, and you might be uncomfortable." I love Korean music! Let me in! "Well, the clients are Korean here, you might not fit in." I love interacting with Koreans with the exception of this current moment, let me in! "Well, you here by yourself. We dont take people by themselves, go to the club across the street." An hour later I went to a different club (again by myself) and as soon as I got to the front of the queue, "We are sorry but no." Yup, got it. Months later I went back with 3 Korean friends and they let me in, but not before the bouncer asked my friends if that foreigner over there was with them.

The difference between casino style gaming and poker is that the casino has set up various ways for you to wager money, against the odds, hoping for some easy money. When you are playing poker (and I don mean 3 Card Poker, Carribean Stud, etc., I mean traditional poker, played against live opponents) you aren playing against the casino, you are playing against other people just like you. An educated, disciplined player has a big edge against a player who is there for simple recreation, or just to gamble, without regard for odds and probability. After the first time you visit, you know exactly how much is the maximum you lose each time you play, and once in a while you win. But you WILL lose, unless you only play against other gamblers and are much better than they are, because over the long haul everybody gets as many good and bad cards as everybody else and the house takes a percentage to cover expenses.

Essentially, imagine that you're a hunter in a "Dark Forest". When you encounter another hunter, you have two options: kill him or not, and he has the same two options. Your goal is to ensure survival of yourself. In this case, if you choose to not kill him, you have to rely on him being nice and not killing you. This is up to chance. Now, it's obviously fool proof to simply kill him as soon as you see him, that way he can't kill you if he wanted to. Under this logic, it's also wise for you to make as little noise/bring as little attention to yourself as possible, in fear of being discovered by some better hunter who will, for their own safety, kill you before you can even detect them.

Women in technology jobs are overwhelmingly outnumbered by their male counterparts. At TipTap Lab, we have about an even mix of men and women working in our departments, including our engineering and technology team. This isn't something that should be terribly surprisingly.

Unfortunately, the welcoming working environment and equal gender ratio at TipTap Lab are the exception, rather than the rule. [You can view the recording here.]

Met some friends today, all were really happy and quite good mannered even though I felt like crap because of the pollution. On the bus ride there. The bus driver was super enthusiastic and kind (and man I seen some shockers on this route). I walked around a new subway station and could feel a lot of friendly attitudes. I got home and got some beers from CU, the old adjumma was the kindest person I ever seen at a CU. She was above and beyond and the only person in the large store. Got into my elevator, a couple and adjumma are talking about some new product she had next to her, I think it was a new bed blanket. They all kind of put me in the conversation and it felt nice as they were neighbours of sorts.

Alive Dismal Japanese Reviews Hurt New Mission Entry ChancesSquare Enix stealth shooter game "Left Alive" has been bombarded with bad reviews after its release in Japan. Potentially, the failure of this project could bury the "Front Mission" franchise even more due to the outcome of this spin off entry. Here's what we know about this. According to Siliconera's report, "Left Alive's" release in Japan was met with criticism due to the game's issue with its controls, character motions, graphics and its poor design. Its Amazon Japan rating is only 1.8 out of 5. Soon after, the game had its streaming blocked on the PlayStation 4 and has received a price .3 days ago

Nur sputen sollte man sich ein bisschen. Denn die Reise geht nach Madeira, und die 60 mal 20 Kilometer gro Insel im Atlantik ist ein beliebtes Reiseziel an Weihnachten und Silvester. Die Hauptstadt von Madeira, Funchal, ist von vielen deutschen Flugh aus in rund vier Stunden zu erreichen. Die Gegend rund um Funchal ist jedoch sehr zersiedelt und deshalb sei jedem, der nicht nur f das Silvesterfeuerwerk nach Madeira kommt, empfohlen mit dem Mietwagen schnellstens gen Westen zu entschwinden.

The "how troubled you were" and "your issues" were what stood out to me most in this whole thing. She apologizing while very clearly, directly, and inflammatorily attacking you. The problem wasn what she did, it was how troubled you were. The problem wasn her or anything she responsible for, it your issues.

Update: I spoke with a buddy who worked on previous seasons and he said they have preset rooms for the interviews and they shoot interviews "every couple days". So not everyday but that's still more frequent than most of the shows I've worked on. I'm sure they still do interviews later in the season for earlier episodes for coverage. During production the footage is constantly being sent to post production for editing so as they edit episodes they send notes back to the producers/story team about what they're missing like a cast member specifically referencing an incident or other story and production works it into shooting.

There are of course some caveats to this. Like you alluded to, if you have a large post flop edge, the EV of weaker hands go up and we can prefer calls rather than just taking down the blinds. Similarly, if we open, for example, 66 UTG, we might ideally prefer that all 8 players call behind, simply because when we flop a set, we can win a massive pot, even if we lose most of the time.

In the last 24 hours I come across two antiquarian outlooks on the longevity of the world coal supply after not having seen hardly anything of the sort written in the 19th century. (The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy". Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know. This one was a tabular presentation of 34 metals, listed alphabetically, and listing the year of discovery and discovery first that was the unusual part. I recall that Thomas Young (1773 1829) A course of lectures on natural philosophy and the mechanical arts contained a series of timelines for the different disciplines (a sample of which is below) including an unexpected entry for optics.
