In practice, GTO is near impossible to achieve in any game besides heads up. Given in 6 Max and full ring, there are a lot more players and thus a lot more variables that cause an unexploitable strategy to be very hard to find. And I think this is the point to take away. People very often get strung up on the word GTO, but it is just a strategy, but a very difficult one to formulate. And also, unexploitable strategies take different shapes and forms in different situations. A GTO strategy in a 4 max tournament will look a lot different to a 9max cash game GTO strategy.

Desmond made history by refusing to give up her seat in the section of the Roseland Theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, on Nov. 8, 1946. On a business trip to Halifax to sell her line of black hair care products, her car broke down. Repairs would take until the next day, so Viola decided to see a movie. She bought a 30 cent ticket. After taking a seat an usher ordered her to the balcony. Returning to the box office, she attempted to pay the 10 cent difference for a main floor seat; she was refused. Suddenly Viola realized the theatre was segregated; black people could only sit in the balcony. Desmond grasped she was being targeted because of her skin tone. Defiantly, she retook her main floor seat. Arrested, the police dragged her from the theatre. Desmond spent 12 terrifying hours sitting up, white gloves on, the image of dignity.

Play money can be re purchased only in 're buy' tournaments. The former are those where the organization holding the tournament beforehand decides upon the winner.

Drug addict, high on opiates used an exacto knife to cut between the shaft of the penis and the inside of his cock head.

I can definitely agree with this, I would need a lot more context on what actually happening there to really feel confident in judging his actions. However, there are a couple of hints that this situation hasn reached a point where an officer should anticipate being overwhelmed like that. He walking by himself which seems to be more of a show of force than actively stopping a riot in progress. Only one man accosted him, and after firing he allowed the suspect to walk away, which suggests to me that he fired as a deterrent rather than as a means of controlling a threat during an arrest. An example of a less severe tactic here would have been to aim the weapon at him while ordering him to back away, firing only if he does not comply.

I've never understood where Vito was (or, better yet, could have been) hiding just before he appears seemingly out of nowhere, pops Jackie Jr. in "The Army Of One". It doesn't add up: A.) It's broad daylight on a narrow street up a steep hill. B.) Vito ain't exactly a small guy. Vito was there, but he wasn there physically. The thought process changed once Jackie Jr. starts walking. The visual prowess adds a different part to the whole scene. At one hand you see Jackie resistance to comply with the rule which can be called a Machiavellian art, on the other hand you see or should I say, don see Vito Spatafore who tries to end a major no no by dislocating Jackie from this world. The snow adds a different dimension as well, as it claims that the environmental circumstances could have prohibited this from happening, but it could have not prevented either.

The size indicates the diameter of the ball when it is fully inflated. Smaller and larger balls are available, but they are not as common.

But another important point is that subversion is usually used before raw force. Socialists and working class elected officials are often off by high salaries and comfortable positions. Why would such an official want to challenge their own privileged position in that case? Also, the media hegemony limits ideas that challenge the system its owners rely on. But if it has to, the ruling class will defend its own personal interest with violence. If the majority of people want to overthrow a government, then the police will be expected to stop such a movement, even if it has a huge popular mandate.

A family in my church had 12 brainwashed kids. I'm amazed they were never on the news for their shenanigans. They decided that the oldest daughter would be allowed to go to college. I was surprised at this and wanted to know all about it. She was going for business management and God had told the mother of this girl that she was going to open a "Christian family restaurant" that they would all work at. I asked what would specifically be Christian about it. She said it would have a dress code mainly for the women and only let in people who were modestly dressed. I waited to hear the rest but that was it. Sounded like a fun place. The girl ended up moving in with her boyfriend and scandalizing the family. By the time that occurred I was at a place in my evolution to feel happy for her.

A star is one parsec away if it moves in a little circle with a radius of one arc second (1/60th of 1/60th of one degree) over a year. If its little circle is half an arc second, it two parsecs away. If it 1/10th of an arc second, it 10 parsecs away. So, given that astronomers like using arc seconds to measure angles in the sky, using parsecs makes the mathematics really simple. It a geometric unit that we can measure directly. Light years are less direct, because we can directly time how long it takes light to reach us from a distant star   we have to calculate it from the speed of light and the distance.

Almost all prefab laptops come with an SSD and an HDD drive. The SSD ranges from 128 to 512 GB and it where the OS is installed. The HDD is typically 1 TB in size in those laptops. But there are laptops (like the MSI GS Stealth variants) that may only have an SSD but no HDD. So you might be stuck with like 512 GB of space or even 256 GB. That laptop I mentioned would suit someone that wants a slim and light laptop design, good performance but doesn need much hard drive space. I just took it as a reference to have something to link. Maybe check for reviews on google or something.

You actually told your people this, not caring that most of them were in fact advertising people..

William James (in his The Varieties of Religious Experience, 1902) found Molino to be a "spiritual genius" (p. 130) and his Quietism to be a "transcendental idealism", with "a healthy minded opinion of repentance" (p. 130). He seems to have found nothing threatening in the man, and his imprisonment an "abomination". The issues were longer and deeper than this, with 250+ points brought up before the Inquisition, including "moral deformity"), but on the whole Quietisme seems as destructive as George Fox Quakerism, which seems to have shared many spiritual practices with Quietism.

What if no one is contributing any of those? Do I just continue to change my request until someone fulfills it? Do I retain any of the remaining points if I succumb to asking for something of much lower value? If I'm not getting the true value of what I'm contributing back, then it devalues the proposition of an equitable return. These points that I'd be getting wouldn't truly be their worth as their value is arbitrary. What happens is that contributing person is left empty handed every time..

Chinese Mandarin can be easy to learn, or it can be extremely difficult. It mainly depends on your sensitivity to the tones. If you have a good ear for tones, you will be able to distinguish them easily when you hear them, and mimic them in your speech with little effort. The flexible grammatical rules also make learning Mandarin pretty easy. But if you struggle with tones, both aurally and verbally, then you are going to struggle mightily to learn Mandarin, or any other tonal language. Reading Chinese is, of course, the biggest challenge to learning the language, no matter how good you are with tones. Chinese reading comprehension can be mastered by anyone, regardless of your aptitude for language, but you have to be willing to put in a lot of time, and a lot of repetition, to memorize the couple thousand characters needed for basic reading comprehension. It will definitely help to have a good visual memory. It a wonderful language, and I highly recommend that everyone with an interest give it a shot. The tones and pictographs may seem intimidating at first, but try a class for a semester or two, and see how it goes.
