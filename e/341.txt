The fact the potato cakes were rectangular and had the slashes is what has stayed in my memory. It was so unusual! And I seen latkes, hashbrowns, rsti, and croquettes but nothing like what I remember. The religious significance, now that was something I hadn ever considered! Both my grandparents were quite religious, so having a food made in honor of a saint feast day is well within the realm of possibility!.

This may take longer than you think it would. Like 5 10 minutes, just standing there, tossing rice until it is the right color, but this is the MOST CRUCIAL STEP. If you ever had bland, uninspiring, suspiciously uniformly yellow "fried" rice from some second rate Chinese joint in a strip mall, this is where it went wrong.

Next thing you know, fights started breaking out everywhere until it felt like the entire arena swinging and throwing shit. Gang violence was bad at that time (even in KC) so there that. The lineup was NWA, Ice T, Eric B and Rakim, MC Lyte and maybe Salt and Pepa.

I always see praise for this book, and I completely disagree, especially about the ending: It thought it was overly cheesy and saccharine.The book in general was not one of his best imo, there were parts that completely dragged (like a big section in the middle where Jake is staking out Lee Harvey Oswald by living near him) where I was having to force myself to keep reading because I was hoping it would get better.Overall I say this book is pretty overrated; it had an interesting premise and some good parts but the flaws were enough that I probably wouldn even recommend it to anyone.Same, but for the whole Sadie plotline, not just the ending.

(Shocker, I know,) But obviously your rational and understanding opinion is the one who needs to be considered here! I'll just go give myself the death you wished upon me now, a total random stranger who you know nothing about except my stance on one topic.

Most Pakistanis simply don believe that the Pakistani state is capable or willing to take on the criminal mafia, the extortionists and those carrying out targeted killings who are marking their ethnic territory with blood. Most Pakistanis also don believe that the MQM has a major problem with this mafia, these extortionists and these killers. The MQM virtual silence in the face of Mirza toxic onslaught is telling. If politics is like wrestling, the PPP has the MQM in a sleeper hold. But it must not mistake the sleeper hold for a kill shot. If it pushes too hard, it will only strengthen the MQM rock solid base of support in Karachi. If it doesn push at all, it will have to continue playing poker with the Raabita Committee of the MQM.
Bile however is extremely damaging to large intestine epithelium.When bile enters the small intestine via the common bile duct, beneficial bacteria break the bile salts down into a less toxic compound, making it non dangerous by the time it reaches the large intestine.When you take antibiotics you destroy these bacteria and the bile salts freely enter and damage the large intestine. I believe this contributes significantly to the high incidence of colon cancer plaguing today society.Beneficial bacteria also break down hormone secretions that are discharged from the liver to the small intestine.

Before you board, apply an even coating of a heavy duty moisturizer, which will seal hydration in and keep dry air and germs out. Ciraldo suggests a serum that contains lipids (such as her own Intense Replenishing Serum, $70 at ), or a thick drugstore formula like Aquaphor's.

Therefore the calls from Pence, Cantor, and McCain are not only just unhelpful, but they are a total gift to Ahmadinejad.Anyone who listened to coverage of the pro Ahmadinejad demonstrators yesterday could hear how they felt about Britian, where a long colonial relationship and PM Gordon Brown recent support of the Moussavi demonstrators has left Iranians with yet another reason to hate the Brits.

The film being released feels like "a fresh start" for Bloom. She says after her work on it was done, after she'd completed 200 hours of community service, she went back home.
1. President Jacob Zuma is stuck in a rock and a hard place. He has to face the fact that when he leaves power there is going to be a change of mentality within the ANC and possibly a cleansing of the rot within its caucus. If your Chief Whip, Deputy President, Stuggle Stalwarts and many other heavyweights are calling for his removal, then you know a cleaning out is coming soon. There is no way they will allow for another member of the Zuma camp to become the leader of the ANC. A reference should be made to that of Shaka Zulu. He ruled with tyranny and fear, just as Zuma is doing, but the result was that people within his own inner circle were the ones that ended his life. History is repeating itself here. Zuma is not scared of those speaking out against him, he is scared of the people within his own inner circle. They are following him because of fear and intimidation, but soon one of them will turn and the tide will change. Zuma's threat to the NEC was not to those speaking out, but those who are in his own camp contemplating to do the same as those already standing against him.

The rate of winning for a poker player is measured not in winning hand percentages, but rather something known as BB/100. This is the number of big bets won per 100 hands. Be careful though that the BB/100 rate tends to be higher for lower to micro limits games and not really a fair comparison.

What helped me was setting myself a period to try it out. I used fasting before Easter (without being religious, it was just convenient timing). It was hard, especially like week three or so, and afterwards I initially wanted to go back to eating meat. Did it three, four times and realised that I did not really need it, so I stopped ever since. To be honest, i wasn much of a vegetable eater before, this really transformed me and opened up more "new" dishes than it prevents me from eating. Before I always went for some kind of burger with fries, now I try many different things and it has been a real enrichment.

Yeah! This "everyone can get to this level if they just try" talk is a "well yeah but actually no" situation. You really gotta have the right mentality and learning attitude, and theoretically most people could learn this but a lot of people just get stuck at a certain point.

That's about the percentage you'll find in other United States gaming destinations.

Once all the victims pass away Japan can just pull the "they all dead" card and there be little Korea can do. The legitimacy of the cause and international support for it would largely disappear. All the horrors of the colonial era would just simply be treated as any other part of history. Korea can ask for reparations or an apology for the Imjin War because it happened nearly five hundred years ago and its victims are long dead. The same thing will happen to the victims of Japanese colonialism in a few years.

Quand on voit les Juifs disperss sur la terre, selon la parole de Dieu, on est surpris sans doute : mais pour tre frapp d'un tonnement surnaturel, il faut les retrouver  Jrusalem ; il faut voir ces lgitimes matres de la Jude esclaves et trangers dans leur propre pays ; il faut les voir attendant, sous toutes les oppressions, un roi qui doit les dlivrer.

The playerbase and total number of employees does not say anything about the number of reports they get per day or the number of employees they have for customer support.

In terms of real world application outside of theater, it is an excellent to be able to supplement the meager earnings of a freelance theater artist by working also as a draftsman.

Now on to the first point you raised, how much is being taken in. Well you can blame big tobacco for us not knowing that. See the vapor industry allows you to choose how many MG of nicotine you have per bottle/pod depending on the type of device you use. If you are using a traditional vape device than you will be able to find between 0 12mg of nicotine that will work well with the device. If you are using a refillable pod generally you can find between 25 50mg of salt nicotine (keep in mind the difference here. A traditional device creates more cloud per hit, meaning that while the mg count is lower, the amount you intake per hit is somewhat level with a pod, since the pod systems create far less vapor.)

A star weighing one tenth as much as the sun would produce so little energy that it would not be visible, and the largest planet, Jupiter, is already so small that it could not maintain nuclear reactions at all.

Huppert's resulting performance is a careful balancing act, one in which she refuses to soften the hard edges of the unpredictable lead character in a film that, as she notes, "gives you more hypotheses" than answers. "Certainly she's not afraid of going beyond certain limits," the actress says of Michle, whose most memorable line in the film may be, "Shame isn't a strong enough emotion to stop us doing anything at all." Endlessly complex, the Elle protagonist is, per Huppert, "a new heroine. She has the ways of overcoming whatever: her shame, her guilt." And observations that the actress makes about Michle could equally apply to Nathalie in Things to Come: "She's a solitary woman. She's fearless, also. That's what makes her interesting." Fearless: just like the actress herself.

That being said, a "social credit score" based on stuff like criminal history, payment history of loans and stuff like volunteering history is not inherently a bad idea.

No way the Chinese government is following strict data privacy ethics on these.

People with the highest activity levels were half as likely as inactive individuals to develop Alzheimer and were around 40% less likely to suffer any dementia or mental impairment, the report indicates. Previous research has suggested exercise helps people retain their mental prowess as they age, and may even stave off Alzheimer and other dementia. It has been suggested that because exercise helps maintain healthy blood flow and lowers high blood pressure and cholesterol, it may protect the brain just as it does the heart and other organs. The investigators found that the more activity the nearly 5,000 study participants reported at the study start, the less likely they were to suffer mental decline.
Take the time to understand your opponents and how they play. Keep notes on all of the opponents you face and develop their player profiles so you can use these notes in the future when facing them again and again. Uncover their tells as well as whether they play loose or tight. Utilize this knowledge of your opponents to prey upon their weaknesses. Pay attention to how frequently each player stays in the game to the River. By determining who the loose and weak players are you can focus your energy and time on defeating them first and use their stacks to help defend the better players.

In Othello you have also many patterns, but there is not that much literature about those patterns. It something you will have a hard time to actually describe. Some are easy to describe and to spot, some might be rare and hard to actually understand what is part of the pattern. Your head is constantly trying to match patterns in your everyday life. face recognition is just pattern matching. when you play you will try to remember what kind of moves have worked for you and which have not. So your mind will try to generalize the positions and that is pattern matching.

The goal is to eventually be playing 5/10 haha, just don't know where my skill stacks up and don't have the bankroll. I have a day job and all, so I'm not doing bankroll management out of necessity, but more as a challenge and "doing it proper". I wanted to start at 1/3 and try to see how far I could build a roll solely dedicated for poker. I actually just moved up to 2/5 a few weeks ago, because I like to buy in for the max and, as you know, both the 1/3 and 2/5 play much deeper than most casinos, so I didn't quite have the roll till recently. I was quite nervous at first, but after a few sessions, I've realized that 2/5 skill level isn't really that high and I've been doing well (yes I know, lol sample size). What are your thoughts on the 5/10 player pool/skill level compared to the 2/5?

At the same time I accept the fact that the mods cannot effectively truth police. They not government background checkers. So ultimately it a matter of the sub having become so popular that it started to eat itself with fiction. 
Just telling the story of what happened to me because I thought it was interesting enough and I really needed to get it off my chest. I know this kinds of things are hard to understand and even harder to believe when you have never experienced something like it, and also I am not stating that they are true or that you should believe in them either. Everyone has their own beliefs..

Have you ever talked to her about the stalking in the past, or some of the other hurtful things that happened growing up? Maybe it's not worth digging up stuff from the past right now, but it helps to get stuff off your chest in the long run, even if there is no resolution. Just telling your mom some of the ways she made you upset and having her hear you and acknowledge it can help to mend the relationship. An apology from her could help to steer the healing process in the right direction and even if she doesn't say she is sorry, you will probably feel better bringing these things to her attention when it's safe to say it and won't affect your living situation..

The firm has been advising Todd and her backers in Branson, Mo., from the outset.Todd's lawyer naturally says her amendment is legal, that arguments attacking it are incorrect or premature and that the amendment does NOT threaten existing gambling at the Southland and Oaklawn casinos. Why, that is not casino gambling, but electronic games of skill at existing parimutuel wagering facilities. Who could ever call slot machines, blackjack tables, poker rooms and digitized version of other casino games, well, casinos? Certainly, Southland and Oaklawn do not as a rule, except after a fashion in the brief opposing Todd's casino amendment.

It may be hard for us (with our parochial fondness for freedom and basic human rights) to understand such attitudes but it is not our business to judge and intervene.

I grew up and had kids of my own. I was doing the same thing to them without realizing it. One day I came home and caught my 14 year old daughter screwing around with a black kid. I threw him out of my house and beat him in my driveway. The cops were called and I went to prison for assault. In prison, I saw how ethnically divided everything was, but my counselor was the one who basically shook me out of it. She helped me realize that continuing this hatred would really only hurt my own life. I tried to avoid the racial groups in my prison. I stayed on my own and earned my GED. In my classes I met a lot of minorities who had also never graduated high school. I listened to my counselor and got to know them and realized what a hard life they had. Before, I thought that they were just lazy and sold drugs for easy money. We went through a lot of the same struggles in our education.

It wasn't until I watched Karley Sciortino's Viceland show where she explored why women in New York are in the same boat, that I stopped to wonder why Australian women don't have the option of paying someone to sort us out. Is it simply due to a lack of demand? Or is it because the female orgasm is a complex art intrinsically tied to an emotional connection? Perhaps it's less out in the open and everyone is, in fact, doing it and I'm just late to the party (much like laser hair removal, I'm still behind the eight ball on that one)..

It the same difference, essentially   duty is presumed as a matter of law, which is really a distinction without a difference, and the same as many negligence cases. I surprised you say causation is usually the sticking point, since it generally pretty obvious when a physical injury is involved, but ok. And I doubt anyone winning a case with no damages, whether they have to be "proved" as an element or not. The big issue is going to be breach, whatever name it goes by   whether the premises owner was acting reasonably or not.

If the anesthetic has high blood solubility, then you can dissolve a LOT of anesthetic in the blood before it becomes "saturated" and starts redistributing to the brain and fatty tissues. If the anesthetic has low blood solubility, then it rapidly saturates the blood and redistributes to brain/fat.

Its pretty much luck and either hand is fine. In the long run you would want threes every time, and you,d make .02% profit, but that amount of hands isn't possible and the profit is negligible. This of course doesn't include fold equity, along with many other factors.

Unless OP would prefer a rural placement, then they arguably better than most, but Interac is pretty much the same as JET in terms of placement.

I also remember a girl running home from youth group crying because she was wearing shorts. The pastor called her into his office to send her home from church.

If people came to my ministry naked I'd have thought "what a good job I'm doing"..

But it was nothing at all like Ghostbusters. That was a dumpster fire that constantly made me cringe at how bad it was, and wonder what kind of people thought they were making a movie that would be entertaining or amusing in any way.

Take rabies, for example. That virus developed a way to affect its host's behavior so that the host is highly motivated to transmit the virus to somebody else   through biting the living crap out of them. That seems like a winning strategy! So why don't all pathogens influence their host's behavior in a way that will make them want to get really close to another potential host? Why, for instance, don't sexually transmitted infections (STIs) boost our sex drive to make transmission pretty much guaranteed?. 
Gilles Marini: Well, what did you expect? Gilles was destined to dance the samba, wasn't he? Let's just say, there was no problem with hip action there.

General manager Emma Coleman told The Sunday Age the foundation had not produced a 2014 financial report because no donations were made to charities by the foundation that year. But the decision by the foundation to drop its confidentiality application led the ACNC to automatically publish the foundation annual report, which has been on file with the regulator for more than eight months. The 2014 documents show the foundation is in a worse financial position than it is currently publicly claiming. 
However, when playing a low limit game, the level of opponents frequently is quite low to play artlessly and quite winningly. Furthermore, special programs may help player to get some information about opponents online, so that less time may be occupied by personal analysis. Consequently, if you are armed with relevant software assistants (read below) and play better than most of your opponents, you may try to play more that one table simultaneously.

I understand your frustration and dislike, that your right as a matter of personal taste. I would just like to point out that IRL, there are many misleading, incorrect, over emphasized facts or discoveries that distract police investigations.

Ray Cummings (1887 1957) found a nice writing niche for himself in his fictional discovery of a drug that could make people as small as atoms and then, once inside the microworld, could be made as immense as micro mountains. The Girl in the Golden Atom was one of a five part trilogy(?)1 and so far as I can tell, Cummings used the hell out of his original idea. The prose reads like it is punctuated with invisible periods every fifth word evidently Cummings was so very busy writing 750 books and short stories that it left him little time to edit or, maybe,

It's hard to imagine the kind of obscure content a student would have to unearth for their pilfering to elude the sensors. But Turnitin clarifies how many kinds of theft fall under the plagiarism heading, and how sophisticated, and therefore difficult to catch, some of those kinds of theft can be. Turnitin refers to what it calls the Plagiarism Spectrum, an educational tool which "identifies 10 types of plagiarism based on findings from a worldwide survey of nearly 900 secondary and higher education instructors.". 
Psychological counselling (2 trials): these trials showed that psychological support appeared to be of benefit in terms of less patient depression, anxiety and negative attitude towards their condition, and to a lesser degree, to some physical symptoms of the condition. There are no CATs that have been shown to be unequivocally effective. There is some evidence that dietary linoleic acid may be of long term benefit for the physical symptoms of MS patients. Magnetic field therapy and neural therapy appear to have a short term ameliorative effect on the physical MS symptoms. Massage, bodywork and psychological counselling seem to improve depression, anxiety and self esteem felt by the patient. The literature search appeared to be thorough and no language restrictions were applied. Additional unpublished literature was also sought. The quality of the included studies was formally assessed, and the method and results are reported and discussed in the review.
Year one aligns with the standard university terms and does not extend into the summer holiday period. You will have one placement in first year, lasting four weeks, and you will also have Wednesday afternoons free.

This geographical aspect raises another possibility for the seeming lack of Celtic influence on English vocabulary; it may be possible that Old English speakers first came into contact with people who spoke a very Latinized "Lowland" dialect of Celtic that was distinct from what been described as "Highland" British Celtic, the parent language of modern Welsh, Breton Cornish, if Celtic languages were even present in the south east of England at all. Indeed, it seems likely that before the arrival of Old English, Latin developed in that area of England in much the same way it also did in Gaul, becoming widely adopted with Celtic dialects being spoken only in very marginal spaces..

I wrote a review on TrustPilot about how the dating service Tawkify was racist because they were in fact racist. I a mixed ethnicity and they refused to send me any dates except with Asian women. TrustPilot took down the review and said I wasn allowed to post a review using inflammatory language. The problem is I don know how else to describe what Tawkify was doing and how can anyone write a negative review without being inflammatory? No company is going to be happy about a negative review. All negative reviews are inflammatory by nature so does that mean they don allow negative reviews? Later I found out that TrustPilot allows companies to pay for positive reviews and it all made sense. The whole purpose of TrustPilot is simply an advertising channel.
I can buy the argument of having different base movement speed being "confusing" for new players. What I don understand is why every (mana dependent) hero gets to start with a mana pool of 500.

Boughner's research had suggested to him that a flashier casino would roil the Atlantic City market   and bring big profits to its owner. "Every level of the market, from the bluest of collar to the whitest, was ready to trade up. But every operation in Atlantic City had commoditized itself. There was nothing distinctive about any of them. The market was junk that hadn't been reinvented since the '80s. The last new project was 1990. That was great for us   easy pickings."

Well I can answer that, because I can even be sure that you are conscious. I not sure that I not just alone out here surrounded by automated robots existing along pre defined tracks. BUT if I am alive and conscious, then it is due to a series of successful hallucinations created to further my body and allow me to live longer and reproduce. Seriously. If you have not done hallucinogenic drugs before then you can begin to comprehend the idea of it. As soon as you have done them, you understand that your consciousness is just the simplest and most logical of possible hallucinations in the world and there exists (likely) a series of billions of other people walking around in some crazy bizarre reality that is almost identical to your understanding and not quite parallel to your actions.
The kicker to this story is 2 days after I get my refund, I receive a call from the owner of the home that the package was delivered to. Husband had seen the item on their lawn (large garden box) and assumed wife had ordered it. He's on his way north to camp and just sticks it in garage.

In itself the book had no literary merit; Captain Jim's charm of storytelling failed him when he came to pen and ink; he could only jot roughly down the outline of his famous tales, and both spelling and grammar were sadly askew. But Anne felt that if anyone possessed of the gift could take that simple record of a brave, adventurous life, reading between the bald lines the tales of dangers staunchly faced and duty manfully done, a wonderful story might be made from it.

In effect, the decline thesis paradigm placed the Ottoman Empire outside of normal history. Normal states don "rise and fall" in some kind of set pattern, they just. exist. They react to historical processes and adapt to them over time. This is where a lot of confusion comes from regarding what exactly "decline" means. "The decline thesis" was a paradigm, whereby the very story of Ottoman history itself was that of this rise and decline. "The Ottoman Empire was in decline" did not simply mean, as is sometimes imagined, "the Ottoman Empire military strength and economic vitality decreased in relation to its neighbors." Rather, it meant that every aspect of the empire history was conceptualized within this framework. It not that the empire just got weaker, but that the nature of the empire and its place in world history centered around this idea of decline and decay. Nobody wanted to talk about, for example, the growth of international trade and economic boom of the eighteenth century, except to connect it to later European dominance of the Ottoman economy. The decline thesis proposed that all that mattered about Ottoman history in its later centuries was the story of how the empire became weaker and ultimately vanished. Nowadays, we want to write a history that actually tells us what was going on in the empire at the time. Not just, "how did the growth of international trade contribute to the empire later weakness?" but "how did the growth of international trade impact contemporary Ottoman society?"

I allow myself some time to dwell, because self pity is a bit cozy for short periods, and I believe there is learning to be had in the process of dwelling, but throughout that process I remind that life "is what it is", and that all there is to it. There are infinite choices in life, none of which allow us to see into the future beforehand. You can punish yourself even though it illogical to do so (even though we all do, sometimes), but then you can choose to face the fact that it not in our nature to make perfect decisions all the time. it is, in fact, impossible. Feel the burn of regret, then walk through it like the temporary thing it is.

The problem comes with Baylor vs the other playoff contenders and trying to compare their strength of schedules. To me, I would rank Utah and Clemson above Baylor if we looking at teams they have played (both Clemson and Utah have 10 P5 games scheduled compared to Baylor 9). And here where it really comes into play. Given Utah, Clemson, Baylor, OSU, and LSU all go undefeated, who would you say deserves the playoff spots? Utah (11 P5 wins), Clemson (11 P5 wins), Baylor (9 P5 wins), OSU (10 P5 wins), and LSU (10 P5 wins). I would easily leave Baylor out because it doesn matter that they put up 70 on Rice and Kansas, their schedule doesn come close. And I can guarantee you that if UCLA wins out the rest of the year and wins the PAC 12 I would put them in the playoffs over an undefeated Baylor.

In poker our tight player gets dealt a pair of aces. This is what he has been waiting for and he comes out guns blazing. On the flop there might be some dangerous cards   such as 2 of the same suit   indicating that another player could have a flush draw. Another card with the same suit comes on the turn. But he ignores this and continues to bet. At the river the opponent turns over a 2,3 suited to the 3 table cards and wins with a low flush. Our ACES man is devasted. He had the much higher hand before the flop  it doesn seem fair! But poker is about the cards both now and in the future.

Your comment was removed, but for your future and information  it is very common for abused children to literally wipe memories. It's a survival skill as a child, and it shows up in brain scans. There are blocks between the short and long term memory storage for a lot of us. If reminded, I can pull up some of the memories but otherwise they actually disappear. One of the reasons I wrote down the worst of my Mom's abuse was because I would literally forget incidents unless reminded. That's the joy of neuroplasticity in children  they will literally re wire their brains to survive abuse but it messes with you as an adult.

In a cash game you may or may not turn over your cards. When all five cards are on the board the person who went all in is first to act. The other people in the hand following the person who went all in may or may not show their cards. It is up to them. It is common for people with losing hands to still turn over their cards, but not required. Some players will turn their cards over before all of the cards are on the board, but it is not required.

It kind of like building a complicated LEGO kit. The page will tell you "You will need these bricks" so you get them. Then it tells you "put this brick next to this brick and this brick next to this brick." When you run out of pages for that part, you done. Go on to the next page which begins the next part. Then it says, "Those parts that you assembled from bricks? Get those parts, and then put them together like this, and you need these bricks to hold them together." It might even say, "You will need some of part X. Go to page 10 for instructions on how to build part X. Build 5 of part X. Then come back to this page for how to put those five part Xs together to make part Y." You might get confused and try to build a part you don need. You can build that part, so you ignore it and go on to the next one. You might have already build 6 of part X instead of 5, so you have an extra, and this other part needs those bricks. So you break down that extra one and use those bricks for the part that you do need.
