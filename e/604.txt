It not as easy as some of you are making it sound. You have to get your car registered to someone with a valid DL otherwise the second a cop runs your plates you done for. In my state they impound your car and tack on more time to your revocation. Then it escalates to a felony and your ass can go to prison for it. It a massive deterrent and just because some people do it anyway doesn mean it isn effective. And it not like we can physically prevent someone without a DL from driving a car, so I not sure why so many people are just stating the obvious fact that some people choose to break the law anyway.
I used to go to a Korean middle school so physical punishment for any bad behavior was expected. One day a few kids were talking in class so our ass of a math teacher decided that we somehow all deserved to get punished. He told us to kneel on our desks and started hitting us on the thigh one by one. We all complained but figured we just get it done with and get back to class. But one of my classmates completely snapped. He pulled out a knife from his pocket(idek why he had one) and put it towards the teachers throat and threatened to kill him. At that moment I was genuinely afraid I was about to witness a murder and was scared but for some reason every single one of my classmates was laughing at this situation. I still don understand why. But thankfully there was no murder;the kid just ran off to the front office bc he realized he fucked up and came back begging for forgiveness.

Bluffing is just a nice word for lying. What you're attempting to do is to either completely conceal your emotions so that no one can tell what it is you're feeling, or (and this is a lot harder) give a false impression of your feelings. The goal is to throw your opponents at the table off to either let them think they're going to win (when you have a good hand) or to make them think they're going to lose (when you have nothing worth playing). It isn't an easy skill to pick up, but for those who find that acting comes naturally to them it is a skill that can make you a fantastic card player. Just don't overdo it. hamming it up at the table will cost you just as if you were hamming it up on stage.

All modern voseo conjugations derive from Old Spanish second person plural  ades,  edes,  ides, and  odes (as in sodes, "you are"). Around the middle of the fifteenth century, these conjugations changed, with  ades >  is,  edes >  s  s,  ides >  s, and  odes >  is. Soon analogous forms  s,  is came into use. This is where the variety of forms the contemporary American voseo adopts, most varieties have a generalized monophthong, some a generalized diphthong (Venezuela), and a few combining monophthongs and diphthongs, depending on the conjugation (Chile). In the most general, monophthongized, conjugation paradigm, a difference between voseo and tuteo can only be heard in the present indicative, imperative and subjunctive, and, most of the time but not always, in the preterite. vos gained the oblique and possessive forms of t and its old forms are now only used in modern Spanish for Castilian vosotros. Interested, but off topic, a very different, yet similar, change with pronouns happened in Portuguese.
Fast forward to yesterday massage, I made a same day evening appointment for 45 minutes with him again since I was feeling extremely tense.

I've tried phentermine before. My doctor said he hadn't met someone with the same issue as me before. That being said I didn't feel the side effects (sweating, increased heart rate, increased body temp, jittery) of phentermine past the 2nd day. By the 3rd day I didn't really feel any appetite suppression. By the 5th day I built a tolerance to where it was like I didn't even take it. Lol. I might try take phentermine 2 3 days at a time with a break in between. Thinking of eating 1500cal/day while off phentermine and 1200/cal or possibly less on the 2 or 3 days on it. My doctor basically said do whatever works for me.
Destructor switches. As he later recalled, he reached for them and then changed his mind: first he must position himself to eject. Like other pilots, Powers was leery of ejection seats.

Although it is not recorded, someone got the bright idea of loading the mine cars with people and pushing them down the hill. The 'ride' became an instant success. The track was used for coal mining during the day, and as a pleasure ride at night. To make life easier, the mules were replaced by a steam engine that would haul the empty cars up a longer but more gradual incline to the top of the mountain. This helped efficiency by having a motorized means to keep empty cars coming up, on a separate track, while coal was being transported down the main track. Soon both tracks became part of the Mauch Chunk Scenic Railway. People paid $1 to ride up on the incline (motorized track), then the engines were removed, and they were sent back down the main track, with just gravity to push them along.

Sindhi landlord Bijarani is a PPP stalwart accused of presiding over a jirga in 2007 that offered five minor girls as compensation in a murder dispute. The Supreme Court ordered his arrest after a case was brought against him by a women's rights activist. He remained free, Musharraf undertook a little bit of judicial spring cleaning shortly afterwards and according to a story in the international press Bijarani has since claimed to have been acquitted of all charges by a lower court in his own province. This questionable but undoubtedly convenient approach to luxuries like legality might be a great way for the apex court to clear its backlog. So of the moment hesitate politico Zehri made headlines earlier this year when he defended in parliament the 'tribal traditions' behind the burying alive of teenage girls for seeking to marry men of their own choice.

Saying that preflop solutions by snowie based on the potsize are the be all end all of GTO no limit is ridiculous. The theory shifts depending on the strategies being used. Say I open 51% on the button, sb should adapt his 3b strategy to my open, as bb increases his % in cold4betting. NLH isn solved (yet) so preflop solutions, especially by snowie which advocates cold calling 3bets which is ridiculous in practice, are very susceptible to changes in the metagame. Even this pack doesn account for different opening sizes or different 3b/4b sizes. Your decision making is based on an AI that plays against itself with no variables in it ranges or sizings and you simplify that outcome to the ultimate poker strategy and everything that different is wrong. The best way to learn is get monkersolver or piosolver edge, punch in the ranges used by the villains and use that result to construct a counter strategy, which shoves TT+ in a standard 200 zoom pool reg vs reg vs reg spot. You are letting white make a flower and even get a sente. I would play P3. This is the hard part of go. But since you are already losing at this point, this could be fine.

On your tracking sheet (or Excel file), add $4 elsewhere so you can make the most of that extra dollar or two. Likewise, if you paid $42 for Lindor in the above example, you need to be more budget conscious and cut $2 from your shopping list elsewhere to keep the books balanced.

Okay I did a very small Google search and from my understanding as a biology major, even though some protein may be denatured through the intense heat from cooking, these denatured proteins are still amino acids. These will still make it into your body and be absorbed. Our bodies break down the other proteins, and still absorb the same amino acids. It just an extra step to break those folded proteins down.
Perhaps any or all of those issues can be overcome, but that often requires a couple of things that can be extremely hard to come by for poor people   time, money, and stability.

To his credit, Matt Smith does a solid job portraying the photographer, leaning into Mapplethorpe's lifestyle and never shying away from the shittier aspects of his personality. It's refreshing to see the silver screen spin on the life of a genius balanced with the truth about what a prick said genius could be. That said, Smith's performance doesn't do enough to make this movie worth the time. You'd be better off diving into Just Kids and getting the story and a better version at that straight from the source.
No chops means if 2 players go into a hand where it'll be chopped half the time, lets say 85% tie before the flop is run they agree to chop it and both take half the pot back. A good example of this would be Ace King of Spades vs Ace King of Hearts. The main reason poker players like to chop pots is because they don't want to get it in on a coinflip   poker is about getting the smallest edge possible. Getting it in a 60% favourite consistently instead of getting it in a 50% favourite in the longrun the 60% will always come out on top. (Full Answer)

It is a very walkable campus. I had my car for the past two years because I stayed here during the summer and needed it to get to work (Atlanta public transit is nonexistent) but it is not necessary during the semester at all, merely a luxury. Atlanta public transit is only "non existent" to those up north (and maybe those from large cities outside of the US) who outright dismiss it. When I was there, it was very good to me and pretty easy unless I was in a very disconnected suburb which was rare. Gold and Red are heavily used by folks who work in the 3 4 major financial districts). It can definitely be far better, but is nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be, and is certainly far better than every other large southern metro area, including Houston (just recently getting light rail, otherwise only bus) and Dallas (has lots of lightrail no one rides). Give Atlanta some credit where it is due. It is the only truly southern city whose population has seriously bought into "smart growth" and serious development and improvement of public transport.

People in this country need to learn that opening yet another generic food service business without any expertise or market research is a retarded idea. All these uncompetitive businesses that refuse to innovate and only manages to stay afloat by paying their employees slave wages need to die. Koreans need to allocate capital to firms that look to compete globally, there are way too many people looking to sqeeze pennies out of this tiny, oversaturated domestic market. Unskilled labour deserve to be unemployed, and any money allocated to them by slaving away at failing cafe 4393764 is wasted. A min wage hike solves all these problems and forces unskilled laborers and complacent union workers to either make themselves competetive or die trying.

There are lots of pretty maps floating around social media colored various shades of green that give you the idea that at any moment the whole country is going to flip to legalization, but when you sift out all the states that have legalized but regulated away any practical use, you left with just the 3 or 4.

Edit: wow, some real interesting discussions spawned from this post! I just want to clarify that I really love the fashion and comradery among Korean men, and I really wish America would get over its hyper masculinity trip and adopt more progressive male behaviors. It just that I also have LGBT Korean friends as well, and it breaks my heart to see them go through as much hardship as they do. If you defining metrosexual as concerned about looks/well groomed, into fashion, don care about wearing make up or platform shoes.
Thank you! That's exactly how I would describe Philomena a few years ago, but it really grew on me after the film and the song by the same name (the film features evil nuns indeed, though Philomena is the woman whose child was taken away by these nuns; and the song is by The Decemberists, the sweetest dirty song I know).
Yeah, it the most generic fantasy setting that I ever seen. Carbon copy of Tolkien with some of that post GoT edge. Any fantasy with elves and dwarves that not part of AD or Tolkien automatically gets a "are you fucking KIDDING ME STOP WITH THIS SHIT" but couple that with the Gary Stu, immortal gorgeous sex god main character, the adolescent male power fantasy run amok main character, and it just absolutely un fucking bearable. 
So yea I could totally see a billionaire making that trip for a handy..

Yep. Simply put, I went back to reading books I actually liked instead of only what I thought I "should be reading." When I was 6 9, I could plow through a Babysitters Club/Goosebumps/Sweet Valley High book in an hour. As an adult, it turns out that I really into literary thrillers, suspense, and books set in Southern California, both fiction and non. I read all of Joan Didion and Eve Babitz books in about a week. When I discovered Donna Tartt and Gillian Flynn and Megan Abbott and Patricia Highsmith, I plowed through everything they written like it was a new Sweet Valley High spin off and I was 10 years old again. I poured one out for the years I spent bouncing off the serious contemporary literature I felt like I "had" to read in order to be taken seriously by the men I was dating (you know exactly what I talking about   DFW, Pynchon, Franzen, Ishiguro) and went right back to finding more stuff along the lines of what I actually like.

Did she ever reply to the email he sent her? She sent a lot of messages about why she didn reply to the email, but it seems like she never actually replied in a way that shows that she understood what was being said and what she did to cause this rift. A letter about forgiveness is meaningless if she doesn have any concept of what she asking to be forgiven for. I hope your DH at least goes over her bullshit before letting her back into his life.

At 12, 3, 6, and 9 (repeat) we fed both babies, changed diapers, swaddled, rocked and put back to sleep. If they woke up and cried at other times we fed/changed/soothed back to sleep and then woke them up at the scheduled time as well. Pretty quickly the babies got in to the same routine.

Ask your girlfriend to choose which massage oil or lotion she would want you to use. Apply an ample amount of this to the palms of your hand and rub together to create enough heat. Then rub your palms on your girlfriend's back while she's lying down on her belly. Ask your girlfriend if the pressure your are putting on her back is enough or if you need to add more. Start massaging her back using slow, solid strokes. Move from her back to her shoulders and then to her lower back. To massage this area of her back, it is best to use your thumbs. Once you're done massaging her back, cover the area with a sheet.

I don know how many people get it, but what been described in these threads is common for those who been raped/assaulted. There no playbook out there on how you supposed to respond to shit like this. People just end up doing their best not to lose their entire sense of safety, and that frequently involves trying to make sense of the initial assault in a manner that allows you to keep living your life without totally falling apart.
I appreciate him because often times people are like oh he unrealistic or he just shooting for something that will never happen. But if we didn have visionaries or people who want to achieve the "unreachable" then how can great change ever occur? If we keep doubting, then it will never happen and things CAN be better than they are now, we just have to work at it. I appreciate him so much because he makes that vision at least a little easier to see in our future.
Also cheers for the silver my dude. :)

Also, I really didn care for the Guardians movies. They were just too goofy for me, they were OK, but still some of my least favorite Marvel movies. Then the Guardians were some of the best parts of Infinity War, great comedy lines and action scenes and they were integral to the plot, I loved them there.

Dhoni has been a notoriously slow starter in T20 cricket of late, but he teed off right away on Wednesday night.

We started off with the basic shower, where the girl cleans you from head to toe and then sends you to the bed. She then gave me a skillful if not strong Nuru massage. I don much like oil massage but Nuru is water soluble, odourless and naturally dissolves on its own, so you get the nice slip slide massage without ending up sticky, and when the gel wears off you can feel natural, bare skin.

The primacy of meat for muscle building goes further: There's evidence that there is something about "the meat itself" that yields maximal muscle gains. A classic study that compared muscle development from a hypertrophy style training program in omnivores and vegetarians who ate the same macronutrient ratios showed that the meat eaters gained 4 percent muscle mass and lost 6 percent fat mass, while increasing Type II fiber area by 9 percent. The vegetarian group experienced no noticeable changes in muscle mass or body fat percentage..

However, solvers are very, very useful to help choose proper bluff candidates and help understand range vs. range interaction on certain boards. I also found that just the work of setting up the tree and the critical thinking required to interpret and simplify outputs improves my understanding of the game greatly, which has improved my results both online and live. But the only reason these guys are at that level is because the competition forces them to do so and it sink or swim. Unfortunately, the truth is as a live player you going to always be behind the progression of the game simply because your competition is weak (compare with Stars NLz pools) and you going to prefer playing and printing your hourly over solver work. People using solvers effectively aren using them to follow the equilibrium strat exactly, and the ones that are usually give up as its an overwhelming futile approach. Equilibrium, even pseudo equilibrium that a solver provides, is way too complicated to follow exactly. Despite this, using solvers to craft your strategy is a worthwhile endeavor. As you work more and more in a solver, patterns emerge. You develop an instinctive feel for how you should play and how villain should play given the range v. range interaction. As you start to see how far we deviate from equilibrium, your nodelocking work should help you understand how to best counter your opponents.
One of them was the blurry wallpaper in the drawer thing, which is the one that annoyed me the most. Not just because they didn want to implement it, but because they had tons of excuses that it literally impossible to do; that all the launchers that do do it do it wrong and stupidly and slow down your device to shit and so on. There was a new excuse with every new launcher that had that feature.

Magnesium may also elicit itsantidepressanteffects by acting as an inorganic antagonist of N methyl d aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor function (Poleszak et al., 2007).

NMDA receptors, which occur on the surface of nerve cells, are activated in part by glutamate, one of the excitatory amino acids in the brain..

Because those are detected via different methods. Exoplanets are typically detected when they pass in front of their star (relatively speaking from our point of view). These infrequencies in light coming from the star can be used to discover them and gain some insights on their size and other characteristics. Planets on very long orbital trajectories in our solar system are significantly harder to detect. They can pass between us and the sun, they are too far away and don reflect enough light to find them visually. They are mostly detected by irregularities in other planets orbits. Basically when a planets orbit (like Neptune) has irregularities in it orbit that aren conform with our current model of our solar system. So like in this case we assume there must be a mass (undetected planet) that is causing this effect.

Every casino is a giant Skinner Box that records and analyzes the behavior of patrons. That's how we've learned to only use smaller denomination chips during payouts. So if you win, say, a thousand bucks, instead of giving you one $1,000 chip, we'll give you 10 $100 chips, because the human brain doesn't really understand the value of objects.

One thing that does help for me is using memory bands, are you familiar with them? They coloured bands; you could use hair ties or thin leather bracelets, or really anything which is easy to slip onto the wrist. When I have something cooking and I need to leave the room, I will put on a red band, and when I need to stop at the market, I will put on a green band. Every time I have my wrist in my line of sight, I say to myself, kitchen or market. Eventually my brain will prompt me on its own, because it habit to repeat the word when my eyes see the band.

For some, the accusation served as a warranted condemnation, while others questioned the rush to decry Ansari for a regretful, but ultimately consensual, encounter. Considering the introspective nature of Ansari's comedy, it seems certain that he will continue to reflect on the event in his work.

Graham and Buffett were famous for beating the market over long periods of time by buying cheap stocks.
