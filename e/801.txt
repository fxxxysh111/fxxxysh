But, in this modern and unarguably unsustainable economy, there is a strong correlation between the amount of money spent on something, and the CO2 emissions required to build that thing from scratch, with a few exceptions (buying a forest to preserve it, investing in steadily improving next generation solar and battery technologies). Even though this house is made of wood, it took a lot of oil to make it, and given the deciduous trees, a lot of coal and methane leaking "natural" gas is required to heat this house. 2 points  submitted 19 days ago

Communication Skills Massage therapists must communicate well with their clients. They need to know the client's problem, her medical history, what symptoms she is experiencing and what results she expects from treatment. Massage therapists need active listening skills, giving clients their full attention and taking the time to comprehend what they are actually trying to say.

I needed a recipe like this because of my gardening endeavors. I wanted a reliable supply of greens for consumption during the Summer, but it seemed nice to also have an end product for the Winter. Beets have delicious greens, and so so roots. The lightbulb went on in my head when I conceived of combining a supply of beets with a taste for chocolate cake. Magically, it worked! I usually find ways of making a cake sweet by using fruit instead of sugar. I always use wholewheat flour. The recipe might work okay with white flour instead. Dry Ingredients1/2 tsp1  cinnamon3 or 4 tbsps2 of cocoa powder3 or 4 tbsps of chocolate bits1 cups of wholewheat flour (or about 350ml)3 tsps of nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts, etc)2 tbsps of rolled oats2 tsps of baking powder3 tsps of powdered milk1/2 cup of raisins

I don have fond childhood memories of "that house in terrible condition with a wretched yard," but maybe I missed out on that part of childhood somehow? I lived on a compound with standard maintenance done by a specific company, and there was a ton of green space we all ran around in together, and every single house looked different. It was pretty cool. These days my parents live in a house in an HOA, right alongside a golf course, and they delighted that they can just pay a monthly fee and not have to worry about landscaping or any of that sort of maintenance and still get to look at nice plants all the time. It works out pretty well for them.

The E43 makes generous use of sound deadening materials as well as acoustic laminated glass. The result is a near silent cabin at just about any speed. The interior also offers next level luxury that will leave many competitors in panic. Everything from the buttons to the speaker grills to even the air vents look and feel like decadence. The open pore wood trim that sweeps around the cabin is accented with soft LED lighting that comes in endless colours. The multi contour Nappa leather seats feel fantastic and offer many features, including active side bolsters and several soothing massage settings. Short of spending six figures on something ultra high end, I can't think of another interior that's quite so opulent.

At the last house show I went to, there was this guy in an Undertaker "respect the flag" shirt in front of me who knee jerk hated all the black wrestlers on the roster. He got mad that they played the WM32 women's triple threat before the show because Sasha was in it and heckled at the screen the whole time like it was a live match. He booed the New Day every second they were out there and tried to counter every single New Day chant he heard. Hell, he even acted like seeing Titus O'Neil in a video package for three seconds was this big personal inconvenience for him. If he only did one of those things, I might have been able to write it off as a coincidence, but the pattern was too strong to be anything other than racism on this guy's part.

Somebody had executed both men. My grandfather said his captain was furious, and was determined to discover who did it but there were no witnesses. The rumors pointed to a new lieutenant in their unit who had been nearby. The same man died in the Korean conflict years later, and my grandfather decided he earned an early trip to hell for the crime. It was a haunting event for a close knit unit who had grown to mostly trust and respect one another.

Cameron Rayner: The 2017 number one draft pick played 22 games in his debut season last year, where he averaged 13.5 disposals a game and kicked 20 goals whilst finishing inexplicably 7th in the NAB Rising Star.

The other major mission showing the combat system occurred later in campaign. It dealt with a guy who goes by the name Bedbug. Aiden needed to isolate him, so he can flip him into an ally.

Suppose the rats are euthanized when their health starts to deteriorate, so they get close to 1 QALY per year. This would cost about $5 per rat per month plus an opportunity cost of maybe $500 per month for the time spent, which works out to another $5 per rat per month. Thus creating 1 rat QALY costs $120 per year, which is $240 per human QALY per year..

The thing is, the entire store was almost identical to any of the ones that you find in the United States. The layout was the same (albeit mirrored from the one I usually visit, which I chalked up to being one of those driving on the wrong side of the road things), all of the sections were eerily familiar, and many of the expected products were present.

Anger and resentment will fuel all future actions, if they lucky. Suicide if they are not.

My understanding is that the visible light spectrum is somewhere around 400 800nm like you said but the sun also puts off infrared light which extends well past that, up in the hundreds of thousands of nm  but the higher the wavelength in nm it drops off quite a bit like is shown at this link:Near infrared light is contained within the spectrum of natural sunlight. In fact, sunlight that reaches the earth's surface contains 52% to 55% near infrared light. It's clear that humans and other animal and plant species, by Nature's design, have been programmed to utilize near infrared light to our benefit.

Non Turnover RevenueAlthough much of your company's revenue will probably be generated by turnover of products through sales, you can also bring in revenue through other channels, such as services. If you run a massage business, the work you do doesn't really deplete any asset that needs to be replenished, or turned over. If your company earns interest or royalty income, these sums also have little to do with turnover..

About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes   a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight. But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic   their irises are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.

First, you can talk to your BF. You can show him some of her texts. You can tell him that it hurt to think that her irrational belief that your cooking ability was a slap in the face to her meant that you could no longer share something you loved to share with his family. You can let him know that, from your POV, it feels as though, despite the fact that she has been actively unkind to you, and told outright lies about you to his brother and his family, you are the one who is being made to feel as though you are in the wrong, and how much that hurts.

This strategy can also be useful for estate planning if you wish to maximize the amount available to your heirs by lowering your tax bill on death. For example, for someone in a lower  or middle income tax bracket, it may make sense to strategically withdraw more than the mandatory minimum annual amount from your RRIF. These withdrawals might be taxed at lower rates while you alive, rather than have the entire fair market value of your RRIF (or RRSP, for that matter) taxed as income in the year of death (absent a tax deferred transfer to a surviving spouse or partner). With combined federal/provincial tax rates as high as 54 per cent in some provinces, that could mean less than half of your RRSP/RRIF goes to your beneficiaries upon your death. Any pension income that qualifies for the federal pension income credit (above) also qualifies to be split.

This cycle would repeat until there are about 100 men under 18 and 400 500 men over 18, with women staying at 1500. So the ratio would just by pure demographics start to shift towards men, which would put even more stress on the birth rate since you have to kill off an ever increasing number of men. If you did however start to kill off more and more unborn penis having fetuses, you eventually end up with the average age of men increasing by an incredibly amount since each generation has less and less men. 
Ha! You think dementia patients with no close relatives were safe from doctors who made killing part of their profession? Doubt it. And even if they were, there no compassion points awarded if you murdering some people while helping others.

So unless you are doing something proactive like research or networking that will directly benefit you when it comes to making these sales calls Etc, but most of your focus and energy on distracting yourself away from those things when you are not at work where you were trying to just relax at home so that way you are not constantly dedicating your mental energy to a task you don even have to do for another day or two.

It not that every single MLM has products that are inherently terrible, it the way they scam their huns and then encourage further scamming, and also lie about curing illnesses or weight loss which takes advantage of the vulnerable at best, and encourages poor mental and physical health at worst.

I not sure why but I find it really interesting that Bill was one of the first members members of the gang but it doesn get brought up much, if at all. Arthur and Grimshaw will talk a bit about "the old days" when you play Poker, and we know that John and Arthur have known each other for about 15 years, but you don hear much about Bill from back in the day. The only thing I can think of is an encounter I had in chapter six where Bill finds Charles and John standing together and starts berating them for being disloyal   Charles for being "trouble since you got here" and John for being "nothing but a street rat when Dutch found you", implying that Bill was in the gang before John was..

So in the Mideast at that time, polygamy was legal and normal (still is in some parts of the Islamic world), and the point of a marriage was status or alliances. Mohamed did indeed have a 9 year old bride, but it wasn because he was into boinking 9 year old girls. In fact, she lived in her mother house until she hit puberty. When she did hit puberty, then her purpose was to produce heirs, just like in any Christian pairing of a young man with a 12 13 year old girl.

Reduplication seems to be fairly prevalent in Hawaiin as a way to form new words. Simply put, reduplication is the process of repeating a word to change its meaning. For example, in English, we might say that a dog is "super super cute," reduplicating super to emphasize the word. In Hawaiin, they appear to use reduplication to create new words. For example, Wikipedia notes that the word which means "to swim," spawned, through reduplication, the word which means "to bathe."
There are many effects of sport massage. These are divided into two categories: physical and mechanical and physiologicalTissue Permeability Massage improves the absorption of substances within the body tissues. Deep massage causes the pores in tissue membranes to open; this enables fluids and nutrients to pass through.

Before it is of much use, crude oil must be processed into petroleum products, and this is where refineries come in. So back to our martini example: During the refining process, the vodka becomes a martini as other ingredients get mixed in   or crude oil becomes gas. Price is affected here because there are different formulas and quality standards to adhere to. A branded station   think Exxon or BP   can only buy its contracted brand of gasoline, which boasts a special recipe. An unbranded station, Sheets or Costco, buys basic, wholesale gasoline, which makes it cheaper, but leaves the station with a less guaranteed supply.

How is pointing out the facts of our divorce culture and courts misogynistic? I also never said anything about unhealthy dangerous relationships. I was pointing out increases in no fault divorce. You are literally using straw man tactics to create arguments that I never brought up or tried to disagree with. Of course those are major issues and that we need to continue making it easier for women and men to both leave abusive relationships. I apologise for making it unclear that I was meaning normal relationships that are not identified as abusive but please don shove a bunch of notions that I never mentioned to try and paint me as some misogynist. If you want to argue then argue the points I brought up not by throwing a bunch of very sensitive topics that I never mentioned to paint me as something I not. Please describe how pointing out the current reality of our divorce culture is misogynistic.

I made it a point to never use the code unless it was absolutely required. It was rarely needed since more often than not the professors didn't even really use anything from it outside the hard copy book itself so I was able to re sell the book with a still valid code online for a little less than the bookstores. Only one time that I can recall was the code even used for a course because that particular bundle contained our labs, quizzes, and tests. Something to consider if you're stuck buying those bundles, don't activate the code until it's required of you. You may never end up needing it and can then re sell.

Normally if that is the case, the two leads for the capacitor are both colored the same and different from any of the other wires, brown being the most popular color for two dedicated capacitor leads. My guess is this is a single phase motor with two to cap, two to power, and one is a frame or chassis ground, three phase with capacitor is rare and normally if a cap is used for a three phase motor, it is in a separate "box" the cap is used to form a "false" third leg and is used to create rotation, but is of little use past beginning rotation, these setups should be used with caution as the motor HP is usually derated by a significant factor, example 1/2 horse three phase with false third leg, may only be powerful enough to operate less than half the rated horsepower on a legitimate three phase power supply. Again most likely two are for a capacitor, one is common, the other two are either speed choices with common, or reverse with common.

You get a delta because I am now realizing my ideas of what strong men look like are equally distorted, based on the difference between bodybuilder muscularity and functional muscularity. I looked at some photos of rock climbers and MMA people. Yeah, you can tell it more about strength to weight ratio than about packing on muscle, like 300 would indicate..

Was it over the GFM or the visa being posted? I kept seeing people say the visa, but I suspect it another GFM. If that the case, people should direct any negativity at Kreeny. Pole should have expected that given S6 penchant for GFMs. Not to mention he had a few already. Pole is the biggest grifter there is. He always begging for shit. None of us knocked Kreeny up (3x at that).

I would like to see the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and a complete transfer of responsibility for the Palestinian population from Israel to the Palestinian state. In addition, the new Palestinian state must recognise Israel as a Jewish state and give up any claims of its land such as the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Israel will of course withdraw completely (or with land exchange) from the West Bank.

As a sector as a whole, it hard to overstate just how important gambling is to the Irish economy in general. For example, by 2020 it anticipated that it will employ between 2,000 and 3,600 people with a payroll of million so it would make sense for the government to do all they can to stimulate its growth. 
But I say that, since we don have any military elite in our society anymore, it would be a lot harder for the Bunderwehr to be abused in domestic affairs. 
Why are Lala's hand bags never that seasons or even from that years line? Gucci slides are $250! Rand lives in a $1.2m home that was mortgaged and he still owes over $1m on. They are likely never moving because I doubt he'd get that high of a mortgage again. 
Over one hundred years ago we got around by sitting in a box with wheels that was pulled by horses. Sometimes these boxes, known as stagecoaches, went through dangerous areas where bad people wanted to steal whatever was inside the box with wheels. So the person sitting next to the person making sure the horses went where they were supposed to, called the driver, would sit with a shotgun..

When Weidman beat Gastelum, it was clearly because Gastelum is too small for MW, and definitely has nothing at all to do with Weidman being a champion caliber fighter.When a fighter who moved up gets a win, it clearly a fluke against an over the hill trash tier fighter.

We registered for the simple fact that we knew people were going to get us gifts whether we wanted them to or not. So we created 2 small registries with curated items we actually needed and let the rest give money or gift cards once the registry items had run out.
Statistics Canada's new tally of economic output should prompt gut checks all over Ottawa, from the central bank to the Prime Minister's Office to the opposition benches. Everyone appears to have overestimated Canada's ability to generate economic growth without the nitrous boost of zero interest rates. The world beating economy of 2017 wilted in the face of Donald Trump's trade wars, weaker oil prices, and somewhat higher borrowing costs..

While I think the 4% rule is overly optimistic it illustrates that if you live on $40k/year then you need $1m to retire. Again, the duration isn relevant here because 4% of $1m covers the yearly expenses. 
If I were you, I work on retraining the command "Monty" but also stop using his name for anything else. If you want him to come, use your command for come (and remember not to call a dog for anything bad like a bath, better to just lure them to you with a treat than to spoil the "come" command), if you want him to get off of something use them command for "off" or drop/leave something alone, say "drop it"/"leave it" (assuming you already taught these commands). Try not to use his name for anything bad or in a harsh tone.

Trail races are rarely ever the exact distance. You can certify them to USATF standards due to the terrain usually, and trying to gauge distance using GPS watches will be fairly inaccurate due to trees and such.

So there this thing in Japan called "denki anma" or "electric massage" that supposed to be a form of torture between prepubescent boys. I learned about it, the hard way, from Japanese friend. Anyways, this chick who I been on and off flirting with couldn take a joke and hit me in the family jewels, so I chased her down, cornered her, and proceeded to give her the most invigorating denki anma my leg could muster. Her face lit up with blush and a wide smile and her head tilted back; I ended up getting the complete opposite reaction. I kinda just went for broke at that point, calling her dirty and kinky for enjoying it while turning it up to 11. Needless to say it the only time I think I gotten a girl off in little more than a minute. Her pants were still on ffs. Anyone else on r/sex ever have this happen to them?
Chongqing is one of the four municipalities in China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and is the largest and the only one located inland. Since its founding 3,000 years ago, Chongqing has been one of the most notable places in China for fascinating history and brilliant culture. Every year, millions of visitors, from China and overseas come to explore the stunning scenery of the Three Gorges among many other attractions the city has to offer. Today, Chongqing also serves as the economic center of the upstream Yangtze area and major manufacturing base and transportation hub for Southwest China.

Shuttering the charity in the middle of a formal investigation will likely rank as one of Warne strangest decisions in a professional and private life already littered with controversy. Sources close to Warne said he was simply fed up with having to justify himself and had been encouraged by close associates to shut it down because "it all was just too much trouble". Others say he now recognises the fundraising model based on lavish parties, charity auctions and sports days no longer works. 
Yes def if you are that good then definitely stay in the field! As for me I think I am okay at it, but where I am at in Ohio its not the most friendliest and helpful state in IT, I have to work hard even to continue getting the work I do now. I am kind of in between a rock and hard place at times. Ive done IT for a few years and feel a lot more introverted now, I did Korea 7 8 yrs ago and I liked it because teaching gave me energy and it was nice there (came home for family). I am not quite sure if I am that same person though or if Korea is the same country.

Technically, a small business owner would be what we call "petit bourgeois", essentially middle class rather than working class as such. However, that doesnt mean artisans and corner shop owners are the enemy of socialists. A socialist government would nationalise the commanding heights of the economy  the huge billion dollar industries and the banks. Under a nationalised economy these artisans would benefit from decent loans on the basis of banks run for need not profit.

Meanwhile I still dealing with being a cheapskate with my by the hour car rental thing (by the quarter hour technically) to the point where I seem to almost never drive. I have to remind myself that even if I use it once a week for errands its still WAY cheaper than owning a car (using it for like 3 hours once a week would cost me about $100 per month. my insurance alone on a car would cost more than that, my parking would cost more than that, the depreciation of a car would be around that. maintenance for a car might be a half that, then of course gas. and the risks of owning, plus the time to maintain it. i keep missing having a car, then i keep realizing how much time and money i save by just renting when i need one. i wonder if ill ever own a car again lol).

The US intervention was fundamentally wrong and immoral, as per 72 of Americans surveyed in 1975. They had no right to decide what another country wants, which was national unification. It was entirely wrong, no way to skirt around this. American intervention destroyed South Vietnam the country they were supposedly suppose to protect.

Haidee stays with him however. Why? Because she truly loves him from the bottom of his heart. Mercedes did love him, but she loved him as "Edmond Dantes" a man who is no longer, and Haidee loves him as who he is now at the present, "The Count of Monte Cristo". At the end of the book, Edmond Dantes tells her that she should leave, as he is just a broken man who can't do anything for her. Upon saying this, Haidee also tells him that should she leave, she'd die as she cannot imagine a life without him, her beloved. Dantes is incredibly shocked by this, to know that someone still would love him as the broken man he is, and realizes that all this time she had loved him and so had he, but he had distanced himself from her because he thought himself just a man of vengeance with nothing else. He is saved by Haidee like this, because she showed him that he is still capable of a happy future worth living for, despite all his flaws and tragic, broken past.
This seems like a lapse in logic. Crime is relative to law, but being "relative" doesn mean something doesn exist. Crime exists because law exists and crime is an action in violation of the law.
