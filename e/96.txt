Supreme Court hears prostitution challenge
Consider "you make me so mad I could kill you" compared to "I'm upset at you because you didn't put the dishes away when I asked" (obviously an exaggeration). Both have the same meaning (I'm frustrated), but one is kind and helpful, while the other is unkind and damaging.I'd argue that most of your previous downvotes on that comment are because a) you didn't support your claim about chastity, and b) you were unkind: in the abrupt nature of the comment, in the word choice (ie. Irrelevant compared with "not as important as the benefits of obeying God"), and in the general lack of empathetic statements ("I'm sorry you're struggling with this")..

On the other hand, if you have a higher card as compared to the dealer, you will start earning winnings.

Late in Day 2, with the blinds at 6,000/12,000, I folded hands more than a few times on the button. In retrospect, a better strategy would have been to play more aggressively, raising when in position to try to steal the blinds, like when the player in the big blind only had 70,000 in chips and I had 250,000. Instead of making a big raise, say $50,000 from the button, I folded my hand. 
I really surprised that the FO traded away two expirings  one a starter and our main source of shooting, and the other our main defensive stopper  and we not only avoided falling off the map but even appear to be making some strides forward despite the turnover.This is the kind of surprising improvement and cohesion you hope to see with Casey emphasis on instead of playcalling.

If we take at least the quick implementation right now, we can keep the copycats at bay, but the next mass casualty event will always come as a shock.

ARMs are an interesting "financial product." I suppose the idea was invented initially for rich, real estate investor types. See, they could go in, buy a house, and actually pay less than the interest on the loan. Then, as housing prices rose, they could sell the house, play off the mortgage, and walk away with a profit. All of that was great as long as it housing prices were rising and it was investor types taking out the loans. But, of course, all sorts of people took out ARMs and what they didn realize or didn really bank on is after a certain number of years the mortgage payments explode as you have to start paying off the balance and the unpaid interest.

WHY? Because some assholes are bringing back 16th century diseases for fun. Whooping cough is 3 months of HELL! You are the most contagious at the beginning, when it seems like a normal cold. Thank god I wasn around any babies or old people during that time because whooping cough can kill them. I almost blacked out from lack of oxygen several times. They used to call it the 100 day cough because that how long it lasts, and there is nothing you can do to ease the cough. You literally can breathe whenever you cough it is terrifying. 5 points  submitted 3 days ago

The "Blumine" itself deserves mention, since it is so rarely performed as part of the work. Its simpler orchestration, lyrical calm, and soft glissandos make it sound stylistically different from the other movements. Yet Wittry read it with a freshness and charm that absolutely identified it with the rest of the material. It owes much of that charm to some lovely instrumental solos, notably by trumpeter Larry Wright, oboist Megan Marolf, and clarinetist John Schwartz.

Amaya Inc (TSE:AYA) shares were up 16.6% at C$21.38 on Monday after its founder David Baazov offered to take the company private in a deal worth around C$6.7bn, just weeks after merger talks with UK bookmaker William Hill (LON:WMH) fell apart.According to a filing to the Toronto stock exchange, Baazov and his financial backers are offering C$24 for each outstanding common share for the Quebec based company in an equity and debt deal. If accepted, the offer price would represent a 31% premium on Amaya's closing share price on Friday.The offer, including debt and transaction costs, is valued at C$6.7bn, Amaya said in a regulatory filing.The equity portion of the deal would be C$4.1bn and will be mostly financed by four funds, which have committed C$3.65bn and Baazov's own shares valued at C$427mln.

Hahahah that fine. Beef fat (tallow) is a super traditional beauty ingredient though. I just used lard, pig fat, instead.

It really is much more hydrating than anything else I used, without leaving my skin oily. And the cream looks like any other cream you used
How can a President as smart as Obama surround himself with a bunch of war profiteers and peddlers of death? Letting Bush man, Gates, be his most trusted adviser on the war is as if Dumbledore listened to Voldemort right hand man. Obama should fire Gates (and Clinton for that matter) and surround himself with people who are not invested in endless war but rather seeking real alternatives to it. And if he doesn we can only assume the Death Eaters have already sucked out his soul..

Texas poker is clearly very position dependent. The dealer has a decided advantage because they get to see the other players bets before deciding how they want to play the hand. The dealer position shifts to the left with each hand to balance this. Since the game is often played using a professional dealer, a disc called 'the button is used to signify the dealer position and it is this button that circles around the table instead. If you haven't already, give Texas poker a shot. I bet you'll love it.

The player and dealer are each dealt 3 cards which are placed face down. The object of the game is for you to get a higher three card poker hand than the dealer. An important rule that people must remember when playing three card poker is regarding the hand ranks. In three card poker a straight is higher than a flush because there are fewer ways to make a 3 card straight than a 3 card flush.
They are advocating to not give advice, hence the mods saying "this is not an advice sub".

In arriving at his decision, Justice Conlan noted that proliferation of self represented litigants in family law cases is here to stay. I suspect that there are many reasons for that: cuts to legal aid services, the self help resorted to on the world wide web, and (let us not be so naive to ignore) the voluntary choice by some litigants to act for themselves because they think that the judge will be forced into being their advocate. What may be a warning to individuals who choose to represent themselves for strategic reasons, the judge noted is time that we recognize that there are some (not most, maybe even not many) persons who can readily afford legal counsel but simply choose to act for themselves because they think that it will provide them a tactical edge in the courtroom.

I agree with commenter below though about paying for the mortgage. I don see why there is anything wrong with paying money towards housing. you pay all the bills but aren on the deed of the house. This would probably make it legally harder to reclaim your contribution in the case you split.

Also, yeah I'm not trying to blatantly cut lines or anything like that and I never give the floor a hard time with wait lists, they have no control over seats opening up. I had just heard online that some people tip the floor and are able to get preferential treatment. I understand the moral qualms about that, so I was trying to gauge how common this happens; if everyones doing it, I would. It seems like its not actually as common as I thought, so meh I guess I'll wait. It's just annoying how you cant call in and you have to stay nearby, otherwise you might miss getting called. Yesterday, I was waiting for 30 mins and got called, so I headed to the back podium since thats where the floor who was announcing names on the mic was, ended up waiting like 2 3 mins as he was helping someone else and then he told me 1/3 and 2/5 seating I need to go to the front (which makes sense, but since it was a new room, I guess I wasn't thinking) and by the time I got to the front they had given my seat and I ended up waiting 20 more mins. very frustrating but not their fault at all.
When you are in position, you want to make your opponents decision as hard as possible. By raising your marginal hands on the flop, you making it easy for the out of position player to play.

Even with all that said anime has approached WWII both directly and indirectly many times. Zipang and Barefoot Gen woud be direct ones. In Zipang a modern warship gets sent back in time and they have to decide if they really want to help Japan win the war knowing the bad stuff the Empire did. Barefoot Gen meanwhile is about the nuclear bombing but a lot of it, and a even more of the manga, is focussed on how fucked up Japanese society was during the war. Oh and there is that one segment of The Cockpit which is about kamikaze pilots and hows how fucked up that whole situation was. Finally you have real roobot shows of which I say about a good 60% of them (well pre 2004 shows anyway) in some way are about the war. A lot of the early and mid generation of directors were extremely anti war due to their personal experiences and would often put critiques of the Japanese Empire into their shows in more subtle ways, because of course these were still kids shows after all.

We spent most of the time with my mother's family so I recall happy times when we all slept on the floor of the cabin at harvest time. Chestnuts, walnuts, filberts and us kids filling baskets of acorns that fell to the ground used for feeding the pigs. 
The first thing that you should do in order to learn about the used casino poker chips that you have is to carefully observe the colors and the artwork that is contained on the chip. In most instances, a casino will implement the use of very specific artwork and a unique selection of colors in order to indicate that the particular chip belongs to their casino. You should observe these types of identifiers and they will be able to help you identify where the chips originated.
For example last week I was shopping at the supermarket and an old man was trying to convince the workers to allow him take the supermarket cart for 10 minutes and bring it back afterwards because his bags were too heavy.

Remember, your main goal should be to rest, relax and have some fun, and there are certainly tons of ways to do this on a budget. It's good to plan around the different attractions available in your town; the key here is to be creative and to keep an open mind. Places to try out would include your local museum, an amusement park, your local planetarium, and the list goes on. Include lunch at a picnic grove in your itinerary. Remember, this is your chance to rediscover the wonders and delights that your own town has to offer.

Of course, casino games are only fun when there's money to be made. Unlike the traditional games of skill like poker, slots offer the prospect of big wins by pure chance. This is psychologically very appealing, as demonstrated by our unerring desire to buy lottery tickets. Progressive jackpot games offer an engaging alternative to buying a lottery ticket, combining the possibility of winning a life changing amount of money with the fun and engagement of playing a game.

The guys who were used to the high scoring upstairs alley of the Old Market were finding things a bit more difficult on the Commercial alley and lost a further 10 pins on the fifth hand thanks to some steady Wanderers skittling and a 16 flopper from a back on form OJ Stabbins. The Wanderers then took the foot off the gas as the last two hands of 58 and 57 respectively, let the "home" team pull 9 pins back to avoid the whitewash, but then cruised to victory by 39 pins.

This is a very fast way and very good excuse for stripping naked, not to mention this will give you great motivation in playing poker.

Typical drunkards (making a commotion or yelling down the street) on mostly the weekend nights. I live by the Pacific Union train tracks, which shakes my building a tiny bit, but doesn bother me. I in an older complex that doesn have dual pane windows, so that probably doesn help with noise suppression.Since we are in the City of Trees (not the Farm to Fork capital, though that is happening tomorrow), the sounds tend to travel and echo more as the noises bounce off the trees and 2+ story tall buildings.I live on a second floor/level which helps provide me with a sense of privacy from ground level pedestrians/transients/thieves, slightly better "view" of the street, more natural sunlight.

This is a rare chance for that franchise and I absolutely commend them for going all in.. 
I would call the Punisher an edge case that falls between LN and LE, with a focus on his own personal code BECAUSE the law of the land is insufficient. I think that an important distinction when we talk about Lawful characters being so because they have a personal code  IMO that only really applies if that personal code either is aligned with the law of their culture (born or adopted,) or if the character is involved in some sort of conflict regarding what the "right" law is.
Finally, I also agree that the robotic nature of his portrayal made him much less scary to me.

The first few episodes are pretty much what you expect from a children tv show. You have to power through that to find the worthwhile stuff, the little bits of quirky humor and pop culture references that an adult is more likely to catch than a child. Keep in mind that the show was designed to have children parents sit down with them and watch it too. It aimed almost entirely at children, but the creators also didn want parents to have to stab their eyes out either. I think this is the primary source of MLP older audience; little tidbits and jokes that make them chuckle and think "oh gee I guess this show isn so shallow and immature after all!".

In the bathtub, but not on a phone. You can set your tv up in the sink. I highly recommend leaving the hot water running in a very tiny stream, and wedging a toothbrush handle under the stopper so the tub drains slowly. That way, your water never gets cold so long as you move around from time to time. If you sit still, the water at your feet will get too hot and slowly cook you, but it better than shocking yourself when you inevitably fall asleep and drop your phone. 1 point  submitted 3 days ago

3. Where the regulation since the collapse of the banking system? Why didn Bernanke limit the amount of interest banks could charge ordinary Americans at say 15% (which is what credit unions charge) instead of still letting them charge 30%? Why weren executive compensation packages regulated? Why were the interests of large financial institutions put before the interests of ordinary Americans?.

Moving stuff: Baselayer and fleece, in whatever combination, selected so that I rarely have to remove and carry the fleece. For those types of temperatures, a heavyweight baselayer and a zip up hoody fleece (MH Microchill is what I have) would be my go to, although I might go light base+Melanzana+Microchill, if I were confident that it wouldn warm up so much that I have to carry the Melly. Basically, during the hottest part of the day, my ideal is to have an unzipped hooded fleece over a base layer (and possibly over the Melly, too, if it cold).

Well, a Catholic thinks every life is worth being lived. So if you're born with a disability it doesn't mean that you are worse off than other people.

It could simply complete the balance of the year and if there is a deficit, the owners repay the deficit amount in the following fiscal year as either part of the next operating budget by majority vote or a special levy or contingency expense by three quarters vote.The council could also convene a special general meeting before the fiscal year end to approve a special levy to make up the projected differences, or seek the approval of the owners by three quarters vote to suspend operations of the pool facilities to the end of the fiscal year.While I appreciate the fiscal prudence of your council, it also has to be recognized the pool facilities are a key part of your resort property through the winter, and closing the facility may have negative impact on your owners' ability to rent their units.If your strata council does not respond, you may, by 20 per cent petition of the owners, demand a special general meeting to direct the council by majority vote to open the facilities. The meeting must be held within four weeks after the demand is given to the strata corporation. If the council does not hold the meeting within the time period, the petitioners may give notice of the meeting and petitioned agenda items.There is a significant amount of debate over what constitutes a significant change to common property.

So, in this context, companies like Uber can be very agressive in responding to chargebacks they see as fraud. An open account where the payments for services rendered are removed this way can cause the consumer to lose access to that service as the business refuses to work with them until payment is made, debt being sent to a collection agency, or a lawsuit. Usually it doesn go past step one, depending on the business, but loss of ability to utilize a company like Uber could be undesirable.

I see if I can find an example of two guys signing exclusive tags at the same position.Edit 2: It does not look like there ever been a case where two players at the same position have wound up playing on exclusive tags in the same year.The language for the exclusive tag says that the salary is set based on the top 5 salaries a few weeks into free agency (early april), but the tag has to be tendered before free agency starts (mid march). I can imagine that the NFL would allow for a situation where a player would get paid less the earlier they chose to sign their contract, so there must be language that says tag salaries aren included in the calculation.. 
Button open is fine with these stack sizes and a fish in blinds. Flop play is ok with a nice disguised gutshot and great implied odds here, if the fish is raising for value here, he is never going to fold when you hit.

Sure! Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (commonly called the "Mormon" Church) can technically drink whatever they want! Most members choose to follow the "Word of Wisdom", a health code they believe was revealed by God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Subsequent Church leaders have added 'addictive or habit forming substances' and in recent years have specifically mentioned energy drinks. How a Church member decides to interpret these guidelines is between he and the Lord. It is generally interpreted as alcohol, coffee, and tea. Some Church members may also choose to avoid hot chocolate, energy drinks, caffeinated sodas, or even all soda. It just depends on what they think is right. I know active members of the Church that are in good standing in the Church who drink caffeinated sodas on a daily basis. I also know Church members in good standing who do not drink any soda. I know active members who often drink energy drinks as well. In order to maintain a temple recommend, as most Church members do, they must avoid alcohol, coffee, and tea. Anything beyond that is their personal interpretation and decision. If you'd like to read the "Word of Wisom" for yourself, visit the "Related Links" below. (Full Answer)

10 points  submitted 11 days agoWe dated for a while, and still hooked up occasionally after "breaking up." Although she was conventionally only just above average in looks the way she carried herself, talked, acted and just existed made me fall head over heels for her.After being together as a couple/"friends" for eight months she went overseas to finish her degree (she was taking a gap year after some messed up stuff happened to her) and although we talked less we were still affectionate (in a non sexual way) with each other.I met up with her over the summer and she made it quite clear from the start that she wanted to be friends, not "friends" with all the sexual intimacy that came with being "friends." She wanted to hook me up with a friend of hers and I ended up dating her friend for the past 8 or so months.I want to see her as just a friend but to be honest I still have quite a lot of feelings for her.So what am I doing? I not talking to her, at least not for now. In the future when my feelings have died down I hope that we can hang out sometime and just be friends but at the moment I feel that if I talk to her it won be helpful to myself or more importantly her or my girlfriend.With yourself OP maybe you could try dating other women? Maybe when you are seeing someone else your feelings for her will start to lessen.
