I wonder if they just do it so the burglar gets away so they dont have to worry about catching him.

Wood Processing: IMO a saw and a good quality/sized knife (7.75in blade) is a far more versatile combo, than even an axe. Unless you plan to be downing trees and processing wood that is over 12in thick, a good SvenSaw and Knife will do you just fine for most fire sized chunks. Also, if you don already know how, you should practice the fine art of wood, as a method to split and process..

You don't have to prove THEM wrong; you'll just have to challenge them to prove YOU wrong.

"Clifton team," he said, "Mendel." He switched off his communications as well, and they looked about themselves. 
Expect them to try some ill advised moves on you. If the line looks very suspect, it probably because it is. This is especially true with a fairly dry board that didn interest them at all on early streets but is suddenly God gift to them. The amateur pro knows they should bluff sometimes, but they don know how to use their actions from previous betting rounds to inform whether they could make a believable bluff on the river. Just earlier today, I called down one of these guys with king high. Naturally, he missed the back door straight draw that kept him in the pot when the flop was bet, gave up on the turn, and then fired off a pot sized bet on the river. He had eight high. This is not atypical. Making some of these calls will make you money.

The rook can still take, but then the new queen takes the rook, the other black rook takes and then the king takes the rook. The end result is that Hikaru just exchanged his two rooks for two pawns and it is an EASY win for white, but white didn think of advancing the pawn as helping out, white just saw that the next move would be for the rook to take the pawn and it would be checkmate..

It's also hard to question a general prognostication of doom a day after 56 exotic animals were released into the countryside by the owner of a "private zoo" in Ohio, just before he shot himself to death.

Ah, I LOVE Obama. wait, in the same week that Obama did this, he also asked for $33 Billion more for the wars, on top of the record $703 Billion dollar request for next year for the Defense Department. Um, let see, $736 Billion dollars for two illegal and immoral wars in one year alone versus collecting $90 Billion back over 12 years when Wall Street will still owe $117 Billion to the American people (and let just point out that these loans will not only NOT be paid back in full, but were given interest free. that to the millions of Americans losing their homes because the greedy bankers wouldn even lower interest payments that can only be described as usurous).
The basic gist is that it follows a dude trying to hold down a job in post bubble Japan. He kind of a deadshit, and after he cosigns a loan for a friend, finds himself on the hook for a fuckload of debt. The only way out for him is to gamble and gamble big, and it turns out gambling and strategy are the only things Kaiji actually has talent for, and my God is he talented. This is a show about the art of gambling and the exploitation of seemingly random and unfair systems to one own advantage, with a mindgame foundation that makes your Lelouches and Ls look like the hack written wannabes they are.

It similar to radio, the license is not for any individual song. There is actually a niche industry where people will go around and help you claim royalties you may never have known existed.

I understand how changes needed to be made, this is a terrible situation, but it seems a little ridiculous how only male nurses need a specifically female worker present to do their job on 50% of their patients. Are male observers not also capable of stopping this from happening again? Regardless that she was pregnant, she was RAPED, and the same thing can be done to men in a similar state, why not also require all workers to be observed if you're going to say male ones specifically need to be observed.. 
Even with say, the Saturn V, it isn that our technology has regressed or even moved sideways, it that we do it very differently, in a manner that isn compatible with the mostly computerless world of the Saturn V.

Now, this is PURELY personal preference, but I think having Matt and the "battle camera" above/below one another would be a better layout, since it conveys the "this side is the game, that side is the players". I understand if this was an intentional decision to have the layout seems less like CR, and maybe it just the layout I used to, but it just a thought.B/X D AD 1e and 2e are all in a tier together: classes get variable hit dice, so Warriors get better while spell casters get worse, but then also you get variable weapon damage dice. You also start getting Constitution modifiers for HP.AD 2e is probably the most lethal within this grouping, because the default stat generation roll is 3d6 in order.AD 1e is slightly better in this regard, because the default stat generation roll is 4d6 drop lowest.B/X D actually uses 3d6 in order, but the Constitution modifiers apply to all classes, and the DM is advised to give additional/set HP at low levels, so it probably still the least lethal in that regard..

Respect your opponents; meaning wait for your turn. You may have the winning hand with all aces in tow but try to stop yourself from laying the cards and jumping on tables or even gloating. Wait your turn! The same is true when you fold. Wait your turn because folding randomly when you see you a bad hand will just confuse the order of the game.

I think if you do it with people you know, it does not feel like criticism but rather like idea generation, the whole talking about it throwing ideas around is great for my creativity and confirms my feelings of something being off on a certain section.

In effect, you can "bully" the table by making big raises and re raises, and forcing other players to risk all or almost all of their chips (whereas you have a cushion because you've already accumulated extra chips). The downside, of course, is that it's easier to bust out early with this strategy. The second school of thought is more conservative and stresses simply surviving early in the tournament, and looking for advantageous opportunities later when the blinds are higher and the stakes greater.

The fight for transgender rights is a growing movement on many college campuses and other places where young people gather. In the same way that the Civil Rights campaign helped to break down the color line, the transgender movement is breaking down the gender divide. Some transgendered persons live as one sex or the other (not the one they were assigned at birth), but many also live as "trans" or "gender queer" or in other ways refuse to be a man or a woman or insist on being both. What to do with a movement that undermines the basis of gay and straight desire? That is, if straight people are attracted to the opposite sex and gay people the same sex, what happens when you attracted to someone who is both or neither? Perhaps it is this discomfort that led the Human Rights Campaign Fund to cut trans people out of its campaign for a national Employment Non Discrimination Act (ENDA). The mainstream gay and lesbian movement was interested in protecting employees from discrimination on the basis of sexual identity, not diversity of gender expression.

This was the result of callous deregulation. The interesting thing is that no one of these regulatory efforts brought down the house.

The hubris of Empire is that we truly and really believe that the way we do things is the most evolved way and thus all the world wishes to be like us. Missed the part that while we were living out a John Wayne fantasy of liberating the Russkis from the Commies, the Russian government and people were writing something far more like Dostoevsky "The Brothers Karamazov." the scene where the Grand Inquisitor is speaking with Jesus Christ who has returned to save the people? they talk the Inquisitor   who is Russia   explains to Jesus   who is the US   that it is truly the Inquisitor who cares about the people since what the people really want is an easy set of rules to follow in this life, not some impossible set of standards to ascend into Heaven in the hereafter. Some point, Jesus/the US understands that his righteousness is not really what the masses need and he kisses the Grand Inquisitor to show that he understands the error of his ways..

Last thing, it fine to fold this hand pre flop, depending on your opponents. The worse they are, the better the call is, however against decent players its probably a fold. If it was only a 3x raise, or if the stacks were 200BB+, or if you had a read that your opponent was fit or fold and you knew you could push him off the better hand some portion of the time then it a perfectly fine call, but if none of those things are true then this is just a bit too high a percentage of your stack to be cold calling suited connectors with, even on the button.

Another one on the first floor 'discharged' into coffin like boxes on the ground floor, that had to be emptied daily by the servants, washed in the moat waters, and placed ready for the next 'customers'!

If a girl likes both offerings, she fires back a selfie mimicking his, opening up a chat. Meeting up with total strangers is not a risk free exercise, and more so if the prospect of having no strings sex is on the cards.

I asked James Higham, an anthropology professor at New York University who specializes in communication, why we revert to amorphous moaning in these situations versus using the gift of articulate language, which we developed almost miraculously over many millennia of painstaking evolution.

That said, my one complaint is that some people did not get the hint of the small registry.

3. Produce not just incremental gains but exponential gains by recognizing how your business really makes money.

The dancers were definitely the worst part of it. Some dancers are normal people, but a lot of them are ego driven loons that think the event is about them, completely forgetting the whole kid and cancer thing.

Whenever there's money involved, there are people willing to cheat. When poker was first played on Mississippi riverboats, it was often referred to simply as, "the cheating game." So it should come as no surprise that cheaters have gone to great lengths over the decades to give themselves an upper hand. Many cheating methods require a confederate, a partner at the table to help you put the plan into action. Usually, the dealer must be involved; considering the surveillance in place at modern casinos, finding a crooked dealer there is increasingly rare. However, at a less formal poker game, where the actual dealer rotates around the table, the two cheaters simply have to wait until one of them has the deal to put the plan into action.

The discussion is good because it brought up some issues we need to address but going around and trying to get the identity of every user who disagrees with you and trying to rally people to leave the sub seems awfully childish/trollish. It makes me question your intentions of making the thread in the first place. Most people who are on the sub have been here a while although we do get new users all the time.
Spend spare time thinking through different hand scenarios and try to find the optimal play to exploit your opponents. For example, you on the button against the big blind in a single raised pot and you see a flop of AK6. He check/calls and another 6 hits the turn. What the best play? It doesn even matter what your hand is. I argue most of the time we should overbet the pot, because his preflop flop plays mean he rarely has AA/KK/AK, but you could still have those hands. And he just can profitably continue with Ax or KQ, which is a huge portion of his range. What can he do to combat your play? Start calling us light? That fine, because we have him beat due to our range advantage very often. Now, if you go through that thought process for many different scenarios, you just have a better understanding of the game.

While the word is still in use for certain administrative purposes, it has no clear definition. It conveys that a person is old, but not how old, or old in what capacity.

If the shoe was on the other foot and Fernanda didn't want to talk to Jonathan, then he was making comments like "You can ignore my messages but you won't ignore me when I put it on public blast!" I feel like people would be more outraged. People would be crying it's harassment or emotional manipulation and that's 100% what I think Fernanda is doing. If someone ignores your messages, it's because they aren't interested in talking and trying to force contact isn't kosher.

Shino may be as blind as ever, but I think Eugene is finally understanding a little that the situation they are in is as much their issue as it is Orga reason that I like this scene with Eugene is because it contrasts well with the earlier scene of Engineer pulling up Dane and Pompadour discussion about how Tekkadan needs more guys like them. Tekkadan issue was never lacking people who could think, it was their lack of desire to speak up. Similarly any of the three new guys could have had a dramatic effect on Tekkadan but all three either lacked the desire (Dane) or influence (Pompadour) to step up or let themselves get caught up in the momentum of events (Hush).I loved that Piano only version of Crescent Moon.

My state decided that unless a person is a danger to the public, they shouldn receive state funded psychiatric care even if they can care for themselves. I see a lot of homeless people.

In my opinion the US (and plenty of other countries, but i live in the us) is only succeeding in providing some negative liberties (freedom from having your guns taken away, or freedom from government action over your speech, OG john locke type stuff) than creating any positive liberty (Security of any kind that would allow people to do what they want).

His latest book is The Missing Files..

Thank goodness hubs sees through her completely so her plan won't work. Hubs is just worried about what to say when and if my JNMom asks him what he thought of the book! He is thinking he's going to say he didn't find it relevant so he didn't read it and was curious what made her think of him for this book. 
But, the first myth is really the whopper: I mean, how do you even hate someone for their freedoms, anyhow? The closest analogy I can think of is black Americans resenting white Americans over their social privilege, which translates to tangible freedoms in many cases. Or women resenting men for their freedom to walk safely at night in bad neighborhoods, or travel solo in third world countries, or whatever.

Think you should just be thinking about what the opponents are thinking. If the whole table knows you are a preflop nit then every time they raise you it will be as a bluff, because they know that you are only calling with aces/kings.

Before Black Friday, anyone who wanted to put money online to play a quick game of online poker could just toss on a couple hundred dollars, lose it, and no big deal.

The whole thing was just surreal. I was sitting right next to the podium and listening to the floor continue to answer phone calls, "Aria poker room how can I help you? Okay I got you on the list, thank you" while the doctors are over there yelling "WHERE IS THE AED" just seemed so eerie to me.

The AXA thing is a neat example, and it not wrong, but keep in mind there no functional difference between what you said and AXA paying the flight tracker to handle refunds for them with normal bank accounts   the smart contract is relying on the tracker to tell the truth.

These types of projects were common throughout the soviet era, as for planned economies an extensive growth in the inputs of production is much easier to accomplish then the intensive growth with existing inputs as we see in modern economies.The early surge in farm production encouraged him to talk in 1957 of overtaking American per capita meat production by 1975, something to which the Soviet Union never came close. Reliance on the unstable grain harvest from the Virgin Lands produced acute difficulties when the harvest failed both there and in traditional grain growing regions in 1963.Talk of overtaking the US both in terms of meat production and in terms of the general economy now looks silly.

For a hair and make up team that hadn't styled a show professionally to date, the IFAP's team debut was worth acknowledging. The red lips from L'Oreal's versatile 'I am Red' palette and simple kohl lined eyes were well executed. The hair could have benefitted from some fun summer styles such as messy braids instead of the poker straight look that all the models wore but according to Mehreen, the idea was to keep it deliberately simple. "We did about 200 different looks, not just for the two segments of the fashion show but also for some of the guests who were part of the event. It was a proud moment for me that the team pulled it off and managed to stay calm despite the immense pressure. With this out of the way, I know we are ready for bigger things."
I get that Blizzard balances mana usages by ability costs, but this does very little to alter a hero early/mid/late game. I mean, take Leoric on TotSQ, what are you, as an opponent, supposed to do against a player mounting between lanes for Reanimation stacks?.

I had lasik about 14 years ago. Best money I ever spent. I was nearly blind without glasses (and couldn't wear contacts) and even with my night vision being a little worse and some dry eye issues that were resolved with tear duct plugs (I had dry eyes before surgery, it made them worse) it was still more than worth it. If your vision isn't that bad or you get by with contacts fine then maybe it's not worth it to you, but for me it was. The surgery wasn't bad either, they give you Valium beforehand which helps a lot with the "someone is messing with my eyeballs" anxiety. She took deliberate actions that could have cost you a huge amount of money and stress to get your child back, for no reason other than that she's absolutely batshit crazy and being enabled by HIS OWN FATHER.

We were supposed to get the car at noon, but again, since this was kind of an underground deal, we didn't complain when the car showed up at 8 pm. We hit the road that very minute. We drove all night, passing through Ankara (where we got lost and had the nicest taxi drivers help us find the right road by climbing in our backseat to physically direct us to the road) to Cappadocia, which is the area of Turkey with the craziest landscape you have ever seen! Star Wars was filmed there, and that's how it really looks. We stayed in a hostel in the town Goreme, and our room was in a cave. We had a great time there, met tons of crazy people, and hung out each night at a cave bar called "Flintstones Bar". During the day we visited the surrounding sights, like the fairy chimney rock formations.
Face the music To confront stoically the consequences of one deeds; to face up to an unpleasant or trying experience. This expression may have originated in the theater, where actors and actresses nervously awaited their cues to come onstage and thus the music in the pit. Another origin may lie in the military practice of mustering soldiers in full battle regalia for inspection, often at the call of a bugle. Figuratively, this term refers to a personal confrontation for which one must gather courage.

You have to pump the water to develop pressure, and the reverse osmosis membranes are always getting fouled and damaged.

That is why desalination is somewhat rare (though more common than a lot of people think) and is only used in large amounts in very dry places.

Understand card counting. You're not literally counting the value of all the cards. What some players do (when they're really good) is count the "value" of the deck, or, more specifically, how many aces and tens are left to be played (or this and that.) If lots are still to be seen, they up their bets, knowing the likelihood of them getting a good hand is better..
