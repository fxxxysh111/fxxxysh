Personally I would do it ASAP because of the issues. Otherwise I just wait until the blooms have fallen off naturally before repotting.

With moss it usually took me to water about once every two weeks but with bark I water once a week. Unless it been super humid or cold. When I do buy a new orchid I wait until the blooms fall off then just repot right after so I can see what going on in there. Anyways, that was long! I hope that all helps and orchids are very tough plants, they usually bounce back but it takes a long time.

We still got a good grade though and we told the lecturer knew he didn't turn up so he got 0% for it. But he did cost the group part of our grade.

The phone rings. It's Laura calling to tell me he has made more threats. "He says he is going to 'check up' on the place. We are trying to convince him this is a bad idea." She goes on about him and how if he keeps this up we will have to go to a safe house again. I hate those safe houses. Then she says,' We are trying to find him a permanent therapist who can make the decision about hospitalizing him or putting him on meds.' My thoughts are,' why haven't you done this yet?' But I hold my tongue. I should be grateful for just this phone call because she isn't allowed to tell me anything. So far all I know is he has a mental illness and that he wants us dead.

"Aural memory" alone makes any subjective comparison more or less invalid, and the longer it went between the listens the less valid it is. Obviously one can decide if it sounds good or not when you listening, but trying to comparatively quantify that to something you heard days or weeks earlier is total bullshit. Humans are irrational creatures at best with extremely foggy abilities to remember anything objectively   our preferences and opinions and preconceived notions are vastly more likely to just have done a real number on whatever memory we have.

In Jam v. IFC, Indian fishing communities and farmers, represented by EarthRights International, sued the IFC in an effort to hold the institution accountable for harms resulting from the Tata Mundra Ultra Mega coal fired power plant in Gujarat, India, which received an IFC loan in 2008. Affected communities originally sought redress through the IFC's independent accountability mechanism, the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO), alleging that the IFC caused the loss of their livelihoods and property and threats to their health. While the CAO found a number of counts of non compliance, the IFC largely dismissed their findings.
For the next part I made a screenshot to better explain what strategy I use. As soon as the Sire teleports me, I click at the spot under the number 1. Once I reached that spot, the Sire will have spawned a pool on the left that you avoid by running away. When you run back to the Sire, you won be hit by this pool either because it its 2 tiles on your left. Now when you run back to the sire to attack it again (number 2), it will spawn another pool that you avoid by simply running towards it. By following line 2 the tentacle next to Sire won be able to hit you.
My kitty has decided she is no longer afraid of the world and has stated to kill things. I keep her inside but my housemate has been letting her out when I not home. She been killing those gray birds with the yellow beek that have been swooping her since she was first outside. 
Yes and no. The less experienced a female bodied person is sexually, the more likely it is that they will be more on the nervous/tense side when first becoming sexually active. This means the muscles in the vagina contract and tighten up (which is the main cause of painful sex for those that experience it when first becoming sexually active with internal stimulation). But over time, they will start relaxing more and more as they become more comfortable and less nervous about the activity and that allows the muscles to naturally relax. This can make the vagina feel less tight for their sexual partner.
On summer days, when the interior of the statue is 20 degrees hotter than outside, a new HVAC system will keep Lady Liberty cooler. In winter, she'll be warmer.
The only reason I find this worth discussing is because it will undoubtedly become a talking point in the coming years as live streaming becomes even more mainstream and professionalism/sponsorships will be more dependent on behaviour. 
Depending on the character, you won even get a hit off without proper guarding technique due to attack priority (see Crow). Especially since two or three Bread n Butter combos will cost you the round.

It because women body shapes vary more, our clothing varies more, and our clothes are generally worn tighter, so it more complex fitting things properly. Like, I have an average inseam for a woman and a 24 inch waist, but if I grab a pair of 24 jeans to try on, there like a 95% chance they won fit properly. Women have such differences in curviness and weight distribution that there are extra dimensions you have to take into consideration with sizing, so labeling based on one or two measurements would tell you practically nothing about how it would fit.

You give them chips and a seat at the table. You play like they're there, dealing them cards each hand, and posting their antes and blinds in for them. Whenever the play comes around to them, you fold their hand. If you hear they are not showing up, then what's left of the chips are removed from the game. In this case the "5 of a kind" is the highest possible hand but will rarely be found in live poker games. Wild card poker can be found more in Video Poker games. (Full Answer)

Max may get an annual bonus of $13,500 which would be $700 to $800 per month after tax. That provides wiggle room in addition to current unallocated savings of as much as $1,053 per month. That income flow can go to the kids for university expenses other than room and board, for they live at home. In three years, when the kids have finished university, this money can go to retirement savings, Einarson advises. Those savings can be added to their present cash balance, $69,594. For now, if they reserve $34,000 for the remaining university expense, they will have $35,594 for mortgage paydown. The outstanding balance, $262,606 less this residual cash would leave a balance of about $227,000. To pay off that balance in the dozen years to Loretta age 65, assuming three per cent interest, would require monthly payments of $1,880. That $435 more than their present mortgage cost of $1,445 per month, but it would ensure that they go into retirement with no major debt. They could still add $480 to their RRSPs and $500 to TFSAs each month, as they do now, and boost these contributions with leftover cash.

Maybe I am optimistic and an idiot (Trump and Brexit did happen   are still happening) but I also see a trend upwards in fighting the good fight.

If you own the phone and have forgotten the lock, you'll have to take it to your phone retailer with proof that you own the phone (for example a printed copy of your phone bill). If you do not own the phone legally, you have to hand it in to the nearest iPhone/Apple retailer or the local police. And believe it or not, "finders keepers" is actually a myth. The law states you must put in considerable effort to make sure the lost item find its way back into the hands of the owner. It's also possible that the phone has a tracking device on it, as many smartphones do nowadays, either through paid contract services or through a downloaded app. If it's yours and you forgot the code, take it to the retailer with proof you own it. If it's not yours, take it to the retailer or the police (or risk being traced and arrested for handling stolen/missing goods). Take it to the retailer, a local iphone shop, with proof of ownership.

Craps is known as the world's most common dice game and it is played, with varying rules and sizes of table, in virtually every casino on the planet.

When you sit down, spend a few seconds imagining that there is a thread of light pulling you gently up by the crown of your head and let the rest of your spine find its own place.

It's just a silly thing to hear people accepting Herb's stoppage off of assumptions that the choke was a done deal if given more time.

Despite all this home grown technology talent, there are many cases where Canadian born ICT companies are overlooked by large enterprises and government entities. A research report from the University of Ottawa Telfer School of Management found that a minority of small to midsize companies are doing any kind of business with the federal government. And since little more than 100 of those 39,000 ICT companies are large enterprises, it means many firms are on the outside looking in at the massive $20 billion government spend, of which $6 billion is on IT.

Why would you be ok with this? Even if he was elected legitimately, he still be a monstrously unethical felon who put in jeopardy America interests by potentially giving leverage to a foreign, mostly hostile superpower to install a president friendly to them. If the action committed was not severe enough to actually influence the election results, then there is a good chance (although not certain) that whatever was done was minor or commonplace..

Tumblr does have high quality clips, but they are short. Instead of Korea, I noticed China has been on the rise because censorship is worse in their country. You do have couples or photographers who do exclusive shoots or try to promote gangbangs. The lower quality stuff is on more mainstream Korean only streaming sites. Pornhub, Xhamster, and Xvideos have a limited selection. Rarely will you see couples posting their homemade stuff with a traceable moniker. No problem about soranet :) Just to add, they would do hardcore stuff like analyze moles or tattoos to identify models on Twitter or Instagram. Photoshop posed an obvious barrier, but it did cause the mods concern as they would ban certain keywords to find them.

The reason this is such an advantage is that the button gets to see what everyone else does before he/she has to act.

Get into the habit of not wearing too much perfume in the first place and knowing where to apply it. Instead of putting it directly onto your skin, spray one blast upwards in the air in front of you and walk through the mist it creates. Choose a couple of places, such as your chest and neck and when applying, hold the bottle a good 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) away from your body when you spray. If you're wearing a heavier scent, try applying it just to the lower part of your body, like a quick spritz behind the knees. The scent won't rise as quickly and be as irritating to others. You'll find the proper balance soon enough, and your scent will draw people closer rather than repel them.

The seeds must first be sown, and then the roots must take hold, and then the flower must bud and then finally blossom. According to Gaudiyas, it was Sriman Mahaprabhu, in virtue of being (as we believe) Krsna Himself, who preached the topmost knowledge (the blossoming of the flower of Krsna Prema). All the acharya that preceded Him were only preparing the way for Him. Madhvacharya preached a heavily dualistic theory to counter the philosophy of Sankara and establish the sumpremcy of Narayana.

Very cute indeed. Are there any scientific studies out there to prove frogs do infact form emotional bonds with eachother? When two snakes "cuddle" like that it's not actually because they are friends but because they tolerate eachother and both want to use the same space because it's safe there or a good basking area. I would imagine it is the same for amphibians. I think we only assume they have a bond is because we think like a human.

Taking one of those sidewalk scooters around the beach walk would be fun for anyone. Staying on the west side will also give you access to the free Getty Museum, Getty Villa, and Malibu beaches within driving distance as well.

The initial starting hand is composed of four hole cards dealt face down. Aside from this, 5 board cards are dealt face up in the center of the table and are considered as community cards.

Oh I'm sure their ancestors wanted to clear their name because of how cannibalism was looked at by society. But they also didn't find any human bone at the site is what really makes people question the cannibalism claims.

It presented the odds of winning for virtually every game of chance. Naturally, the player never had an even playing field. The odds ALWAYS favored the house, often into double digit advantages. He shared his knowledge at least in part to help those committed to gambling to try and do it rationally.
