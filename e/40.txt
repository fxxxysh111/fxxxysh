You don't have to prove THEM wrong; you'll just have to challenge them to prove YOU wrong.

After the bubble has burst and you have made the cash, you should ramp up your aggression even further.

The correct strategy to become a successful tournament player is somewhere in between these two styles. As always, you should bet when you are a favorite to win, but in close situations in a tournament it may be best to hold back unless you are getting short stacked (to have the smallest amount of chips in a tournament). If your stack gets too low, you will be forced to choose a good starting hand and probably bet all of your chips, hoping no one else has a better hand.

So, they think that you are logically trying to get as many chips into the pot, out of their stacks as you can. 
Even professionals must play a style that is natural for them, but overall they are far more flexible in reacting to the environment than amateurs. All of which means there are no fixed rules for what percentage of hands "should" be won. At lower stakes, I would say that as a general rule the professionals are winning fewer but bigger pots than the amateur. Occasionally the table is so easy that a professional can overrun it and win the vast majority of pots because the opposition simply fold too much under pressure.

If you play the odds, in a sensible way, it is highly likely that you will win more than you lose over time.

Thanks for the link. According to Hunt affidavit, there r photo(s) of TH on Dassey computer, but date of origin is unknown. He specifically disputes Fassbenders claim the photo(s) were uploaded on April 18, 2006. Seems like again Fassbender is bending some facts to protect BoD. As someone commented, the date the TH photo(s) were uploaded is extremely significant. Has anyone seen the TH photo(s) from Dassey computer? I curious if it was taken at salvage yard during previous visit or a public photo circulated after she went missing. McCrary affidavit states that that a number of images were deleted during the multiple time frames that TH went to the salvage yard including her last visit. Seems to me the implication is photos were possibly taken by BoD of TH (unknowingly) during previous visits. Seems like much more than a coincidence that deletions were made during exact time frames TH was at salvage yard. If proven true, extremely incriminating and clearly exculpatory. Then add in folders like DNA and TH. Seems like walls closing in on BoD.

I actually tried this when I had 15 tabs and my clear pen on me. The cop pulled me over because I have no insurance and a restricted license since I just recently got out of jail for a weed charge and he saw me leave the bar not work(I wasn't drinking. I stopped up there for a half hour after work to bs with my coworker) and he asked to search I said "Sorry officer I don't consent to searches." and he said no need to apologize and ran my plates. By this time there were 4 cops. 2 different city cops and 2 county cops and I thought I for sure was getting searched. He gave me a ticket for the restricted license, didn't search me and let me off on the insurance so I made out pretty good especially considering I already have a record but I just got my med card so I'm finally straight if I get pulled over with weed.

It could legitimately just be their charge calling reports every time for all I know.

Bodywork as work which takes the body as its immediate site of labour includes forms of service work, healthcare and caring. While work on bodywork has undeniably foregrounded the body, at the same time it has worked with a relatively limited understanding of bodily knowledges and practices. This article uses a theoretical framework taken from writing on NonRepresentational Theory, by Human Geographers, in order to take seriously body knowledge such as energy. The article draws on data from indepth interviews conducted with therapeutic massage practitioners in order to take seriously the ways in which energy directs and shapes the work that these bodyworkers do, adding new empirical understandings of what working with energy entails. It makes a broader conceptual contribution to bodywork literatures, advocating the importance of extending analysis beyond social constructionist approaches and questioning the takenforgranted understandings of materiality that are most often drawn upon in order to attend to the kinds of knowledge that are less easy to formalise, anomalous, or that push at the fringes of the definite or the limits of the believable, but which are nonetheless central to many different kinds of bodywork contemporarily.

I was fortunate enough to finally see a restored version on TCM back in October. The literal freak show aspect aside, it's a very entertaining thriller/horror film that has more heart than it should.

I think one of the most missed points in any of these arguments is that under the current system we simply pay a middle man to administer our Healthcare (insurance company). How does removing a middle man from the equation hurt the hospitals or Healthcare workers? The answer is, it doesn directly. Determining procedure pay out rates and tax rates for citizens has a greater and direct impact on how well our system thrives. Removing this middle man administrative cost frees up alot of money to reduce overall cost and get money directly into the hands of health care professionals and to reduce overall cost to US citizens.

If you want your best chance of winning money, play poker. In casino style poker, you aren playing against the casino, so the game isn rigged against you (meaning all the players theoretically have the same chance of winning). The casino makes it revenue from poker by taking a rake (a small percentage of every pot) so no one at the table has an inherent advantage over another.. 
The ads are on display in Facebook Inc.'s virtual game Town, as Honda advertises on the social network site for the first time today. The game, which allows users to collect and customize cars, has 3.1 million users. It was released on Facebook two weeks ago by Cie Games Inc.

As far as Atlantis goes I know the commonly accepted theory is that Plato was talking about a fictional place. A couple of comments are saying he explicitly stated that in the book? I don remember that part, but it has been awhile so I def double check. But there are also older maps that show Atlantis in the NW part of Africa right below the Atlas Mountains. Near there is a natural formation called the Richat structure or the "Eye of the Sahara". It looks pretty interesting in google earth. It is not too hard to imagine before a large climate shift/Catastrophe that its lower lying rings could have been filled with water and connected to a waterway that could easily access the ocean. Plato does have quite a fairly amount of detailed information that he said was passed down to him from Solon and was originally in an Egyptian temple documenting the history of Atlantis. The description matches word for word to the site with fairly eerie accuracy from what I can tell. For example the 3 colors of the stones in the city. On the ground at the Richat there is rubble everywhere with those 3 exact colors. There are also specific distances in Plato account when he talks about the layers of the city and it ring like shape. They match really well with this natural structure. I not sold on the Atlantis part, but it is really really fun.

For Group RRSP and Defined Contribution plans, your fund choices should match up with the goals, risk tolerance and time frame you using for your other accounts.

The result will be a more growth oriented portfolio that appropriate for your situation.

Looking back over my geological career, I realise how lucky I was to be a working scientist during the later part of the twentieth century when ideas on the nature of the Earth underwent a revolution. When I was a student in the early 1960s, the idea of continental drift was regarded by many people as laughable. Twenty years later the concept of plate tectonics was widely accepted, and it started to be appreciated that the older rocks in New Zealand were a fragment of the ancient Gondwana continent.

Ah, but we do have 100% certain "simple" models (simple in a sense that a 2nd year Physics student can verify models validity and one can actually measure the effect in lab conditions). Just assume static atmosphere, ignore climatic feedback loops and double CO2, what happens? Turns out: a fairly significant warming happens: 1.2CAnd another thing: we are also 100% certain that humans are adding planetary scale amounts of CO2 to atmosphere. IIRC a generally accepted estimate is about 40GT (giga tons) of CO2 per year (which adds something like 2% to the total CO2 content for the whole damn planet per_year).

The root of the issue goes back to 1992, when the Food and Drug Administration   which regulates CSL   recommended plasma collection companies screen out men and trans women who have had sex with men.

Source for this is a lovely article "Colonial School Books" by Clifton Johnson in the New England Magazine, volume 30, 1904, who sifted and read his way through a number of primers and turned out this work by "Fenning", which urns out to be Daniel Fenning of the Universal Spelling Book, first printed in 1762. This turns out to have been a best seller and kin to another British speller, Thomas Dilworth New Guide to the English Tongue (70+ editions in American before 1800!), both of which dominated the market until the first American born speller was written by Daniel Webster in 1783.

My best friend, 20, is a delusional 'artist' who needs to grow up. IMO, a best friend is someone who supports you and puts up with your shit. If you are doing anything that is egregiously bad, they will try to talk some sense into you   but love you through the ups and downs. Your friend is 20. That is a kid. However, you don know their potential and you don know whether they will be successful. It not sunshine and rainbow worlds that make people succeed in an arts based career. Also, pretty much anyone who has ever made it against the odds will tell you that you have to try. I can imagine telling someone to grow up, get real and accept they will never succeed as an artist at 20 years old. If you read up on successful contemporary artists   most did not taste any success until late 20s or 30s. Very few people have even come into their own at 20   they are still finding their "voice". All this aside, why are you so critical of someone who is supposed to be your best friend? This isn your BF or GF or spouse. You are not supporting them financially.

I really want it to be this year, but I don think so. I do agree with you about them all coming out in about the same year. I just keep having this stupid extra realist voice in my head saying 2020 because I think that is when the new consoles will come out. I more than willing to bet Sony and Microsoft approached their respective people and told them what up and negotiated next gen releases for Cyperpunk 2077, Starfield, and Death Stranding (even though I believe it is only a Sony game). These are big titles and the companies will want big name games for their new consoles release to help with sales, especially with the high price tag they will likely have. As a side note, I also think Ghosts of Tsushima will be a next gen release for PlayStation.

No, you two are not at the 4 year mark. Talk to him about this again now, at the 3.5 and 4 year mark. After 4 years is when he may want to get engaged. IMO, after living for someone for 3 years you should know them pretty well by now. He may want to get married but may be really nervous about making it a legal marriage with a marriage license. Men are really gun shy about marriage now because so many women use the divorce laws as a weapon, not a shield, and this has been going on for 40 years.

I have accepted it now, but still think its a bit of a bummer, partially because my grandparents were from Poland and our family is kind of marked by having lost everything in the Holocaust, so my parents hold onto what we have from the grandparents (after they relocated after the war) very dearly.

But the feminist, marxist, queer, and critical race academics pooh poohed the objectivists methods and their supposed objectivity as missing just how embedded their scholarship and laws were.

And of course the biggest danger is that the "youth" of America, who are apparently the audience for "Gossip Girl," might get the idea that our bad, bad sex is actually okay.

By that logic should we only be taking in poor unfortunate peoples once the country is PERFECT and poverty is ERADICATED? Do you think that that is actually possible? Or is that a convenient way to say that taking in refugees is something not worth doing. Nations that are taking in refugees simultaneously tackle taking care of their own, and this doesn have to overlap because they are dealing with extremely broad requirements. We can save every single refugee, but we do commit to a quota and have them undergo an extremely long process to make it here.

Hey. Saw this topic and wanted to let you know this: age doesn mean anything! I sure everyone hears those rare cases of 16 year old singers, drummers, producers or even DJs, but thats it, those are rare. Only happen by mere chance.

Like I said, these are examples for NO ONE simply because in these cases these very young artists never worked really hard to get there, never developed an ear for music, especially if you considering music production, which requires long years of practice. Oh, and I talking about this very moment, where the industry is most competitive because everyone can be a producer or artist (which is good, because you can access many tools easily nowadays, and at same time bad because there is lots of junk out there too).

A big part of today's e commerce landscape is the affiliate program (also known as associate programs). This area was pioneered by Amazon. Amazon allows anyone to set up a specialty book store. When people buy books from the specialty store, the person who owns the specialty bookstore gets a commission (up to 10 percent of the book's list price) from Amazon. The affiliate program gives Amazon great exposure because it now has over 1,000,000 specialty bookstores all over the Web [ref]. Therefore this model is now copied by thousands of e commerce sites. If you are setting up an e commerce site you will want to consider an affiliate program as one way to get exposure. Link Share is a company that helps e commerce sites set up affiliate programs.

This is ridiculous. The amount of game breaking bugs is ridiculous and I have never seen that newly launched game. however I did not play Mass effect Andromeda or Fallout 76 but the Anthem76 meme seems to be quite accurate. The third big patch after launch on March 12th will now fix more than 300 bugs that have not been addressed before. On one hand this shows Biowares dedication and I admire that but on the other hand it also shows how broken the game still is.
Note that regardless, you want a bunch of roboports close to the loading chests, and if you use active providers on the mining patch, roboports around the ore patch as well.

The respective militaries in the US and Pakistan share a common contempt for the sloth of civilian deliberation and argumentation. They share a common contempt for the popularity of blood and guts politicians, even if, in the case of the United States, that popularity is a product of a transformative election. And even if, in the case of Pakistan, that popularity only increases every time the military does something to make it decrease. They also share a common respect for the institutions they represent, the sacrifices their soldiers make on the battlefield and the love for country and flag that each military stands for.

I wish I knew who you are. Curiosity is killing me. But anyway, you could always be like a Batman or something. Just configure a whole secret identity and do that. We could trade places for awhile if you want. I have five cats, unemployed, and I binge eat. You could totally hide out here and no one would be the wiser. You get a cool set of flip flops and everyone calls you "the cat lady". Other than that, you could always get into video games or something, create an online identity and just make friends through there. Anywho, sorry you hate being famous. I would hate all of that too, but, I bet you look a lot better half naked on your couch than I do in my living room watching every series of everything on Netflix. So you win. Have you considered blogging?

Susan Kaye, a therapist working in Philadelphia and Austin, Texas, works with surrogates "below the horizon" for a practical reason   she can't even find certified surrogates in her areas. "I have gotten around it by working with people who are 'body workers,' people I have trained on what I want them to do with clients." "Body work," as Kaye defines it, excludes intercourse, but can include genital touching and genital massage. While patients with a regular sex partner can do therapy "homework," single men and women, who, after all, might be single because they need sex therapy, don't have study buddies. Even a partnered man or woman trying to work out a fetish, or someone who has been raped or assaulted and can't stand being touched could use a surrogate.

If I were considering more schools in this area, I personally wouldn't have bothered applying to this medical school not because it's competitive (spoiler, it is.

You want to do deals, you want things to happen now. You love the rush of the negotiation, the chance to make it big (or go home with nothing). So, do you bet the No Pass which has slightly better odds than the Pass but draws the ire of the person standing next to you who thinks you bring negative vibes to the table? Or, do you not care about what others think?. 
Sure variance matters since I want to know how likely I am to loose my entire roll, but it obvious on its face that it easier to go bust in a game with uncapped betting than one with a cap. CV is what players are really talking about when they talk about swinginess (how likely is it that I go on a sustained downswing where I continue to lose despite my edge?). You can really play loose aggressive in limit holdem, so everyone plays tight, but a tight player has more variance in limit holdem than no limit imo. 
"The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will. United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West's critical facilities in the event of a conflict. They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated. In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants."

A long term relationship can still be fun if you work on it. If you have differences (which are inevitable), settle them as soon as you can. Don't sleep on a marital argument.

I think that you should consider counselling or speaking to a psychologist. You shouldn't be afraid to be in your own home. Anxiety and stress wear on you quickly and make it harder for you to be the mum that your DD needs. Speaking to a professional will help you develop the mental tools that you need to deal with your MIL without losing your mind. They will also be able to provide you with an outside opinion from someone who is looking out for your best interests.
Instead of making a big raise, say $50,000 from the button, I folded my hand. That's not how you win tournaments. Another time, I found myself making a big raise with pocket sixes when I was one off the button, and then calling when the 70,000 man, now in the small blind, moved all in with A 10.

Depression, anxiety and high blood pressure medications can have a negative impact on libido as well. And, of course, women can experience a decline in libido without any of these things being involved. 
A school is also going to have a certified teaching staff. I don think a certified teacher is always going to be better than a daycare staff   but they are going to have more education background and are more likely to be doing it as a career rather than a job. There should be some educational theory or philosophy beyond just taking care of the children..
