While playing no limit Hold'em, your first instinct will probably be to move all in when you see pocket aces. In a typical game, this will win you the pot, but you will likely win only the blinds since everyone else probably folded.

In the case of catastrophic failure like a pec tear or a hand slip sidespotters still wouldnt be able to react in time before the bar drops on someones chest.

Another solution to this problem is to simply allow concealed carry permit holders to carry their guns everywhere, so they don't have to stow them be their vehicles. Since this demographic has the single lowest instance of crime out of all those who possess guns, even less than police, this would be more reasonable than leaving the guns to be stolen by these poor kids who really didn't even have a choice but to steal the guns. I mean they were only stored behind multiple locks. It's like the gun owners we're begging them to steal their guns. You might even say they were asking for it.

A judge can get a reprimand, which doesn do much except allow for him to be blasted in the press.

The economy will continue to tank as public resources dwindle, private investment follows. Pallister will serve on dozens of boards and spend just enough time in Canada to take advantage of socialized health care when he wants to.
In September 2009, Toyota announced a new "self repairing" clear coat finish that's poised to roll out on their new Lexus models. What makes it possible is a secret proprietary ingredient. Whatever this magic ingredient is, Toyota claims that it promotes a closer molecular bond within the paint. This makes it very dense, while improving its flexibility and elasticity. These characteristics make the coat less prone to damage from the sun's UV rays and acid from things like rain and bird droppings. The flexibility also allows minor surface blemishes to be self restored. The new breakthrough requires no extra care to help protect the paint job from losing its luster and gloss.

Players reach equilibrium play by tracking regrets for past plays, making future plays proportional to positive regrets. The technique is not only simple and intuitive; it has sparked a revolution in computer game play of some of the most difficult bluffing games, including clear domination of annual computer poker competitions.Since the algorithm is relatively recent, there are few curricular materials available to introduce regret based algorithms to the next generation of researchers and practitioners in this area.

I removed your comment. A quick Googling suggests to me that in many jurisdictions what you described is either an assault or a battery. (No, I not a lawyer, so I not very clear on the difference either, sorry.) What that means is that your comment then becomes a credible and possible suggestion that the OP do something that could land them in a lot of legal trouble, not simply a funny odoriferous means of in law repellent.

3. Where the regulation since the collapse of the banking system? Why didn Bernanke limit the amount of interest banks could charge ordinary Americans at say 15% (which is what credit unions charge) instead of still letting them charge 30%?

And my advice would be to pick your are very carefully. 
Was it to channel the anger he may have felt? Instead of getting him help? Was it the FBI who created this scenario and how it was going to play out?

I was tired and thirsty and carelessly bought a big bottle of water. Got back in the bus. As we were pulling away, I opened it and heard that "psssst" you get when opening a carbonated drink.

Now, 33 goals as a 40 year old is a high order, even for the Russian machine. But keep in mind: he's a 50+ goal scorer right now. There's no reason to think his production will plummet instead of tailing off like normal. So: let's say he has a similarly productive season to now in the 2019 2020 season, and then tails off consistently for the next six seasons:

Similarly, if you drinking at a bar but at a table rather than at the bar itself, bring your empty glasses to the bar when you go to refill!! So much easier for the bartenders, not to mention in a packed bar if everyone did this, it would make things hella quicker by not having the dilemma of no glasses and/or a busy bartender running around the eating space to grab glasses to clean. ALSO   as a slightly above 5 tall woman, empty glasses in front of me at the bar makes me more noticeable than I would normally be that I need another drink. Also ALSO   it gives you a chance/excuse to sneak in where people are sipping on full drinks AT the bar to get to the front. Lastly, if I were the bartender I would truly appreciate this (just good karma) and thereby might at least consider giving you priority.

Suppose your net income is $30,000, for example. You would need at least $900 of medical expenses to reach the three per cent threshold before the first dollar counts.

It depends on how much you are examining their hand analysis and where you are in your poker journey. I think there is a lot of value to be had in a poker vlog. You can pause the video, and ask yourself at each action what you would do, and then get affirmation or see what the vlogger did and listen to their explanation as to why. Some are better at this, and some focus more on the analysis than the entertainment value. If you are going to watch Trooper or Boski, then you aren going to get more detailed explanations than someone like Brad Owen. Even then, their explanations might not be too educational, but generally the vloggers are winning poker players and there are some useful nuggets of information. LATB has some crazy action, and the best players are on the Friday stream. That being said, the plays that the Friday players do aren stuff that I would pull in the local 1/2 game.

The basic principle of the game is known as "ABC Poker".

I was brought up/taught (and have observed in basic civil society as a norm) that it is always polite to say "please", "thank you", and to not interrupt when someone is talking. This level of respect and politeness increases the closer the relationship you have with someone   eg: you want to be more polite to someone you care about, because, well, you care about them. (Admittedly the interruption thing can sometimes prove difficult if the person is going on and on, but it still a matter of politeness and respect to me to let them finish).

Muscles are the "engine" that your body uses to propel itself. Absolutely everything that you conceive of with your brain is expressed as muscular motion. The only ways for you to express an idea are with the muscles of your larynx, mouth and tongue (spoken words), with the muscles of your fingers (written words or "talking with your hands") or with the skeletal muscles (body language, dancing, running, building or fighting, to name a few).. 
While playing baccarat at the Borgata in 2012, Ivey and Cheng Yin Sun identified inconsistencies on the back of the cards that helped them determine their value.While it had already been determined that Ivey and his colleague did not mark the cards and did not commit fraud, the court ruled that they failed to abide by the Casino Controls Act because they asked various dealers to arrange the cards so Sun could get a better look at them, thereby creating an advantage.Ivey, 39, had argued in a court filing that he never touched the cards.

For someone who has grown up in the modern world, the city of Rome, even after its redevelopment by Augustus, was not a particularly pleasant place. I actually posit that the gladiatorial contests would be one of the most recognizable   and even accepted   things in modern society. There were rules, there was a referee, and, while certainly a blood sport, a gladiatorial contest was more about fighters coming out on top, rather than the loser actually dying (which was reasonably rare   current estimates are that 80 90% of losers in any of these contests went on to fight again). The arenas were large, with some reserved seating, awnings to protect the audience from the sun, raucous fans, and vendors selling overpriced food. Yeah that part isn terrifically civilized.

I actually get injected with fluorescent yellow dye at one point and put in a sensory deprivation room after which they test my eyes. It was wild pretty much every test that exists they threw at me; they came to the conclusion it must be neurological and sent me away.

Treating your cat's case of ear mites is a three step process. The first step is to get as many tiny critters out of the ear canal as possible by cleaning the ear. You can use an ear cleaning solution (available at pet supply stores) or try almond or olive oil, but clear the latter with your vet first. Put several drops of the solution or oil into the ear canal and massage gently. Massaging will help bring debris up to the outer part of the ear where it can be wiped away with a cotton ball or tissue. Do not use cotton swabs, because one slip could puncture an eardrum. Repeat the cleaning procedure until the debris is gone.

You can do a google of what betting the tote board means but it basically when you look for value and patterns by watching the odds change for horses before a race. 3. Don place bets more than 3 minutes before a race if you can.

My wife and I attended the funeral of a guy we had played poker with for years. I mean, 4 nights a week for 6 years! When we walked in and went to sign the guest book, my wife suddenly got a case of the giggles, out of nowhere! Now, we had spent a lot of time around this dude, and laughed a lot with the guy over the years, but his family was mortified. I had to walk my wife out, through his entire family, while she was laughing so hard she was snorting and crying. 
President of the League, Mike Carver, was there to oversee matters and to fill in the scorecard, while Vice Chairman, Garth Hill, was there to chalk the board. Garth is reknowned around the skittling community for his below than average timekeeping although to be fair he was there before 9pm. Skipper Hake had lost the toss so we were elected to go 2nd. Young Lambs made a good start of 69, but thanks to steady 8's 9's and a 13 spare from Reel 'em In we made 71 to go 2 up. Our second hand was even better as Billy (17) and Food Chain (14) were the stars in a 78 hand which pulled 13. Young Lambs third hand stuttered to 61, while the Wanderers pulled 7 more on the hand thanks to a 14 spare from The Pistol to put us in a very strong position of being 22 ahead.
Went back the next week and decided to take advantage of the priests hearing confession before mass. Now if you don know the Catholic ritual for confession, you basically start by saying "Bless me Father for I have sinned, it has been (X amount for time) since my last confession."

My best friend kiddo had his fourth birthday at a petting zoo thing, and they had a baby/toddler kangaroo that they let hop around and let everyone pet and feed him.

Zhao agreed with Gold, but put a historical and cultural perspective to the risks IP rights face in China. IP thefts have been rampant in China for a long time, and the thinking behind that is, 'If I see something good, I want to do it, too,' said Zhao.

For example, "That's a nice car!" which could be answered with a simple "yes, it is," for most people and they'd let it go, unless they have something else to say about it. He replied with "Hey?" to which you have to respond with a more elaborate "Yes, it's a great car, I really like the colour," or something, and if you don't he just keeps going "Hey? Hey? Are you even listening to me?" and if you do answer he still replies with "Hey?" and expects you to come up with yet another thing to say about the car. If you dare to change the subject, it's "I wasn't taking about THAT. I'm talking about THIS CAR!" Well, I'm sorry I wanted to talk about something else now?

I do see men complaining that feminists want to prohibit them from doing manly stuff they like, but have yet to see anyone actually propose anything like that. Instead, I've seen calls to allow men, too, to be themselves, without constrictive social norms saying "you can't do that or people will call you a faggot". You want to grow a beard, wear plaid and chop wood? By all means. Just accept that if someone prefers to do ballet, that doesn't make them any less of a man or more of a faggot. And you should not view them as "less than" because of different preferences.
"In the context of the Pledge, the statement that the United States is a nation "under God" is an endorsement of religion. It is a profession of a religious belief, namely, a belief in monotheism. The recitation that ours is a nation "under God" is not a mere acknowledgment that many Americans believe in a deity. Nor is it merely descriptive of the undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of the Republic. Rather, the phrase "one nation under God" in the context of the Pledge is normative. To recite the Pledge is not to describe the United States; instead, it is to swear allegiance to the values for which the flag stands: unity, indivisibility, liberty, justice, and   since 1954   monotheism. The text of the official Pledge, codified in federal law, impermissibly takes a position with respect to the purely religious question of the existence and identity of God. A profession that we are a nation "under God" is identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation "under Jesus," a nation "under Vishnu," a nation"under Zeus," or a nation "under no god," because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion."

So, to your point, its bizarre and interesting to me that we dont really meet the other Tyrell brothers other than Loras. Garlan is a real G, from what we know, and Willas(?)
