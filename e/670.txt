If it's ITB, you'll feel like you're hitting your head against a brick wall foam rolling or stretching it. Instead foam roll, massage do whatever to TFL and Glute max as both those muscles fascia/tendons continue to form itb. Sometimes patients can be compensating abduction with TFL instead of glute med so make sure you're queuing glute med properly (I suggest doing glute med hip hikes/ or do long lever clams with internal rotation of the hip). 
For real it a good thing that guy told you the real reason the prof invited you to his place in other words, he wasn helping you out of the goodness of his heart he was doing some downlow scheming and using his position to creep on you, a naive student, and of course you didn know that until this guy schooled you on what the prof real motivations were.

1 point  submitted 1 day agoWhat if there no church within distance that the person fully agrees with? For example, this gentleman seems to be one hundred percent okay with the Anglican view of things except the ordination of women and, if I may infer, probably LGBT affirmation. What are the odds of another denomination having that exact set of opinions? ACNA and those schisms are really small and I don know if they even exist in GB. I don think it would be fair to argue that this person should go without communion or group worship.

Lorre's CSI episode centers on the murder of a crazy, stupid, alcoholic, abrasive female comedian who forces men to have sex with her to keep their jobs, and who so happens to star on a show that greatly resembles Roseanne. The show goes out of its way to say that no one ever liked the woman, and the only person who pretends to care about the crime is the killer, who goes free due to a lack of proof..

If I were you, I work on retraining the command "Monty" but also stop using his name for anything else. If you want him to come, use your command for come (and remember not to call a dog for anything bad like a bath, better to just lure them to you with a treat than to spoil the "come" command), if you want him to get off of something use them command for "off" or drop/leave something alone, say "drop it"/"leave it" (assuming you already taught these commands).

He explicitly advocated for violence against his political rivals and members of the press who do not bow to him. 90% of republican still support him. I consider that explicit endorsement by 90% of the republicans to use violence on people that trump finds disagreeable. They won find it bad if say, the Clintons are murdered tomorrow by Russian operatives on US soil. I think they might even help the FSB agents. That endorsement also tells me that there is only a fine line to cross before they start doing the violence themselves.

If you at home I would imagine your SO won have an issue telling you if what you doing is hurting them.If you work too deep into the muscle you can bruise them or cause minor tissue damage. If you work to hard over the kidneys it will hurt.Nothing really life threatening.So watch their posture, if you notice any squirming, breath holding or sharp intakes of breath (just think about all the things you do when something hurts you) adjust your pressure. Sometimes just using a broader surface area like the palm of your hand instead of the very tips of your fingers will make a huge difference.I would avoid anything traction like; don pull on any joints.Otherwise have atter!

I often think it important to really delineate sections of a piece of music really well to make it catchy. Sia "Chandalier" is a good example of this.

The acceptable level of power depends on the effect size you want to detect in your data, so that could mean 3 replicates is enough for one experiment, but 6 is required for another.

The house is about 15 minutes southwest of the airport. It is reasonably close to downtown and all of the sites. The house has 4 large, clean bedrooms along with 2.5 bathrooms. Each BR has a television. We were surprised to learn that the owners lived in the basement due to no one mentioning it in earlier reviews. The freezer kept fluctuating in temperature with a small puddle as a result. I have seen scratch and dent fridges before but this one took the cake, While the front was nice, the bottom looks like it had been beaten in with a sledgehammer. The dishwasher also leaked into the owner's basement area. The front door was worked on due to it not having a doorknob and then it turned into a larger job due to a problem. The furnace failed to heat the first floor adequately and on the first cold night, we really felt it. It was also taken care of. The owner, Ambrose, is extremely attentive, kind and understanding. We arrived into Atlanta early and he had no problem with us checking in early. He kept us up to date, via text, on the problems and when they were repaired, if necessary. The washing machines were great to use and the laundry room is on the second floor!! Beds were very clean and comfortable. A nice, roomy place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. If it weren't for the problems encountered, we would probably given it 5 stars (but four is still good). The owner Ambrose, is a gentleman, and I give him 5 stars. If you have no problem with the owner and his family living in the basement, I highly recommend Ambrose's home.

George W. Bush abandoned his studied air of mild sedation only once during his prime time press conference last week. vote on Iraq. A poker metaphor escaped from his Inner Cowboy.

And I don disagree outright, but the approach to the philosophies of problem solving couldn be more different, especially contrasting the Stump Blasting pamphlet with the Stump Removal one produced by a chain manufacturer. So how does it come to pass that someone ostensibly trying to write a history of science blog that has been changed to a history of ideas blog finds himself at almost midnight on a Sunday plugging away on a post about zipper repair and stump blasting? (And how often to do those five words come together in a sentence? ) Simple: its about the methodology and the approach to figuring out a problem.

The college doesn really provide any facilities for engineering students to study or really any facilities useful to engineering students at all besides the ECC. This turns the library into 70% engineering students, which would be okay if the culture in the library was to study and not just to watch netflix in the silent section and talk "quietly" to your friends while others are trying to complete their degree. For this reason I recommend studying in the Law Library as I think the whole thing is one big silent section. (While students in colleges like Bauer have there own study halls and lounges.) Until UH and the Cullen College of Engineering address this point specifically, the university will not get a dime from me after I graduate.

I don't know anything for certain about the legality of playing online. My lay understanding is this: (1) Congress forbade banks from transferring money to many kinds of poker sites; (2) although this does not criminalize playing at those sites, (3) it does effectively filter out the fish, making it much harder to skim an easy profit than it had been in 2004.. 
Since OP asked where could he improve, I gonna chime in since no one is answering, you all are mostly just circle jerking. 3 bet larger pre for value at these lower stakes. Most villains will call when dominated like this hand. Flop and turn play are great if we are playing online. Your mistake in this hand was not reading your opponent in this live setting. Take the time to learn how to do this. At many low stakes live games you can just tell when your opponent is rip roaring and ready to stack off. The tells are very subtle at first but once you train your brain to recognize them, you will be able to make incredible check backs and folds.

This hits home. I am half white but often pass under the radar as full, and live in a fairly "progressive" and "liberal" area, and have heard some fucked up shit among white people (eg at parties) when they think no POC are around.

However, many suicidal people that plan that far ahead? More often then not, they get nervous and scared. I mean, it human to do so. Self preservation instinct kicks in and they suddenly find themselves alone in a dark room in the middle of nowhere. The Bible offers comfort to those during these times. It may not make them religious, but the bible talks about the goodness of humans, and how people should be kind and help others in need. To someone suicidal, it may convince them to seek help.

My guess is this is a single phase motor with two to cap, two to power, and one is a frame or chassis ground, three phase with capacitor is rare and normally if a cap is used for a three phase motor, it is in a separate "box" the cap is used to form a "false" third leg and is used to create rotation, but is of little use past beginning rotation, these setups should be used with caution as the motor HP is usually derated by a significant factor, example 1/2 horse three phase with false third leg, may only be powerful enough to operate less than half the rated horsepower on a legitimate three phase power supply.

I going to guess that the episode of which you speak is "In Theory", and I agree. Some of the stories on Trek were really hampered by having to retain the status quo at the end of every episode. When that kind of episodic narrative is able to he lifted, and characters can have throughlines that may have repercussions, then you able to get stories like "A Happy Refrain". Just think of how much more poignant and heartbreaking "Identity" is after that episode: that not something that TNG could really deliver on.

Game choice is terrific because you've got the ability, at the touch of a couple of fingers, to move around inside a internet site and from web page to site trying to find good games. Where the typical casino poker area rake in recent times tends to be about 10% of the pot with a $4 or, increasingly, a $5 maximum per hand; on line rooms are frequently 5% having a $3.00 maximum   or even considerably significantly less within the incredibly low stakes rooms. In fact, within the micro stakes rooms with betting limits of $.10 per bet or less, there is certainly occasionally no rake.

El Potro debuted in 2006 with a location in Somerville's Union Square, and most recently opened a larger space in Malden.

As far as moisturizers go, I like The Ordinary's NMF a lot, as I found it very gentle (it was one of very few moisturizers that didn't hurt my Accutane skin). Stratia Liquid Gold is a favorite around here, for good reason   it has exactly the kinds of ingredients that help heal painfully damaged skin. It's what I'm using now that I'm on retin a. And you might try mixing an oil in with a simpler cream (like the NMF or CeraVe PM) to give it a little extra oomph. I really like marula oil; it feels very nourishing.
That is a great idea. My PCP treated me for years and had me on oxycodone. I never failed a drug test or pill count. After 5 years, though, it just wasn working anymore.

I think the whole thing pissed my doctor off that I no longer wanted her to treat my pain. All of a sudden I getting a hostile call from her office, asking me to drive in 1.5 hour to a specific pharmacy in another county and do a pill count. My husband wasn home and he had the car. (I was recovering from surgery. I couldn drive.) I called him to come and get me. Literally on his way to the house he and my 4 year old daughter were in a car crash. They were stopped at a light and a dude plowed into him going 55. It was a 3 car pile up. Totaled our car and the car in front of him. He and our daughter had to go to the hospital. I had the police report, the hospital report, AND a note from my insurance company documenting the wreck and the time. Still, a week later I got "fired" from my PCP office for missing the pill count. Not only did I get fired she fired my 2 kids as well.

Martingale usually involves doubling your bet with each loss, and it doesn work because you don have an unlimited bankroll. 1 out of 32 trials you will lose 5 consecutive coin flips, and give up the profit from the previous 31 wins. 1 out of 256 trials you will lose 7 in a row, and you will give up the profit from the last 255 flips, etc. Yours is a modified, and swingier, version of Martingale, but the result would be the same. In the long run you will eventually encounter a string of no long enough such that your next required bet would be larger than your remaining bankroll, or larger than the table limit.

I would always be happy to give him his cut of my winnings. I was learning programming at around 23, while playing on a friends stake to make ends meet. Thankfully I don't have to grind for a living anymore, but I always felt he was proud that I became decent at a game he taught me.

Similarly in poker, for decades, the highest level of pokers have been dominated by players who have learned the game by playing it, "road gamblers" who have cultivated intuition for the game and are adept at reading other players' hands from betting patterns and physical tells. 
The inclusion of "God" in the pledge and the exclusion of "equality" seem to be the reverse of the original intention of the pledge unless of course the necessity of counterplay against godless Communists is still a requisite for a statement of fidelity to what the American flag represents not to mention the separation intentions of the Founding Fathers.1.

Slot players usually cash out by pushing a button to print out a bar coded ticket. That ticket can be used in another machine or redeemed for cash at the cashier's cage or cash kiosk. The player's one unit bet stays on the table until the outcome is determined. If the player wins, he or she wins 35 units and gets to keep the original bet for a total of 36 units. But in video poker, the payoff for three of a kind is usually 3 for 1. Even at games with house percentages of less than 1 percent, there will be times the player just can't win. The worst thing a player can do is to start chasing losses, gambling money needed elsewhere in an attempt to win back money that's already gone.

The risk based argument for the value premium didn't sit well with me as a Ben Graham aficionado.

Well, first off as a bloke, of course there is the penis himself But not just the penis, often the centre of attention, the testicles can be left dangling and of course beyond the testicles (wow, a moovie name; Beyond Testicle) ?We have that nice little area between the ends of the scrotum and anus all those areas are rather nice To the Penis itself, of course I'm sure we all know the 'tip' of the penis is most sensitive as it has a greater number of nerve endings. I do not know how much discourse we need on the penis as we have probably covered a fair bit of that.

The June date being a reference to Obergefell, when the Supreme Court forced the legality of same sex marriage in every state. Reading a book prominently recognizing lynchings in the south, reading about how in 1963, while searching for the corpses of 3 civil rights activists the search party stumbled across the lynched corpses of 8 unreleated black men pounded home the hell out of the pervasiveness of racism helped me formulate my thoughts on how ludicrous it is to think legal changes ended racism and its impact on politics, the notion that anti LGBT bigotry ended with Obergefell is ludicrous.

What's the difference between an amateur and a professional when it comes to poker playing? Professionals consistently win. Do you want to win like a pro? Professional poker players are professionals for a good reason   their professionals. They weren't always that way.

These three traits will dramatically increase your earnings. Lets get to it and learn them.

However, the 1000 Paulson Pharoah Casino Top Hat Poker Chips with Aluminum Case was full of enlightening responses from our guests. Sure, there were jokes thrown in like, "Look it's James Bond", or "These Beer Poker Chips are incredible". That's because the aluminum case looks like something that just came out of the movies. You know, where the bad guys are making a transaction with an aluminum case full of money? Well, they may use something different, but this is the kind of appeal it gives off to others.

The real value of the Post series is that the facts and figures coming out might shame politicians in Washington to investigate and possibly limit some of these excesses. Real shift in American priorities and spending would require a lot more than facts and figures. Would require a revolution.

However, in my opinion I think the series would be a lot more entertaining if Pyrion sat down with the lads and explained to them how to play Poker competently. It would only have to be a quick 30 minute course where the basics would be covered, things like limping, bet sizing, ranges, etc. In my opinion the tournament would be a lot more entertaining if the standard of play was slightly higher and in terms of promoting the Pokerist app, I think it would look better if the audience could see clear progression in the players abilities and skill at the felt. At the break in the last stream when Pyrion gave Sjin a few tips on when to fold and to basically tighten up a bit, the game became much more enjoyable. It's just a suggestion though, I love what you guys are doing and keep up the great work!
Also if bullying is of extreme level (I know this is stupid statement considering I am quantifying a qualitative property, but you get the gist of it) tell your parents and/elder sisters and hope that parents just don say to her balantly to "stop doing that" because only a good conversation can resolve this.

While on his journey to the sobriety that he wanted so badly, he met Laura Child Smith. She helped him and encouraged him, and after a period of 'getting to know you' time, they got married on December 22, 2016. The Leishman family gained three more members, Laura and her two sons, Beck and Owen. David was an amazing 'bonus dad'. He loved Beck and Owen very much and they loved him. They always had so much fun working with him on the tractor and playing claw games. He used to call Beck "Lord Becklington. Joey and Owen would always be playing together so he called them "Jowen". He taught the boys how to play poker and they loved watching baking shows with him.
Some rules: Nothing but organic waste; that means water, pee, poop, blood. No kitchen food scraps, no wet wipes, no condoms. Highly recomend getting the thin toilet paper that everyone hates.

Oh I totally get this. This is my problem, unfortunately. I have scoured the internet for homeschooling blogs and resources, etc, but things I try never end up working well. Idk who all these kids are who just do whatever their parents tell them to or go along with whatever their mom does. Maybe my son is just extra difficult? I've tried so hard to have him help me prepare meals, but he either never wants to or takes any opportunity to throw something (spices, food, KNIVES OMG) across the room. It was my attempt to get him involved so maybe he'll actually eat a meal I prepare (I'm talking pbj sandwiches, nothin elaborate here lol)

I still think it is fishy. Trump seems to be hard line supporter of Israel and enemy of Iran, recognizing Jerusalem as capital, reinstating sanctions and anything. Yet he apparently pulls off US troops before Iran does it. He would have greater leverage in favor of Israel and against Iran if he stayed longer and stronger in Syria.

Here they are all appealing and work very well as a masterful marketing tool for every product in every facet of the Coke line..

Yes right kind if thought process, except thinking as a computer does, think of tendancies so these tendancies vary between games and stakes, so 1/2 live is very different than 25/50 online, but it will share tendancies with 5nl online, knowing what to expect a population tendancy to be at any given level is a learned skill that will become inhearant as we move up levels, but would still need study as we progressed. We will adjust from the tendancy as intell is gained..

The poker faced, almost docile demeanour of Andy Roberts, who was born today, hid the merciless soul of a great fast bowler. His stock bouncer, quick and nasty, was simply a softener, a prelude to the real thing, which was close to unplayable. Lithe and effortlessly economical in his run up, Roberts did not benefit from coming into a great West Indies side (only one of his first seven five fors came in victory).

Suited Blue Poker Table Cloth Critical Overview
The film has a snappy, witty tone that propels us into the story, with moments of satirical comedy, earthy humour and some exhilarating, inventively staged action. And the reason it works so well is due to the title character: thanks to seamless digital effects, Okja emerges as a smart, playful and brave creature whose bond with Mija is very strong indeed. This adds a powerful emotional kick, balancing the cartoonish but still remarkably textured performances from Swinton and Gyllenhaal. By contrast, An nicely underplays Mija, while Dano and his gang (including Lily Collins and The Walking Dead's Steven Yuen) add an intriguing edge of soulful compassion.
