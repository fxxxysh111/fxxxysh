A little word of advice in case anyone else decides to do the same thing: the laws in Georgia allow a conversation to be recorded without the other parties consent if there is no expectation of privacy, which is the case if you are in the front room of an office that has general admission. However, once you go into a private room in the back that no longer applies. So if you do try to record a conversation, make sure you stop recording before you are invited into the back should that occur.

At least that way they can wash their hands saying "look, we're giving you the full deal that you wanted".I'd say that a second yellow should be an appealable situation.

I did one of the notebooks from Joann's and I used three strands   it worked super well for the dark colors, and was maybe a touch light for the less intense colors. I think if I was doing it again, I might try the less intense color with 4 to see if it would look okay with other stitches using only 3. Still, it turned out well and the person I gave it to likes it, so nifty! One tip in case it didn't occur to you: my SO took the cover off the spirals for me and put it back on when I was done.

That clarification aside, a woman well being should never, ever, ever, EVER be placed second to a fetus. Yes, a fetus is helpless, but it is also not a person yet. Sometimes a decision has to be made. Losing the woman will impact the world significantly more than losing the fetus. If carrying a pregnancy to term will put the woman at risk then that fetus needs to go. If a woman needs treatment but the treatment puts a current or future fetus as risk, then the woman should get the treatment, and if her fertility is affected and she still wants kids some day then there are other options for having a child. The existing human being is more important than the hypothetical one. Forever and always. Hands down. The end.

First of all, to clear up some confusion I see in the comments (which is totally understandable because they so sly when it comes to advertising) it $29.99 each for Internet, TV, and Voice for a total of $89.97 for all three (they never mention 89.97/90 anywhere but only 29.99 each). The catch is you must get all 3 bundles to get that pricing. If you want Internet only, it going to be $45/month for only 60 mbps. You only find out about that if you do some specific searching within their site, everywhere else on the site is spammed with $29.99 in very large font. There are no other options for different speeds/pricing.

Skeletal muscle is the type of muscle that we can see and feel. When a body builder works out to increase muscle mass, skeletal muscle is what is being exercised. Skeletal muscles attach to the skeleton and come in pairs   one muscle to move the bone in one direction and another to move it back the other way. These muscles usually contract voluntarily, meaning that you think about contracting them and your nervous system tells them to do so. Smooth muscle has the ability to stretch and maintain tension for long periods of time. It contracts involuntarily, meaning that you do not have to think about contracting it because your nervous system controls it automatically. It can stretch in a limited way, like smooth muscle, and contract with the force of a skeletal muscle. It is a twitch muscle only and contracts involuntarily.

In the back of my mind is a conversation I had with Bruce Falson, coach of the Australian junior women water polo team in which Lane played at the world championships in Quebec in 1995. At the elite level, water polo is a fast and furious sport, and Falson described her as a formidable competitor. "She was very tough," he said.

When i was a kid i remember harry potter coming out and my parents making a huge deal out of it being witchcraft satanic and evil and i was banned from reading it. i never really questioned it and went almost twenty years without interacting with the books or movies. i read a bit and seen one movie now but its just not that great to me, probably would liked it as a kid but i not connecting with it well as an adult. some things are better right away not later. earlier today i got mcdonalds and i saved my fries for later and they tasted like fried rubber, just terrible limp and wet paste. same deal, parents turned harry potter into a wet floppy fry for me. i thought about calling for a refund but they didnt put the receipt in my bag. typical fast food bamboozle, mcdonalds knows the game. Anyway, glad the psychos that raised me are dead and no one can stop me from smoking a bowl and having a giggle fit over parks and rec reruns. life is full of ups and downs.

Frankie stays, the bomb squad/detonators pairs off into Cody/Derrick and Caleb/Frankie. Derrick and Cody are way too solid together and Caleb and Frankie don stand a chance. Even if they win HOH Derrick could still get into Frankie ear about getting rid of Caleb. From Derrick POV, Frankie is much easier to manipulate than Nicole; him and Frankie are in an alliance so he has reason to trust him, whereas Nicole already made the mistake of trusting him once. The only way Caleb would be secure is if he won HOH.

So how did we come across the Suited Purple Texas Holdem Poker Table Cloth? Well, a couple of my associates went down to the local store, but we could never get a color that really portrayed a somber appeal. This meant we had to find a collection online and since we were running out of money for this project, it had to be something that wasn't too expensive. Amazingly enough, we found a place that offered a perfect match and at a low cost.. 
All cruise guests basically eat the same things: Freezers on board Harmony of the Seas are the size of New York studio apartments, and stocking them is an art form. Before each sailing, the inventory team receives enough ingredients for 20 dining venues, plus servings for the 2,000 member crew. (The total cost, including other consumables such as paper towels, is about $800,000.) Overestimate the order and the voyage becomes less profitable (and wasteful); underestimate and you'll risk a riot over coconut shrimp.. 
There is ample evidence that, in the hands of real people, the shorter driver might very well hit the ball, not just with more accuracy, but more distance as well. For every quarter inch you miss the "sweet spot" on your driver, you loose about five yards in distance. Miss it by a half an inch, you loose about 10 yards, by an inch 20 yards and so on.

Fra Mauro 1450 map was done inverted, so basically the entire known world was drawn in a way that we would consider upside down. This is at odds with how other people rendered the map, but inverted maps are apparently not uncommon for the time, either, as Muslim maps were frequently done that way.

It the worst position. Position is important.

You can basically never fourbet which means you end up playing the hand in a super obvious way aka You win small pots and lose big ones. You get bluffed off or play passive weak guessing poker.

Do you know who I am?? course, as well as Luongo did, he did fail at one thing. He was not the best Luongo at this World Series of Poker.

Perhaps it was due to a more reckless style, or maybe the card talent simply lies with Fabio (I think Fabio would agree with this), either way, the Luongo should be happy with their efforts. As of this posting, Fabio is still alive, so I will update you with his final position when he goes out.

Regardless, it's worth putting up with for the amounts that are raised and it's not nearly as ridiculous as students still being overly outspoken about Joe Paterno, but that's a whole other cult mentality!THON organizations (student run "clubs" basically) get to choose a certain number of dancers every year, usually based on who's participated in their org and contributed a lot to THON since attending Penn State. The lottery is for independent dancers, meaning she was not part of an org. As much as it sucks, there's a lot of people that put in to be an independent dancer and a lot of them raise a ton of money, so it's sorta the only possible way to go about it.

Pregnancy can be a strange time. At any given moment, you may find yourself feeling amazed at the fact that you're, like, creating a new human, only to be freaked out 10 seconds later that your body is stretching beyond recognition in its quest to accommodate that miraculous little being. Your mind races at all hours with concerns that you didn't even know existed six months ago. As your pregnancy progresses, your newfound mental unrest is accompanied by random aches and pains brought on by such strenuous activities as sitting or standing, and you're waking up 17 times a night to complete an elaborate series of maneuvers once known simply as "turning over."

I don't think the problem is so much that it didn't make realistic sense, but that it somewhat undercut the tension of the scene (Bathos). Its a very marvel esque wink at the audience technique, which made the movie feel more similar to the movies being made now than the star wars movies that had come before which is a bit of a problem, since presumably the universe itself hasn't changed. That was kinda my problem with the movie JJ obviously loves star wars given that he made every effort to include all the aesthetic and surface level details of the OT (stormtroopers, a rebellion, ect), but the tone, direction, cinematography, writing, ect.

Reporting rape/sexual harassment can be an incredibly painful thing to go through and pretty much requires you to go through it right then, when you at your most vulnerable, not months later when you feel a little more stable. Reporting it requires you to essentially commit to continue engaging with the fact you were raped for weeks or months, when a lot of victims aren capable of doing that.

There a huge debate over that exact question. It hard to say, in my honest opinion. Much of it goes back to faith. Many religions feel a grave is the way their deity would see them fit, for some it a way of coping. On the historical end, it a non direct way of physically preserving history. So many reasons to keep a cemetery, so many reasons to dispose of them. Fortunately in my case, it in a spot where there little to no land value if someone wanted to develop on it, but I understand in other cases why it can be an issue.

Yes, using a dead legends account is disgusting, yes, especially for advertisement, but Captain Marvel was not a shitty movie by any means, Brie Larsons statements about her intebtions with were just unnecessary and misguided. You see, strong female roles shouldn be more special than strong male roles for precisely the same reasons that she thinks they should be more special, because if you make them "special" and "empowering", there gonna be a lot of bigots, sexists reeling about with foam on their proverbial mouths in disgust, and sheeple who like to pump the hate brakes because everyone else seems to do it will join them in the toxic backlash, and if you instead don mention it, and just say that she feels honoured to play such a powerful and awesome character, you normalize it and nobody gives two craps about anyone gender anymore, and in the end it makes strong female empowerment feel much more attainable to the young women she wants to help than when you make it all special and privileged to be allowed to play a lead role as a woman, resulting in the ugly part of the internet rearing its insultingly hateful head making these women only more insecure and unwilling to ever be the openly strong and self supporting "badass bitches" (in the words of broad city) they want to be, because of the shit they get from neckbeards on the internet.

The thing is that everybody here is saying that Westerners don care about the genocide and that Turks don get offended if they do. But this is a case of yet another European country recognising it and yet another case of backlash from this community when it was never about them in the first place. It seems like everybody here is just disproving their own points? This thread didn need to be made, and yet here it is. It a self fulfilling prophecy.

Format: To start the workout, Busch had me lie down on a massage table with a stretching board placed on top. Then, he strapped me in. Foreboding, right? The reason for being strapped in is that it stabilizes the body. The straps were placed over my hips and whichever leg Busch wasn't working with. it kept my hips and relaxed leg from raising up and impeding whatever stretch we were working on). Then Busch got to work. We stretched out each leg (quad, calf, hamstring, hips, hip flexors) and then stretched out my rotator cuff and pecs. Then I moved onto some padding on the floor so Busch could mash me. Using his feet and knees, Busch used principals of Thai massage and foot shiatsu to knead my legs, pecs, and shoulders.

A bar fridge in the island makes it easy to access drinks without going into the main work area. Plenty of storage is provided by 24 inch deep drawers on the kitchen facing side and 12 inch deep cabinets with touch open and close on the opposite side.
