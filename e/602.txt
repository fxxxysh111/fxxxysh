I've noticed, in the last few months, a new disclaimer added to the old disclaimer at end of commercials for the lottery. The old disclaimer says for entertainment purposes only.

Does that happen, and if it does, how would it work?

If you are going to play in the online casino for a long time and rather insistently, this casino bonus will help you, it can really be considered free money. If you play casino slots with 95% pay outs, a bonus will allow you to make on average extra 2000$ of stakes ($100/(1 0,95)=$2000), after that the amount of bonus will be over. But there can be complications, for example, if you simply want to have a look at a casino, without playing for a long time, if you prefer roulette or other casino games, forbidden by casinos' rules for winning back bonuses. In the majority of online casinos you won't be allowed to withdraw money or will simply return a deposit, if a wager is not made on the games allowed in the online casino. If you are keen on roulette or blackjack, and a bonus can be won back only by playing slots, make the required $3000 of stakes, in the course of 95% of pay outs you will lose on average $3000(1 0,95)=$150. As you see, you not only lose the casino bonus but also take out of your pocket $50, in this case it is better to refuse the bonus. Anyway, if blackjack and poker are allowed for winning back the bonus with a casino's profit only about 0,5%, so it can be expected that after winning back the bonus you will have $100 30000,005=$85 of the casino's money.

The resolution is destined to pass the House, where the Democrats hold a majority, and probably will clear the GOP controlled Senate in coming weeks. But it's unlikely to get enough support in either chamber to override a promised veto by Trump.With the votes, both parties will be staking out ground on what's likely to be one of the more divisive issues in the 2020 election, while also highlighting a power struggle that's been brewing for years between Congress and the White House over how much control a gridlocked legislature should cede to the executive branch.It also sets the tone for the next two years of divided government, putting congressional Republicans in the uncomfortable position of opposing their president or defending unilateral White House action they sharply criticized in the Obama administration.Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Tuesday she will support the resolution, putting the Democrats within one GOP vote of the number needed to pass the resolution in that chamber if all Democrats and independents vote yes.Murkowski said that with the emergency declaration, Trump "is overstepping into the legislative prerogative.

Typically, novices will start out playing for free and very many people do this. Once my confidence was up, and I knew what I knew and what I didn't know, I invested $20 in a bankroll and played high rolling 1c/2c games. You can play for hours and sometimes finish up a little bit up or a little bit down, all the while having risked little more than $5. Limits make sure things don't get out of hand. The low stakes keep the sharks away. I never once thought of it as gambling, it's a game with a slight bonus financial element.

Suicide is never the result of one factor (bullying, divorce, etc)   it is a mix of several different factors usually combined with inadequate coping skills.

As the judge observed, the wording in the act is but it is also very wide in its scope as to what constitutes income. In other words, it casts a very wide net and specifically includes gratuities received by a taxpayer. the taxpayer arguments that the tips should be tax exempt because they were gambling proceeds, the judge distinguished between the money won in the hands of the gambler and the money turned over to the attendant. A jackpot winner doesn have to pay tax on any winnings, but when part of these winnings are then paid to a casino employee in recognition of the services that the patron received, nature of that amount changes from being non taxable to a taxable amount in the hands of the employee. judge analogized the situation to a casino patron tipping a server in a restaurant using proceeds of his jackpot win. Clearly, the server tip would be taxable income to the restaurant employee and not deemed to be tax free gambling proceeds.

CR: Because this viewpoint isn't established among the medical community yet, they may overlook effective approaches concerning fascia.

I ended up having to sit out OTF and CG because of it, and I love OTF so much that it made me really sad.

Now, if one were to multiply 375g by the 7.53billion people on this planet, one would get 2.82 trillion grams of soy per day (and that modestly rounding down to the nearest hundredth of a trillion). That 2.82 billion kg per day, or 6.22billion lbs per day. Multiply that by 365 days and you get a little over one trillion kg per year or 1.01 billion tons. Comparatively, the world currently only produces 352 million tons of soy per year. Divide 1.01 billion tons by 352 million tons, and you will see that the current production of soy would have to increase nearly three fold to sustain the necessary protein intake of every human on the planet (2.7, to be exact). So no, veganism would make the industrial farming of soy and its devastating effects on the environment much, much worse.

Not like magic. But it can significantly improve your quality of life to a point where you not hurting all the time.

In your shoes I would check the river still because despite counting the cards (whether as a level or an actual tell) he could still have a flush. In fact, since he does something like that it now makes it more likely (although still pretty damn improbable) that he could have turned the higher straight, because if he dumb or desperate enough to count out loud (even if it as a trick), it means he not good enough to control his physical actions during a hand and/or he doesn trust his strategy enough to play like a statue so he relies on mindgames.To be clear the field is definitely mega soft in those tournaments.

What does any of that have to do with your lying about illegal immigrants being violent American killing criminals? I thought we were still discussing the fact that immigrants aren nearly as dangerous as you make them out to be? Should we discuss you neglecting the fact that undocumented immigrants do pay federal taxes and the fact that the presence of undocumented immigrants hurts minimum wage but causes a net improvement to the economy? If you going to treat every illegal immigrant like a criminal when US citizens are more likely to commit crime than them, why wouldn you treat citizens the same way when they more likely to be criminals?

I'm not sure if you meant that to rebut what I said somehow, but it didn't really address it. I'm talking about potential right leaning allies that are against racism and white identity politics. If they see it as a choice between a two groups that are both playing identity politics then they are going to hold their nose and go with the side that doesn't see white men as the enemy and will at least cut their taxes. Identity politics on the left is also far more mainstream than you seem to be saying. That's a huge problem with the movement to use government to help people.

After I got dressed and went to pay, we both just acted like nothing happened. He acknowledged that he may have gone a bit far this time but that when he "finds a spot of tension, he massages it." He mentioned that next time I come in, he focus on my butt/glutes. To me all of this feels like the massage turned inappropriate, but since you guys are actual massage therapists, I want to make sure there nothing I missing as far as what is/isn appropriate and massage techniques. In case it is relevant, he an immigrant and I don know if massage standards might be different in different cultures, but he went to massage school here in the United States. I really regret not saying "no" to anything and just going along with everything, making him think I was okay with all of that, but as I said I was panicking and froze up. What do you guys make of all this? (And thanks for reading!)

I actually take care of lots of patients actively trying to quit. There are few things in the world harder to do, even when they actively motivated to quit. I give them patches, gum, I start them on naltrexone, get them plugged into resources, they still relapse sometimes. It happens. Naltrexone takes someone chances of quitting drinking from like 10% to 20%, and it considered a phenomenal drug (an NNT of 10 is huge).

This is why I have a hard time reading Alexander Hamilton's writing compared to that of his contemporaries. He doesn't just use big words, he constructs sentences in such a flowery, round about way that I can understand why people thought he came from another planet. 
Also, how experienced are the physicians if they treat so few patients for each pathology?Not a student. But I not in the US. Here (Italy) I never heard of centers with less than 2 accelerators. Not in my region anyway. Especially because, even for private centers that are not subject to central planning, the healthcare system strongly discourages the installation of advanced techniques in centers where they would not meet a certain number of treatments a year, they favour having few centers with lots of patients (and machines) for "second level" treatments. I know of few hospitals with less than 3 accelerators actually. Not only for radiation therapy, even for interventional cardiology there a rule regarding the minimum number of patients that you can treat in a year. With exceptions only for rural areas.
The rise of nazism and their views on "degeneracy" and "preserving the race" and all that bullshit so quickly took root and within a decade Germany had gone from a (for the time) bit of a gay haven to active genocide.

My neighborhood allows duplexes but almost nobody builds them because the rent on each part of the duplex is almost the cost of the average mortgage in this area. With FHA loans if you can scrape up 1% down you better off just buying the place instead of paying someone else mortgage.

Because of this, the machine was also termed as one armed bandits.

I wouldn recommend calling people "fucking idiots" when your analogy is totally flawed. Because correct betting strategy in blackjack is well known, there no personal agency involved, assuming all players are playing perfectly which is what the casino should assume to maintain its 51% margin. (In practice, the house margin would be higher, because some players wouldn know what to do.)

I mean, in TF2 (I talking team fortress, not Titanfall) the Heavy has a hitbox probably 3x the size of the Scout but it completely balanced since his DPS is higher by the same factor.

Conceiving her took four years of fertility treatments pills and vials, needles in my arms, needles in my stomach, needles in my butt, surgeries and so many wands and gloves shoved into my nether regions that it stopped seeming strange. After three failed in vitro fertilizations, it took an egg donor, too. The donor was a friend of mine. A better friend, it turned out, than I even knew. We worked out the details over pomegranate margaritas, and when the test came back positive, she was the first person I called.

In none of the institutions you linked, historians never went over the arguments and views used by Turkish side to do a comparative analysis to at least show why they should be seen as a wrong way of looking at the events and address the most common concern of Turkish people that the genocide is recognized purely for political reasons.

A colleague and I devised a neutropenic sepsis pathway for oncology patients in the emergency department, including an alert label for blood tests. We were supported by the lead for acute oncology.

I've never shot up, but there was a point in my life that I'd smoke or drink or eat anything. One of the many things I learned from that is drugs will flow. No matter what you do, an addict will get their fix. It's an undeniable force of nature. So when I see stuff like these lights, it makes me laugh. But it also makes me a little angry. It just adds one more layer of "fuck you" from society, further pushing them down the hole of addiction. Just one more reminder that we don't want your "kind" around here. I know crime follows drug use and poverty, but a fucking light bulb in a gas station bathroom or providing clean needles and a safe way to dispose of them is not going to change that. The intervention needs to be heavier and more intense at that point. You will never find an addict that woke up one day and decided to be one or dreamed of being one as a kid. Something bad happened to set them on that path. I'd really like to see more compassionate attitudes towards users and addicts rather than the "fuck you junkie" mentality that runs rampant. Addicts are addicts and they can't be shunned or punished into recovery.
