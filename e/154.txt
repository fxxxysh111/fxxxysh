I was a teenager, about 16. Two friends and I (3 guys) went to our friend (girl) house. She was kind of known to be loose but none of us were on that. We were just kickin it because she was actually pretty cool when you got to know her. We all watching tv and this older guy relative walks in with a brief case but he aint a business man. He was wearing a tall black tshirt with Tony the tiger blinged out on it and baggy ass jeans with a fitted hat. He maybe 25 or so. He goes who tf are you guys? Shocked af no one answers. I know it looked bad because we were all alone with her but we were fully clothed and in the living area. After like 10 secs of silence he gets irritated and goes away. Bro comes back in a few secs with a fucking strap. It looked like a glock. He asked us again who we were. Both of my friends immediately jammed up. I look over at the girl and shes frozen too. You know its bad when the person close to them is just sitting there shocked too. The guy immediately calmed down and left the room. We got tf up got our shit and started leaving. Naaaaah we good to go bro.

[Kim says this sort proudly and smugly, like he thinks it a huge hand. He got it all in here against 3 opponents, not just for meaningless chips but for something actually tangible, and he had the fourth best hand at the table. Not only that, but he tabled his two pair like it was the nuts. Even more so in a game like 5 card draw where your opponents can see ANY of your cards, and the only direct info they have about your hand is how many cards you traded in (which, again, can be totally deceptive).

In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all expense paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance.

When it comes to individualized learning paths, the evidence shows that both gifted students and highly motivated students do really well when they are able to learn at their own pace and have some autonomy over their learning, but unmotivated students (who comprise a significant portion of all high school students) do much worse, as it is essentially removing the extrinsic motivators (like social pressure, group work, clear expectations) which at least had them doing the bare minimum.The takeaway here is that education is really, really complicated, and every time you solve one problem you create another.

There hasn been any significant reflection on how the electoral college works or why it even necessary for the entire countries history. If America wasn satisfied with it system they would have done something about it,just like America would have elected a different candidate if Trump didn represent us properly.

The idea here is that you still have quite a bit of creativity choice in the palm of your hands, with very limited secondary objectives.

Having one of these programs is extremely helpful for playing online poker. If you're playing a sensical number of tables (say, up to 4 or 6), this is probably all you'll need. If you play a ton of tables, you might want a little more help. TableNinja is a commercial program that will help you massively multi table, doing things like auto filling in your preferred bet sizes, auto bringing your mouse to the table that needs action next, auto registering you for sit n gos, and lots more. I sometimes use a simpler (and free) AutoHotKey script, called StarsPlanner, which I use just to automatically place my mouse near the buttons of the next table needing action; I find that helpful for reducing RSI inducing motion even when I'm only playing a few tables.

Centaurs would probably have breasts on the human torso part, and also have horse mammaries on the horse torso part. Things get complicated from here, since centaur babies might use either pair, depending on whether they like human babies, and fairly larval when born, or like horse babies, and pretty fully developed. I guessing the latter since in humans the head is the limiting factor, while in centaurs their heads are smaller than horse heads. This means they probably suckle from the horse nipples and the upper human pair might be more vestigial.

There also the way the animation itself is done. A casual hand motion in 3D is done by simply taking the model you already made and posing it in the right way. With 2D you have to draw the motion frame by frame, meaning you can exaggerate the motion, making it more stylized, etc. I think the difference often relies in these "little details".

The big stacks of chips represent big money, but money itself, an onlooker begins to understand, is almost without psychological weight to the top players. Eric Drache, who runs the cardroom at the fancy new Mirage casino here, was offered a job once when he was a full time card player. He had to ask a civilian friend whether $150,000 was a good year's salary. It didn't sound like much to a man who was usually up or down more than that after an evening's play. Unofficial side games here routinely slosh with more money than the World Series itself. Hundred dollar bills are banded in sheaves of 50; and sheaves are wadded in stacks of ten; and bets and raises hit the table hard, thud thud thud.

Most importantly, Luna was super magical. Unlike most of the folks in the wizarding world who to an extent took magic for granted and had ideas about what was possible and what wasnt based on what was common place.

Now, for many of us, we expect nothing but betrayalOf course, like any dysfunctional relationship, there were clues immediately that we should start hardening ourselves to the fantasy that we would finally have an administration that was ours and ours alone, rather than a President that is always sneaking off to cavort with big military and big banks. Then came Larry Summers and the TARP bailouts and the increase of troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan and so many betrayals that by now, my heart is like stone and there is nothing left for the Obama ites to do that will hurt meOr so I say. 
Poker proponents argue that it will be harder for opponents to suggest that Pokerstars is a "bad actor" which should be banned from California if the company is accepted as an acceptable business in another state.While these recent developments offer the first significant hope for poker players in California in quite some time, it remains to be seen whether the competing interests will be able to come together for a compromise any time soon..

It is not the Lefts job to deradicalize, they just need to honestly disagree and not lean into hyperbolic dehumanizing practices. Calling a MAGA hat a modern day KKK hood, or all Republicans Nazis, will not change their minds. Blocking conservatives from speaking on college campuses, and calling ideas that were mainstream just 10 years ago hate speech are not ways that can create a United country.

After I say that I work for a small finance company, he quietly says, "Oh so your an investor too" and then immediately pretends like he didn't say that. I told him what I'm doing, trying to help people out by financing to worthy people, etc etc. Helping people sell there homes quickly etc etc. He tries to convince me it is his home, etc. I keep talking to him, picking his brain, and I already told him my price range. He says, you won't ever find a deal for that cheap unless your really lucky. I told him about me financing for people and he says that for the home I'm calling about, he would finance for 10k down, because that is what he has in the home.

Even in some situations where you have a preflop range advantage and board range interaction advantage, you should bet big because draws in PLO have more equity and your betting range benefits from building the pot as much as possible (since you cant overbet later in hands).
CCC was published in the past 2 4 years. It has a modern layout/design and updated vocabulary and workbooks. IIRC, it has two essays per chapter whereas PAVC has one.

It mattered a lot that Magritte was Belgian, not French. The French Surrealists made a point of public provocation, inserting themselves into politics, issuing pretentious manifestos. His early work, in the 1920s, was mainly exercises in late Cubism   the "tubist," streamlined, geometrical forms of Fernand Leger and Amedee Ozenfant, shapes that might have been made from metal.

Now it is our turn, the border crossers, to engage in the ritualized behavior of nation state boundary maintainence. We act docile, hand over documents, lie about the sesame balls we have in the backseat because they are both contraband and because we cannot imagine that such delicious treats can present a threat to the security of the country (although perhaps this is a failure of imagination on our part since clearly sesame balls must be dangerous to the territorial integrity of the United States or why else would we all be engaging in this ritual of border creation in the first place?).

My point about apartheid, however, is that I argue that a pretty key component of whether or not something is apartheid is whether or not the marginalized group wants to be a member of the dominant country to begin with. In 1948, the Palestinians rejected the Partition Plan. 2006 aside, Palestinians have sought independence, and have generally called for their own homeland, whether the desire is for all of Israel to be Palestinian, as was the call in 48 or for different geographical parameters, which is typically the call today, resulting in some form of a two state solution. This is a pretty big difference from many other marginalized groups   even Turkish Kurds have begun calling for integration into Turkish society. Few Palestinians want to become Israelis, which I understand, but it does lead to a gray area with regards to citizenship and voting rights.

Hats also caused a majority of the player base to turn on each other, they purposely built it up as this big elusive venture that you couldn even elect to opt into because it was based on a very very small random percent, this was made 100% worse when Valve proceeded to punish people for idling not just by taking their hats, but by then rewarding everyone else for pretty much doing nothing. 
The problem with worshipping a formless, featureless god is that it leads to a path of frustration and tribulations are plenty. It is easier to worship a god with forms.

My personal opinion is that maps are potentially an 'easy' way to 'police'. Map has to be delivered to Register Technical at start of year and if / when changed at any time and if you are later found found using a different map to that registered (or may be to those registered) then it's bye bye. There is not really a reason why ECUs even in Proto could not be collected and retained once map approved. if you want to do something else with your car somewhere else you have to get ano ECU but you can only use the Championship one that is handed back to you at each event.

Because we are larger hospital, and we do have slightly expanded MRI and EEG capabilities, our administrators have made it clear that we are not to push back against transfers unless there is absolutely nothing else that we can do for these patients. Unfortunately, if they haven't already gotten an MRI for work up, this is a service that we can perform in a timelier fashion than the community hospital. We often accept patients for continuous EEG monitoring for the same reason, even though they are stable and not seizing.

So many people are being harmed by drugs prescribed by doctors, many who prescribe drugs in exchange for freebies from the pharmaceutical companies. People are being refused treatment by their insurance companies.

Next, you need to administer an ear miticide. Products that contain pyrethrins, a natural insecticide, are available at pet supply stores.

A single cleaning and treatment with ear drops won't do the trick, because just one surviving female mite with eggs will begin the entire ordeal anew. You must clean out your cat's ears every day and use the miticide exactly as directed (which may take a few weeks depending on the product).

The Tzar Bomba was so impractically big that creating a parachute to slow its descent disrupted the Soviet textile industry. If you're wondering why they needed a parachute in the first place, it's because no matter how high you dropped it from, the resulting explosion would reach up into the sky and disintegrate your plane unless you gave yourself some kind of head start. In fact, the bomb was originally supposed to be twice as big as it ended up being, but they realized that it would be impossible to drop such a bomb from an airplane without killing everyone aboard. Also, it probably would have cracked the earth like an egg. Who the hell knows?
What might establish the peripheries of this question are books that keep intact a belief system, or way of life, a secret or not codification of a state of well being? A Bible? Alcoholics Anonymous? Probably that is the first place to visit, the religious book, though offhand it seems that the travel of this sort of book wouldn transcend one owner. The Bible and company are enormously popular books and have been printed no doubt in terms of billions of copies, so they have a much better chance of being the leader of the category by sheer numerical possibility.

At this point, if you lose all your chips, you are out of the tournament for good. It's typical for re buys and add ons to be available for the first hour of play.

Chingletrone is absolutely right. I would like to add using different colors of pens to separate out main ideas on each page of notes.

The expectation from a novel experience was sending judders of delight and fright into my brain. I was asked by the dealer to point something out, I did. I won few red and pink coloured coins.

However, the most commonly played poker games for the first three variants are the five card draw, seven card stud, and the Texas hold 'em.
Another scenario is the person with a large RRSP who is in their late 50s or early 60s. A lot of thought might go into the idea of drawing down the RRSP meaningfully over the next 10 years, and delaying taking CPP and OAS until age 70. If they do this effectively, they may be able to receive full OAS instead of getting clawed back, and in addition, they will have a smaller RRIF balance when they die and will face less tax at the end..

Alas, this economy is notoriously uncompetitive because tax rates are too high, regulation is too heavy, and executives are too complacent. It thrives only in good times, as it lacks the mojo to push through heavy weather.

You better ask her if she has cheated on someone in the past, because it sounds like she has.

Artists are entitled to rewards for their music but not to specific rewards. If an artist makes popular music their entitled to praise from their audience in terms of having them as their audience. If a music label wants to sell their music then the musician is entitled to money from their label and a percentage of those sales but they are not entitled to make a sale, just to a percentage of sales that get made. If musicians choose to commoditize their performances in exchange for money then they are entitled to that. But if I have two albums ive recorded (which i do) but i dont choose to put them up on youtube for free (i dont) and no one is offering me any deals to release my music then Im entitled to nothing. If I willingly give a copy of those albums to a friend and that person makes copies and shares them with other people Im not entitled to money from anyone.

Another problem that many inexperienced Omaha/8 players have is continuing to play after the flop when they have a chance to win only half the pot and it is likely they will have to split their half (thus, being quartered). An example of this is when you hold A 2 9 T, the flop is 3 6 K, and there are three or more players in the pot betting and raising. You have almost no chance at a high hand, and if you do hit a low, it is likely that another player holds an A and a 2. Even worse, if an A or 2 hits on the turn or river, your low will be counterfeited. Continuing to play in situations like these will cost you more money in the long run than they will make for you.

That being said $1 a pot is acceptable, big pots you may wanna throw up to $5 to the dealer and huge pots use your discretion.

We spend so much time running about and staring into computer screens, that we forget to relax when we are not engaging in these activities. The ideal eye expression is relaxed, yet engaging.
