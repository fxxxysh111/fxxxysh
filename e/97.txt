There is secret cruise code language: It's crucial for the staff to have code words so that passengers don't get freaked out if something goes wrong. A "30 30" means the crew is asking maintenance to clean up a mess; three times during my stint I called in a "PVI" (public vomiting incident). An "Alpha" is a medical emergency, a "Bravo" is a fire, and "Kilo" is a request for all personnel to report to their emergency posts, which happens in the event of, say, a necessary evacuation. Be wary of "Echo," which is called if the ship is starting to drift, or "Oscar," which means someone's gone overboard. A crew member told me he's had only four or five "Oscars" in 10 years of cruising.

Now, I do want to be extremely clear that I am talking about ethical power dynamics and absolutely did not state that this situation "is equivalent to raping a child" or anything like that. Most universities actually have strict conduct policies about instructors having sex with their students. While it's true adults are less vulnerable than children (I'm aware 18 is adulthood, thanks!), that doesn't make anything done to them completely acceptable. I don't want anyone to think that if a professor or boss comes to them and says "hey, your grade is slipping/your job is in danger, but you can make it up to me" through sex that a) that's in anyway acceptable for someone with power over them to do and b) that they have no options to get that abuse of power to stop. They do.

It actually not unreasonable to claim a dose that low would have some sort of an effect, maybe not with LSD but certainly with other drugs that act on HT2a. Look at Charles Nichols (yup, David Nichols son) studies on the anti inflammatory effects of DOI in vivo. They have demonstrated potent anti TNF effects in rats at far below the cognitive/CNS effects that recreational users associate with the drugs. There are ongoing studies to test as an athesma treatment in humans and patents filed. Also look at the FDA approved drug lorcaserin, which is a psychedelic acting on the HT2c receptors, the ones in question for causing heart problems. As long as the patients take the medicinally active amount far below threashold CNS effects, there nothing "psychedelic" about it unless you "OD" in which case you have an uncomfortable trip.

After Jackson death, a Rolling Stone story declared of his body: prosthesis he normally attached to his damaged nose was missing, revealing bits of cartilage surrounding a small, dark hole. An Allure analysis of his facial surgery over the years recalled that by 2002, people think Jackson nose is falling off, or that he is wearing a prosthetic. The raggedness at the tip is actually paper tape, used by plastic surgeons to control swelling autopsy did show that he tattooed his lips pink, his scalp black (possibly to make his hairline more seamless when connected to his wigs) and his eyebrows darker. But a Los Angeles County coroner, Ed Winter, said the nose rumors were false.

For the NL variants, I would expect one to beat the lower stakes by modeling the market and the higher stakes by modeling individual players. As there are sites logging each hand played on the major sites, it would be interesting to see whether it would be possible to beat players by making their simulacra from that data and train bots by pitting them against those simulacra.2) It has intriguing property that like Go and Chess, it is easy to dispense with the real time constraint and in lieu of modeling human players, create synthetic experience.

So the first thing I say you do is recognize this and know that you may feel this way. Once you do that it would be easier to sift through the great advice you're getting here and follow something that makes sense to you.

Suppose you have N players, and these players are exchanging transactions between them (more on what the transactions are will be explained in a later post). An interesting aspect of the consensus group is that individual players don't have an impact on the outcome of the protocol, so the consensus group can be formed completely at random. A subset of size greater than T can reveal the secret while smaller subsets of size less than T learn nothing about the secret. Once all the sub protocol rounds have completed and a result has been generated, the Honey Badger BFT protocol moves to the next round. The result is just a value or the outcome that all the players in the consensus group S have agreed upon.

Ok. So I a 30 y/o professional male who is friends with one of my co workers. I a gassy fellow so I usually have a good fart of two saved for my smoke breaks. My co worker thinks my farting is hilarious (as do I) so it an ongoing joke for us. One day we went to lunch together and I drove. When we got back to the building after lunch I was just going to drop her off and go home because I had the afternoon off. Just at the moment I arrived at our office I felt a huge fart coming so I rolled up the windows and drove really slowly around the parking lot so I could fart in the car and not let her out; all while laughing maniacally. Unfortunately, it wasn a fart and I crapped myself. a lot. Funniest damn thing either of us has experienced in a long time. Damn lucky I had the afternoon off to go home and change/shower.

What I keep finding interesting is the lesbian, gay, and bi short people can blame the opposite gender because we date our own gender. It almost a different playing field. When you short, you have some challenges like gender normas, culture, social structures, but when your gay you can blame the opposite sex, you can blame social conventions because you already out if the norm there, and most cultures barely have traditions for gay people so you don have to worry about that either.

The two minute ad from Procter Gamble's razor brand shows men and boys engaging in bullying and sexual harassment and encourages men to "say the right thing" and "act the right way."

My best piece of advice is to follow the miles in the plan. Run the days you don feel like running and if for some reason you miss a day or can complete all the miles for that day, add it to a different day during the week.

But you known when your just sore, or when it may be a bigger issue. You will know when you need energy or water and what overall will work for you. Good luck!

We have a raising range and calling range and a folding range. 
The thing to watch is that in the fall, IEX will become a full fledged stock exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange. They can then wage full war with the system, in a way they cant now. Right now they're still fighting with a hand tied behind their back and I think I would not be shocked to see a lot of movement once that happens. And I see it happening from two groups of people: one is CEOs of publicly listed companies who are outraged by how their shares are traded on the exchanges, and second is big mutual funds and pension funds investors who have the trust of small investors. There are a lot of large ones who are calculating what they're saving by trading on IEX as opposed to letting their orders go to the open market. If those numbers are big enough, I think that's going to force change.

A similar situation just happened to me, also with the first non family cat I had all to myself. My cat had lots of health problems, and I thought I was prepared for when his time came. I was not. It was devastating when his health took a sharp turn. I just take comfort in knowing that he had such a full and happy life while he was still feeling healthy, and that I didn let him suffer for very long. It such a hard experience to go through, I so sorry you have to go through it too, and I wish you the very best.

Keep in mind we only had 40 people here and 27 that actually enter the game. This is excluding everyone that wasn't old enough to play anyways.

Birthright Citizenship I am AGAINST ending birth right citizenship, HOWEVER, I understand how some so called nativists can feel frustrated about the whole thing because quite frankly the other side wants to do nothing. All you hear is talk about "dignity" and "hugs" and other non sense that is not really solution oriented. You have a guy from the border running for Senate talking about how Texas should lead on the immigration debate, but that is where his conversation starts and ends on the topic. And no, families should not be separated, but don tell me the tents are bad. It has been a few years since I was last in Guatemala, but parts of rural Guatemala and the shantytowns built into the hillside outside of Guatemala City might have you reconsider how "inhumane" tents with HVAC really are. I am generally opposed to intervening in other countries, but some countries may need some "guidance" or "assistance" if you will. Certainly you must tread careful because then we are back to nationalism.

Am I crazy to even consider letting my husband go 2 hours away this late in the pregnancy? I do have a local friend who is around on Saturday so if the girls are out there with him, she could bring me to the hospital until he can get back. I feel like I should let him go and have fun, but I still am pretty concerned when I think that he could possibly miss the birth if things happened fast, which is always a possibly with the third child. Anybody have any thoughts? I am so torn!

The Hordaland Health study in Western Norway illustrated an inverse association between standardized energy adjusted magnesium intake and depression scores, meaning that people who consumed less magnesium had higher rates of depression (13). Suicidality, one of the primary manifestations of severe depression, is accompanied by low cerebrospinal fluid levels of magnesium despite normal calcium levels, lending credence to the role of magnesium in positive emotionality (15).

It's presumptive evidence of valid service (meaning it's now on the defendant to prove that they didn't receive it, which is hard). But service issues rarely result in anything as drastic as a dismissal, because a lot of the time you end up coming to court when they try to enforce the judgment and if you can prove they should vacate the default judgment (which usually requires you to show that you have a winning defense on the merits of the underlying lawsuit) then they just serve you then and the whole thing starts over..

Wendy deals with constant aggression, from being intentionally mis gendered all the way to sexual assault, the threat of which is always present. physical part of her womanhood had been allowed to be solely her own, Plett writes of Wendy; people treat her body a casualness they would only treat their own. It led her to a disposition that initially seems prickly she given to fits of anger (especially when drunk) but through empathetic characterization, this is shown to be a defence mechanism of a sensitive and kind woman. By the mid point of the book, readers wonder how Wendy restrains herself from getting into constant fistfights with those who offer up unsolicited opinions of her.

If you making rolling targets, you could make 2 rolling structures, just cut the plywood in half and do 5ftx4ft or 5x4.5 and hang 2 targets. 4 ft is more than enough space to hang one target. And if you have two structures, you could set them at different distances so you don need to move them around as much. You take up just as much space with the target like you originally intended, but you have more versatility with them. Of course you need a second target for that.
This supports that some will suffer injury at low impact speeds.(8) The risk of facet capsular ligament injury is more related to individual differences than to the magnitude of the loads to which an individual is exposed.To compare the maximum principal strain in the facet capsular ligament under combined shear, bending, and compressive loads with those required to injure the ligament.The cervical facet capsular ligament is thought to be an anatomic site for whiplash injury, although the mechanism of its injury remains unclear.Motion segments from seven female donors were exposed to quasi static flexibility tests using posterior shear loads of 135 N applied to the superior vertebra under four compressive axial preloads up to 325 N.The right facet joint was then isolated and failed in posterior shear loading.The Lagrangian strain field in the right facet capsular ligament was calculated from capsular displacements determined by stereophotogrammetry.Statistical analyses examined the effect of axial compression on motion segment flexibility, and compared maximum principal capsular strain between the flexibility and failure tests.Capsular strain increased with applied shear load but did not vary with axial compressive load.The maximum principal strain reached during the flexibility tests was 61%  33% of that observed in subcatastrophic failures of the isolated joints.Two specimens reached strains in their flexibility tests that were larger than their corresponding strains at subcatastrophic failure in the failure tests.The cervical facet capsular ligaments may be injured under whiplash like loads of combined shear, bending, and compression..

Nahhhh not how it works, you made a totally wild statement that mattress stores are WELL KNOWN as money laundering fronts. If they so well known and you can provide the evidence, they obviously aren that well known for that. That like me saying "oh well, most car washes are money laundering fronts because Walter White did that in breaking bad." Any Google search you make for "Money laundering mattress store" only comes up with links for the conspiracy.

The temperature at the center of a star is kept high and very nearly constant by an interplay of a number of physical forces. The radiation produced by nuclear reactions in the interior can escape from the star only with great difficulty. It proceeds to the surface not in a straight line but by a complicated, zig zag route, since it is constantly absorbed by atoms and re emitted in new directions. 
That's normal, and not an inaccurate thing for your cooperating teacher to say..

Almost all abortions that are done in the second trimester (months 4 6) are done for medical reasons. If a fetus heart stops beating, a woman can either deliver a still birth, or she can go through an abortion procedure. I assuming most women would choose an abortion over going through the pain of delivering a stillborn.

This is probably a good time to mention that I am the general counsel of our company. HR didn report to me (it does now) and the TPA didn have to answer to me (it does now). Long story short, with the CEO blessing, I rolled HR under my umbrella, fired the head of HR (longer story there this was the just tip of the iceberg of a host of issues that I discovered when I started really focusing on the HR function, but I digress) and now the TPA is frantically working to amend the plan to add after tax, non roth contributions and in service distributions. As soon as they finish that task, I will fire them too.

Bitonality, or implying two keys at once, ESPECIALLY substituted keys, fills in the rest of the blanks. Let look at the last chord of bar 8, on the syllable " tion" of "imagination". Normally, the melody would end us on a Bb dominant chord to prep EbM or Cm. Here we see all the tricks at once. We chord planed in that 1 5 10 in the bass down to an E major, which is the tritone substitution of the Bb we expect. Meanwhile, we prepping the Cm7 of the next bar by tritone subbing an FM dyad played at the same time as the E chord in the root.

Meanwhile paid players build up personal   not team   reputations often assisted by good local players in there for the love of the game. Too many players have become "large fee" coaches with little, if any, qualification to act in the latter capacity.

Languages which do the thing where 3rd person pronouns are either demonstrative or quite transparently related to/derived from demonstratives, as well as languages which use common nouns in 3rd person meanings (which is attested, for example in some Chimbu languages (TNG; PNG), such as Golin and Salt Yui) are on occasion called "two person languages" as they distinguish only two "true" persons in their pronominal system.

The heavyweight division here in the UK has at least some fighters that divide opinions as wide as Wilder when the richest prize in sport is discussed.

Most (don kill me) jobs on the market these days deal with AWS, yes, there are some Google/Azure but knowing AWS and knowing how things work and what services you deal with is a HUGE plus.

Look here, you can see the bucket that the desperate prisoner would be allowed to both shit into, and eat out of; with permission from the screws, of course.

One time, my wife really wanted her mom and sisters to come visit. Her mom wouldn't come unless we put new tires on her car and paid for the gas because she didn't have the money.

After the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, I shut it down for a few weeks to give myself a bit of recovery, only running to help maintain my base (and because I like running way too much to completely stop it's impossible for me)!

I focused more on speed while building back to a peak week of 145km.

When the founders of Mattel, the Handlers, traveled to Germany in 1950 they found a naughty little doll by the name of Lili. Lord, was based on a pornographic cartoon and sold to adult men as a pocket sized novelty (one must assume for masturbatory purposes). And the Handlers thought, "Gee, wouldn this little masturbatory aid make a great toy for girls? And let name it after our daughter, Barbara." It is Barbie dodgy beginnings that give early Barbie a kinda hard and tough look, like a sex worker. In fact, it wasn until 1971, sixteen years after the introduction of Barbie/Lili that Mattel reshaped Barbie into the blank expression, Playboy Playmate type face that she still sports today.

Top pair+: 17% of the time (Not all good top pair mind you def KAs K2s + KAo K8or7o)Played against a guy like this at the Horseshoe. He was a regular and would continually buy in for $100. He would open with $25 every single hand. Once the flop came he would shove. I had a stack of around $600 and called him and he shows Q,3 to my A,K. Flop was Q,3,A turn and river were junk. I realized then that some players just don care. He is there to gamble, not play poker if that makes sense. He built his stack to around $250 thanks to my call and another players call/fold. Then his play turned comical. Preflop raises of $30 50. He got caught a few times with junk and lost and his stack went down to $20 and he pulled up and walked out.
