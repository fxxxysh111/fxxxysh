I've honestly just started telling them I don't need vitals. I'm not sure why they always give them when they know I can just look at them in the computer (and am currently doing so) and then they read the doctors H to me straight off the screen. I get that they're covering their asses, but it legitimately feels like I get a report that isn't 100% straight off the MAR once a month (word for word, obviously I don't want them making shit up) and it's like they've never set eyes on the patient in their lives.

In fact I envy these people, which is one of the things that made deciding for sobriety more difficult.

I consider myself a Motown enthusiast, but the label was more about big (or minor, they not that picky) chart toppers than cohesive albums   at least pre Marvin Gaye/Stevie Wonder magic. This album gimmick is to collect a bunch of the aforementioned chart toppers, performed by Motown most precious act, nay sensation of the time. So, these songs are immediately familiar, but selecting the right artists to record these songs (instead of just mindlessly handing them all to that one super successful vocal group) to turn them into the cultural tour de force they were really was Motown big achievement. The auxiliary renditions on "A Go Go" are merely pleasant diversion for both the Supremes and the listener.

Got a husky by accident once  student died, had nobody to take care of 12 week old Sibe. So I took her home, and googled up how to take care of her. (I owned a golden before and thought I knew how to take care of dogs, LOL)  within 5 minutes of the first google search I turned to my wife and said "we have made a terrible mistake." omg, fencing, walking, running, turning her into a sled dog (because she can go to dog parks because she eats little dogs), she also pulls me on a bike and we are learning to do skiing, now  she escapes, she howls, she jumps, she pulls, she is the worst dog. We love her so much and I still can believe how much work she is  I have four kids and my dog demands more personal attention every day than my kids do; and will destroy the house if it is not given. If you do not have about 90 minutes a day for walks, loves, treats, whatever, you do not have enough time for your husky. Had her for four years now, she awesome, but when she dies there will be zero chance I will have the energy for another one. She sits right now, as I type, looking at me  she just picked her head up  I think its time for a walk. Tons of snow, so it will be a good one.

Edit: Oh, and just wanted to add: the comparison to body odor is really really problematic, btw. By comparing things like racism, homophobia, persectution, war, etc. with body odor, you are implying that these things are absolutely normal and cannot be changed. Every nation has it and will always have it and there is nothing to be concerned with with that fact since that absolutely normal   just as every human ever has had body odor. However, I think every member of a any group that has been persecuted ever (to which Poles in WW2 belong too, btw) would like to differ.

No not at all. Those odds leave room for reasonable doubt. Especially with a crime scene that was compromised as badly as this one was. There is reasonable doubt that there were no bones in Avery pit. The "forensic exam" was done at the sheriff office. There are NO crime scene photos and the exuming of the bones should have been recorded. Instead you have a box of bones that could have come from anywhere stored at the sheriff office before being brought to the examiner office and looking at 2 days later. Their was no chain of command. The "evidence" should never have seen the light of a courtroom.

Each of these movements can be done in various positions (supine, tall kneeling, half kneeling, seated, standing, scissor stance) depending on the underlying stability of the individual client.Starting position is dictated by the health professional evaluation of static, dynamic and fundamental stability. The degree of dysfunctional stability (motor control) dictates how challenging the exercise should be in regards to positioning and resistance.Chop and lift patterns for fundamental stability dysfunctions typically begin in an unloaded supine position to lessen demand on the nervous system, thus increasing quality of movement.Static and dynamic stability dysfunctions warrant tall or half kneeling patterns to engage core musculature of the hip.

Skin is especially sensitive because blood vessels dilate, resulting in redness and sensitivity. And as your skin cells shed, they leave your skin with a dull, dry appearance. To combat all these skin care concerns, Jamie pulls from her arsenal of therapeutic massage techniques and essential oils to improve her guests' overall health.

In order to retain power, assuming Margaery would be the one with primary power, she would operate in a way to have people love her, in a very Machiavellian sort of way(basing this off of her interactions with Joffrey and the "if you give them your love, they return it a thousandfold" comment and the scene with the children). Going along with the loyalty thing, white houses wouldn really follow eachother, the common folk might, and I think Margaery would use that to her advantage. The main disadvantage of House Tyrell is that Loras, as a member of the Kingsguard, wouldn marry, Garlan is already married, and I not sure what would happen to Willas.

It a huge disappointment. They went from 31 poker tables to 21 poker tables. The room is more claustrophobic than Bellagio or the main area of Commerce. They severed ties with WPT and won be hosting the Shooting Star in the spring. I don get cell coverage in the room, wifi is piss poor (can load a youtube video).

Two important points to remember: Don't overbet your bankroll, and if a machine is available at which you feel comfortable playing the maximum number of coins, do so. If you are sitting down to play with $20, you don't belong at a $1 machine that will take up to $5 at a time. It is better to play five quarters at a time than one dollar at a time. Though video poker machines pay back a high percentage of the money put into them, the payouts are volatile. It is not unusual to go five or ten or more consecutive hands with no payout. Don't play at a level at which you do not have the funds to ride out a streak.

Records center employees should be capable of analyzing case files to determine how best to maintain client information and legal materials. They should be adept at classifying library holdings and analyzing potential conflicts related to the representation of clients.

I may have been a good player deep down but the rake of NYC private games, the poor play that came about from my tilt, and the addiction aspects that destroyed my sanity and in turn play came about.

It wasn even an "I believe you". I called out the player who folded the Ace, who confirmed and said something to the effect of "sorry about that, I be more careful in the future".

I'm more or less in agreement with your conclusions here. As far as demographic shifts are concerned, I think the statistics you cited wrt second amendment sentiment is a symptom of the highly autocorrelated nature of political opinions, and thus their surveys. To me, the solution is to work with those who I may agree with on other issues to improve education and critical thinking regarding the second amendment. The ballot box is too late to do that   you're already voting on too aggregate a platform to send an effective message about one issue. So instead, I do what I'm doing here. I visibly demonstrate the degree to which liberalism is compatible with supporting the second amendment. "I think undocumented immigrants should be able to own guns" is a hell of a thought starter.
