If you drawing a blank, then understanding the appeal of Zulfiqar Mirza invective should not be too difficult. Stereotyping Sindhi political and social identity with ajraks, vaderas and dacoits in Sindh regularly goes unchallenged in Pakistan. Why should the stereotyping of Mohajirs with the MQM, and the stereotyping of the MQM with bhatta financing, with targeted killings and with urban violence at large be any different? The fact is that it isn Powerful stereotypes are not restricted to Larkana or Nawabshah. Far from the madness of Mirza hate fuelled ethno political theatrics, the twinning of Mohajir identity with the MQM and the twinning of the MQM with violence is a distinct and palpable reality in living rooms right across Punjab.

You don't have to be any good if you're a chef. You could be a really really terrible chef in a shitty restaurant who is good at borrowing money in fact you could be a lot worse of a cook than some random Mom/Dad. Some professional players (particularly new ones) are addicted to gambling in the worst possible way and will eventually go bust.

I admit that this is a very emotional topic, given the fact that black and brown people are still being murdered regularly by the police in this country, as well as enslaved in massive for profit prisons often on ridiculous charges, not to mention the general high level of inherent racism that goes on here every single day.

I agree with others that it is probably best to ignore, or to say a one liner and change the subject (as you tried to do). Something like, "It still the holiday now and we talking now. You didn answer about _______; what does he want for Christmas?" I don know if that is actually good or not, but it probably what I would do if my mom sent a similar message. Usually I try to deflect and move on.
Edit: as another poster mentioned, some of the big organizers (ex: WSOP, WPT, and so on) might track player results for some sort of yearly leaderboard. But again, everyone is eligible for this   they usually just to reward and recognize players who have performed the best over the year, but it not at all about someone being "a poker pro" or "not a pro." Understandably, pros tend to do well on these leaderboards, but that just because they play more events (and so have more chances to accumulate points) than recreational players..

Lane seems out of place here. On a day so grey and cold that one diminutive reporter dons an overcoat, beanie, scarf and gloves, the star of the show turns up in three quarter length pants, bare brown ankles flashing   evidently one of those born and bred beach people who refuse to acknowledge any season but summer.

Sometimes people do unreasonable, unprofitable things simply to show their unreasonableness. Even if our lives turn out bad, its better than the extraction of a square root. In how many western countries is marijuana, something less dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes, legal? Why is it illegal for women to have exposed breasts where men may have exposed chests in most parts of the western world? California almost banned porn without condoms. Australia banned small breasted porn and any involving people whom they felt looked too young, regardless of actual age. The EU made certain forms of hate speech illegal. porn definitely is a scummy, sexist industry that exploits women rn, but there is nothing inherently wrong with sex work if it safe, consensual and regulated. in fact it sexist to tell women they can make porn or participate in sex work   it their body. the implication that porn can only be for men is just as bad

I get attached to all these teachers and therapists and hairdressers who are wonderful and kind but only really there to do their job and then move on. It beyond embarrassing, not to mention painful, to be stuck repeating this pattern of getting attached to a Mom 2.0 whom I still fail to make a genuine connection with and get left behind. It just reinforces my belief that there something inherently bad and unlovable about me. 
Poker is not a free game that you can just play anytime since you need seed money to be able to get a seat at the table and play. What free poker connotates is that you can get to play with the best and the worst of them anytime since this is usually played over on the internet. It becomes "free" because several websites offer poker games to internet poker game players for free. 
I be honest, though: $30 is a pretty good price, considering the cost of materials. Getting non mixed yarn is complicated, and it runs expensive.

Avoid the sticky stuff: Yes, you like to be cool and coiffed with hair gels, mousse and spray, but if you can use a bit less of these salon products, your scalp will thank you. If you can't bear to use less, then use them less often. If there's a day or two a week that you don't have to be runway ready, that's the time. But as relieving as it may feel, scratching is essentially digging your fingernails into sensitive skin. It keeps you cool and it's usually an indication you're working hard to keep your body healthy. But it's also irritating to your scalp. In addition, sweat makes skin cells flake off your body more quickly. When you exercise, don't delay cleaning up. Scan the ingredients. This centuries old remedy is effective at reducing cell turnover. However, there's a reason it's your last and most extreme option. It has a strong smell and it can discolor the shaft of light colored hair. Lemon juice and cream rinse can be helpful in reducing the side effects of this tough dandruff solution.

This makes me wonder about the question of Japanese racism how much of it is linguistic and culturally motivated discrimination/prejudice instead of racially motivated discrimination/prejudice? Then again, in the West we tend not to make a distinction between culturally motivated discrimination and racially motivated discrimination.

One is an extraordinary phone call from the chairman of SNC Lavalin, Kevin Lynch, to the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, on Oct. 15. The phone call was extraordinary in two respects. One, Lynch is a former clerk himself, hired as chairman in 2017, by which time the company assault on Ottawa was well under way. Two, Wernick, by his own account, had to explain to the former clerk that would have to go through the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions through his counsel. there is the letter from the company president, Neil Bruce, to the prime minister, dated the same day, complaining of the company inability to make the prosecutor see things their way. Why, she had even declined to meet with the former Supreme Court judge, Frank Iacobucci, whom the company had retained as counsel, the man Wernick pointedly described to Wilson Raybould as shrinking violet. says a great deal that the company response to being charged with serious crimes was not to fight the charges in court, but to fight them in government: to lobby the politicians, to attempt to intimidate the prosecutors, to arrange calls between old civil service chums. They did so, it is logical to conclude, because they thought it would work because they were given reason to believe it would work.

Those kids need therapy(abusive, addict father who abandoned them, messy parental split, moved around a lot   look up ACE tests, they aren everything but higher scores tend to be a sign of more trauma). Until that can happen they need as many good people around them as they can. The easiest way to explain about talking to some adults and not others is let her know that it isn Grandma Crazy business. The little girl mom knows   that who matters. Mom is the one you don keep secrets from. Grandma may have GPR but that isn the same as being a parent. Suggestion to bio mom for getting kids into therapy is meet evil MIL at their pediatrician office   tell the pediatrician about dad history the 911 call, DR should be on board with therapy, MIL can argue in front of the doctor or she look right crazy, so kids get therapy. Getting therapy is in the best interests of the kids and if she fights it at least it is good fodder to show a judge later on, showing that she doesn have their best interests at heart. So that is sort of win/win.

DNA published a story yesterday that said the prime minister, in his last two years, wants to seize control of the economy from Pranab Mukherjee and secure his own legacy (he perhaps given up on a major breakthrough with Pakistan). Implicit in this is his desire to send Pranab to Rashtrapati Bhawan, a move that Sonia Gandhi is still uncomfortable with; thus the prime minister would have subtly demonstrated his preference in the coming presidential elections. His party chief will find herself with no choice but to nominate Mukherjee. If that happens, then you know that Manmohan Singh played his political cards deftly.

Basses like a little humidity. If your instrument gets too dried out, like in a really cold place where the heater is constantly blasting, or in a frickin desert, it can make the instrument more prone to little cracks or other damage.

By products aren necessarily bad, either, but just make sure there isn an overabundance of them. Cat food is generally the same vein.

We are far from puritanical when it comes to behaviour.As well, according to Cracking the Quebec Code by pollster Jean Marc L one of Quebec distinct traits is that we are non committal, indecisive and averse to strong positions and all I can say to that is uh maybe it true.So it unsurprising most Quebecers think Trudeau and company may have stepped several centimetres over the line in talking to Wilson Raybould, yet also think that a minor political offence, not a hanging one.Similarly, while major columnists in Ontario say Trudeau and his staff recent explanations are flimsy, or crock, while Wilson Raybould is the only truth teller, most columnists here say it possible both sides believe their own version.If you ever been married er, sorry, Quebecers, lived common law you know you can have the same conversation and remember things very differently.Wait a minute, that not what I said last month, that what YOU said!Hah! That exactly what you always say when I say that what you said.I never thought Trudeau was the Golden Boy much of Canada and the world did when it came to transparency and revolutionizing politics, so I not angry or hurt to see he just a politician.Similarly, I believe Wilson Raybould is a highly capable, honourable person who quit a powerful job out of principle.

Community discussion suggested that this may potentially actually be a sample rather than a regular song. I dug through several sample databases to a limited extent, but that could only cover a snowflake or two on the tip of the hulking iceberg of samples out there   manual searching of those databases appears to be a highly impractical method of identification, especially so for this case where there are next to no indicators whatsoever available, and even if we assume it definitely really is a sample and not something else, there are an absolute shitload of different databases (some of which are no doubt closed and others of which are offline entirely), there appear to be no practical automated ID methods for these databases, and who knows how much of any sample would be used intact anyways..

Il existe aujourd'hui, dans presque toute l'Europe, une sensibilit et une susceptibilit maladives  la souffrance en mme temps qu'une odieuse intemprance dans la plainte, un amollissement douillet qui  l'aide de la religion et de je ne sais quel bric  brac philosophique voudrait se faire passer pour quelque chose de plus lev,   il existe un vritable culte de la souffrance. Ce qui,  mon sens, saute toujours d'emble aux yeux, c'est le manque de virilit de ce que ces cercles d'chauffs baptisent du nom de "compassion".   Il faut proscrire avec la dernire rigueur cette forme rcente du mauvais got.

The social aspect of live casino games is another relevant factor that contributes immensely to their growing popularity. Sure, there are certain players whose gaming preferences are more intimate and asocial, but the majority of bettors enjoy human interaction and being social with fellow gamblers. Live casino games make that possible. Most of the game suppliers incorporate a live chat option into their products so that participants can interact and comment on the game, broadening their experience. By using the chat option you can even communicate with the dealers who will always be friendly and supportive. Not to mention their attractive appearance and pleasant demeanor. Most of them will be young, gorgeous women, mind you; but professional and skilled, nonetheless.

I'm trying out Captivate 8's new responsive designs and HTML5 output and am very annoyed with how smartphones handle the HTML5 video. For now, I'm setting up alternate, video free content for the Mobile breakpoint. But the huge size of modern phones means that their landscape viewports are often as wide or wider than the portrait viewports of proper tablets. Is there any way I can set up alternate content based on a device being a phone (popping out video in its own player) versus a tablet (displaying video like a civilized device)? [more inside]
To Kasich, this kind of crazy Hobbesianism would "hurt small business", which presumably includes the particular lunatic who had done jail time for illegal possession of firearms and was cited multiple times for animal abuse   but still had his Animal Farm up and running in Ohio   until he granted his boarders amnesty. Because of the anti regulation zealots who have taken control of our political culture and institutions, this was the profile of someone still fit to continue to lord over a coterie of dangerous and endangered species, in his own little Jurassic Park..

I've still got my 1960 Penguin translation of Lorca's selected poems, with the original Spanish version taking pride of place on the page with the English translation relegated to mere footnotes. In 1971, when I bought it, I think it was "cool" to read Lorca. Now, confronted by a book of his prose musings on his home country, originally published there in 1918, I am overwhelmed by the word pictures he paints, accompanied by Julian Bell's gentlemanly "Englishman abroad" drawings..

Im sorry that offends you. But the picture and discussion was about people who refer to themselves as pro lifers. There are things about pro choice that offend me but thats not what I commented on. I shed some light and positive feedback that not all people who are pro life are haters in the same sentence. I can not control your body or your choices, but I can have an opinion. And although we have different beliefs in that sense we need to stick together and support each other. Setting aside legality. If you live your life being offended at everything you wont be happy. And I cant make you happy. The fact that I say Hey yeah I do support life, But I support you, and empathize with you and your struggles. Maybe you can cut some slack just because the word pro life doesnt agree with you. And see that I still support you. I think were misunderstanding who the "hater" is now.

I calmly asked her what their adoption fee was, she didn't even seem to know. Eventually she asked for a few hundred dollars. I e transferred it to her and never heard from them again.

Neuroskeptic rightly points out a major flaw in the 2012 study, namely, the classification of "expert" players was based on self reports.

We are forgetting that your costs are going to be significantly higher than a traditional physical therapist because you are mobile. In a traditional setting your real only major upkeep is the building, which is usually defrayed due to the fact that the building usually houses multiple doctors, physical therapists, etc. With your mobile format you not only have to cover the cost of your mobile format on just the two of you, but also compensate for time lost in between patients. In a traditional setting the patients come to you and wait, meaning there is really no downtime between patients for the caregiver. In your format not only will you have to drive to the person, but once there you have to wait for them to come to you. So you are looking at having adjust your prices to cover what I assuming is going to be an RV(to fit hand bikes and shit in it), the upkeep on the RV, the downtime between patients, and the non billing of health insurance, all just to meet cost. Not to mention I assuming you want to get paid for this venture, so that even more. People around here aren going to be willing to shell that much out of pocket. Especially when they have insurance with a much lower copay.
