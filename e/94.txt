Unambiguous sincerity is beyond Reynolds range as an actor, and Fleck and Boden use this to keep us guessing: is Curtis running a long con, or could he be motivated by genuine friendship?Though set in the present, the film has a deliberate retro flavour, with a blues soundtrack and frequent allusions to 20th century popular culture (Gerry imagines himself dressing up in a white suit, like the 1970s country legend Glen Campbell).Softer and sweeter than these forerunners, the film is basically a chaste romance between the two men, with the gentle pace allowing ample time to dwell on their fond amusement at each other; women are marginal, including Sienna Miller in a typically thankless "girlfriend" role.

That said, I also rather disagree somewhat with this notion in that most of the Midwest larger cities (Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Columbus, Indianapolis, Buffalo) are already returning, driven by a combination of good bones and cheap CoL (especially by Northeastern or West Coast standards). good quality intercity rail) would help accelerate the process along.

This guy doesn even know that women have 12 periods a year unless they get pregnant or don have them monthly for a health reason. Even if he was right about needing 10 tampons for your period, which is why wrong since they have to be changed every 4 8 hours so that at least 3 6 tampons a day, AT LEAST, he would be wrong about how many are needed. At the very least, this is if the girl is one of the lucky ones with a 3 day long period and she only has to change it 3 times a day since that the least amount of times that you can change it, that nine per cycle and that the lowest it can be. More likely, girls will change it at least 6 times a day and let say it 5 7 days, since that the average. On average a girl would use 30 42 tampons, at least, during a cycle. Then every month so that is 360 504 per year. And depending on the girl, it could be more or it could be less. Point is, this guy doesn know shit about girls or periods, even though if he just looked up three questions: How long do periods last? How often do girls have periods? How often do tampons have to be changed?, he would have gotten the same results that I just did.

WTF Eventz brings international gamers and teams to Digital Games Carnival in India
I asked the question in title to a professional MTT playing friend of mine. He a live pro that plays $5000 $10000 buyin tournaments around the world, including the WSOP Main Event, Aussie Millions, SHRPO, EPT and WPT main events. He gave me some good insight. He says that it really doesn matter which format of poker you decide to play, but your success primarily depends on your dedication to the game and self discipline. He never specifically answered which of the three options was easiest to beat, but he did tell me that somebody playing (a solid game) live cash in Vegas, Atlantic City, Los Angeles, or Florida would win money considerably faster (on average) than a player who plays $500 $1000 tournaments, live or online. He doesn play online much, other than the couple WSOP online bracelet events every year, and thinks that online is much too hard to beat nowadays. He says that the average player in an online tournament is only there to win money with their game that they been studying/practicing for hundreds or thousands of hours. And when you look at $500 $1000 online tournaments, most of the people playing them are the ones who have won millions of dollars online. Flip over to $500 $1000 live tournaments, where you see tournaments like MSPT, WPTDeepstacks and WSOP Circuit, where a sizable amount of the players there want to cash, but they dont put any time into studying their game, other than that one Daniel Negreanu training video they watched on YouTube uploaded in 2009. They have basically zero chance of winning these tournaments with their outdated ABC 2009 strategy, but they still keep coming back for the experience and that dream of winning.

Omdat het er flink op lijkt dat mannen en vrouwen biologisch veel minder van elkaar verschillen dan we denken, zker in onze jeugd, kan ik me voorstellen dat het nogal ingedramd is bij vrouwen dat je "moet" trouwen, en dan bij voorkeur met een knappe, rijke man. Het wordt zelfs in veel kindersprookjes en jeugdfilms als "hoogste doel" neergezet (denk aan bijna alle Disney prinsessen, bijna alle sappige kerstfilms en alle films die de Bechdel test niet halen).Ik vermoed (hoop!) dat dit op termijn gaat bijdraaien. 
In truth we have forsaken the right to call Iqbal our national poet. What commonality is there between his poetry and our way of life? The way our leaders conduct themselves   fawning when they should know better not to, listening to lectures when they should have the wit and understanding to educate foreigners about the reality of Pakistan and its neighbourhood   shows no sympathy or connection with Iqbal. There should be no commemoration of Iqbal Day and no changing of the guard at his tomb   betwixt Lahore's great mosque and the imposing fa of Akbar's fort   until we learn to conduct ourselves with greater national dignity..

Every other major industrialized economy already has a Value Added Tax so it should not be a major issue. The VAT that I proposing is lower than that of most other major economies   half the average European level for example. The real question is, how would entrepreneurs respond to having every adult consumer getting an additional $12,000 of buying power per year AND having a guaranteed income of $12,000 a year oneself? We would see an explosion of entrepreneurship on a scale that we have never seen. A mindset of abundance goes hand in hand with entrepreneurship and that is what the Freedom Dividend will enable for millions of Americans.

Advantages and Disadvantages Qualitative career assessments add a personal element to the counseling mix, allowing a counselor to take your self awareness into consideration. This is useful for people who already have experience and knowledge of a work environment. Self awareness is not always objective, however, and the individual's view of what he can or cannot do may not be accurate. Quantitative assessments look at hard data and can "prove" skills or latent ability. This is useful for younger people with less life experience, but it cannot factor individual preferences and experiences into the mix.

Shape It Up Traditionally, business cards are 3 1/2 inch by 2 inch rectangles, but there is no hard and fast rule that relegates you to these standards.

Tailpiece: The army chief, Gen Ashfaq Kayani, has grown on the job and is definitely a more confident man than when he took over from Musharraf. The Malakand operation and preparations for an assault on Waziristan have to a large extent rehabilitated the army's image, badly tarnished by Musharraf's policies. But it would be a pity if any of this went to Kayani's head. We need good and able military commanders. But we've had enough of military saviours and can do without more in the future. And, perhaps, we can do without army chiefs trying to become F 16 aces. A flight through the clouds of Waziristan   a final victory lap, so to speak   may be in order once Baitullah Mehsud is beaten. Without the Pakistan army actively engaged in the border regions called FATA, American and NATO forces in Afghanistan would be hard pressed to sustain their ground. Any innocent could be forgiven for thinking that given this crucial role some gratitude and some ungrudging help would come Pakistan's way. But what the United States is pleased to offer in the shape of the Kerry Lugar bill is peanuts: 1.5 billion dollars a year, for five years.

One of my highschool English teacher was always super flirtatious and creepy towards the females in the class and always bragged that he was friends with Sean William Scott in highschool. Turns out he was a peeping tom, even worse he lived next door to our wood shop teachers daughter and got caught jerking off to her when he husband saw him standing in their backyard watching her undressing through the window, he football tackled him and held him until the cops arrived, and the following week Tannahill was forced to resign. Even more scary is she had reported seeing a suspicious male multiple times looking at her through the window over the last year or two but had never caught him until then. Not sure what ever became of him but it was a scandalous and the buzz of the school for the rest of the year and the shop teacher was this big burly intimidating man who wore all denim outfits everyday, i would not have wanted to mess with him.

So while craps moves at 100 or so rolls per hour and blackjack about 60 hands per hour, roulette moves at a more stately pace   roughly 45 spins per hour.

X ray? or just second opinion? more palpation. etc?The simple field tests I mentioned, and thermal imaging are probably best   thermal imaging has the potential to expose a problem (or more accurately an area of injury) which hasn been considered or which was erroneously ruled out. X rays for those problems would require recumbency (putting her totally under and laying her down), but the catch 22 is those injuries are also likely to be seriously aggravated as she wakes up and tries to get her footing (I personally had a horse break his leg waking up after colic surgery, requiring his euthanasia   and he was even in a recovery room purpose built to prevent injuries as they come out of anesthesia), so tbh I wouldn recommend radiographs unless your vet it super confident it can be done safely.Honestly, aside from thermography your best bet for deciding neurologic vs mechanical injury might be a course of strong anti inflammatories and Robaxin (or similar muscle relaxer) for a week, followed by a dose of analgesic (one which provides good relief of pain without significant motor impairment) and concurrent lameness exam.

The jury's still out on exactly what needs to happen to rectify the issue, but most industry experts agree that something needs to be done. The Air Carrier Access Act lists the specific rules regarding service animals and ESAs aboard aircraft and states that airlines may request documentation for ESAs, such as the type Delta will require.

As a consequence of developing business to business partnerships for the last 10 years, as of June 2011, PMU was involved in 57 international partnerships, nine of which benefit from sharing PMU immense betting pool. These business to business partnerships represented 384 million (US$516.9 million) in 2010 revenues. To continue growing, might PMU now be free to consider more than just business to business partnerships through the acquisition of a foreign operator and provide direct business to consumer betting services? Before the aggravation of the European crisis, Odie, PMU Greek homologue and current partner, was a noteworthy candidate with which to examine a new business model of expanded control in a foreign market..

Winners are enduring: The triumphant players are usually tolerant. It is often seen that the players do get impatient after the dealing of hand after hand of debris cards.

So recently my computer has been running great, but as of late its been black screening (so far twice). The first was a few days ago, I stepped out of my room to go downstairs for a while and do some things and when I came back I noticed that my monitor was off (power still on, but the screen was black). So I thought to myself, oh it just turned the monitor off because its been 20 minutes (thats what I have it set to) and when I tried to make it come back it wouldn't. I also noticed that the keyboard had froze up and NumLock was stuck too, so the computer locked up. However it didn't blue screen or turn off the computer, the screen was just black and unresponsive.

And that is what struck me seeing the reasoning for this "atomic bomb car" it really is just a car with a high creep factor that is outfitted for camping, but it is being sold in the patent as a ways for urban dwellers to survive the coming nuclear holocaust (" our greater areas of human congestion have slowly begun to face the threat of eventual atomic destruction").

Both of the weapons used by Lubke aircraft seem as though they would be devastating, and indiscriminate. (Politicians would pull away from the idea of attacking civilian areas and sign treaties to that effect that all went away with the invasion of China by Japan, and the attack upon cities by Nazi forces in WWII the Allies followed suit almost immediately thereafter.) Lubke image (which appears in the section titled "Der Zukunftskrieg und die Technik") must have seemed terrifying to his readers of 1927, though they are at least spared the image of the effects on the population in the imagery of the attack. Of course things rapidly in the few years following that, so that by the end of WWI people got a good taste of what it meant to controlling pieces of property without actually occupying them, raining chaos and destruction from above.

It makes a broader conceptual contribution to bodywork literatures, advocating the importance of extending analysis beyond social constructionist approaches and questioning the takenforgranted understandings of materiality that are most often drawn upon in order to attend to the kinds of knowledge that are less easy to formalise, anomalous, or that push at the fringes of the definite or the limits of the believable, but which are nonetheless central to many different kinds of bodywork contemporarily.. 
Negro was the politically correct term for black people for much of the 20th century (although it would be an offensive term today).

Choose the best parts of your body: I always put myself in front of the mirror and try to note what parts of my body I really like and which ones I don't. I look at my lips, my legs, my arms, my abdomen, my bust. I observe every detail of my body. I know I have some things that I don't really like.

Another thing that is most striking about Marcel is that he wears suits while most of the other players of the present times appear in casuals or informal dresses.

Before it is of much use, crude oil must be processed into petroleum products, and this is where refineries come in. So back to our martini example: During the refining process, the vodka becomes a martini as other ingredients get mixed in   or crude oil becomes gas.

A branded station   think Exxon or BP   can only buy its contracted brand of gasoline, which boasts a special recipe.

It like an Uber ride; the meter just keeps getting reset to 0 after every fight and you want to keep coming back for more KOs. It's like an addiction, you want the urge (of seeing the KO) satisfied over and over and over but the longer you don't get it fulfilled the more restless you become. 
The reason people are having to be forced to take vaccines in this day and age is because people decided to stop taking them on a basis of risk that isn solidly backed up, and the benefits of vaccines are well enough documented that when use has fallen and we seeing re emergence of what were increasingly uncommon disease outbreaks, it is a pretty simple public health measure to mandate them, in some way or another.

I really enjoyed the Loire Valley, Chennonceaux and Cheverny, in particular. Etretat, about an hour north of Paris is a picturesque idyll, long favored by artists. Bayeux has an historic harbor, excellent crepes, and a spectacular wooden church, built by the region highly skilled shipwrights. Normandie beaches are moving and beautiful   have a Kir Nourmande. Mont St. Michel is further west, but well worth a visit to the stunning tidal flat surrounded monastery. I would recommend a rental car, to get the most out of your time.

Coconut water is naturally found inside young coconuts, and it contains a wide variety of minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, amino acids, and enzymes.It contains negligible fatty acids compared to coconut milk, which is a liquid obtained by grating the solid inside of the coconut. Coconut oil, a third health conveying food, is oil extracted from the meat of the mature coconut.Side note: Good video on Coconut oilIn a review in the journal Molecules, researchers call coconut water "a refreshing and nutritious beverage which is widely consumed due to its beneficial properties to health, some of which are based on cultural/traditional beliefs."In remote regions coconut water is well known as an oral and intravenous rehydration solution.Coconut water is famous for containing the electrolytes potassium and sodium, which are important for keeping the body properly hydrated.Potassium exists in every cell in the body, and one of its main roles is to draw water inside cells to maintain hydration.Sodium exists in the extra cellular fluid of every cell and is also involved in drawing water into the cells.An imbalance in these two minerals can cause serious problems with hydration and adrenal fatigue.Coconut water also provides a nice dose of vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, arginine, alanine, lysine, glutamic acid, and other micronutrients and enzymes that are anti inflammatory.In 100 grams of coconut water, there are about 5 grams of carbs of which half is glucose and half is fructose.Coconut water has received some negative press due to the aggressive marketing claims made by coconut water companies and because analysis of the chemical composition of the most popular varieties contained about half the sodium and 75 percent of the magnesium listed.Errors in listed ingredient content are not rare in the food industry, and the main concern with coconut water is whether it is pure or diluted since you shouldn't be relying on a beverage for all your nutrient intake needs anyway.The main advantage of drinking coconut water is that it provides extra electrolytes and antioxidants when you are training, making it useful for rehydration and great for overall health.Exercise, Hydration, and Coconut WaterRecent studies have shown coconut water is equally as effective as straight water or a carbohydrate electrolyte sport drink in replenishing fluids after exhaustive exercise, whereas word of mouth reports suggest it is far superior to water and sports drink options.The most recent study in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found no statistical difference between water, coconut water, and a sports drink on rehydration, heart rate, blood pressure, or performance from 90 minutes of exhaustive exercise in trained men.The coconut water did produce slightly better blood volume restoration than the other beverages.It's possible that the benefits of coconut water would be clinically significant on hydration status and performance if it was used for hydration regularly for a longer period rather than just one time, as in this study.Researchers note that coconut water may be preferable to sports drinks because it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup or added sugar, and the electrolytes and vitamins are naturally occurring rather than added in.Plus, it has rich antioxidant properties, which aid in neutralizing reactive oxygen species produced after endurance exercise.Antioxidant Benefits of Coconut WaterThe antioxidant content in coconut water may actually be one of its greatest benefits.It contains a wealth of micronutrients such as inorganic ions and vitamins that enhance the natural antioxidant system of the body. 
A friend of mine is from El Salvador ( I live in Sweden) and he has quite a remarkable story. He waas living with his poor family in el salvador but he was really good at poker, so one night he hits the big local tournament and wins a couple thousand dollars.

Berkshire Eagle: Angst over internet speedsNo, I not kidding. I noticed reports on this post so I checked it out, as I supposed to do, and I agree with the reports. It doesn fit because you just found footprints in the snow. Nothing actually happened to you. You claim you found footprints in the snow that were allegedly following you. The footprints could have been made at another time, as you never actually saw or had any indication that anyone was following you. Some could argue that this could be fake, as anyone could have made those footprints to take a pic and post a story on here. I not saying your story is fake because I have no idea, but it would be very easy to do and many people have posted fake stories on here. This isn personal and I have nothing against you, it just doesn fit in LNM, which is why I suggested /r/creepyencounters. If you had actually encountered someone stalking you or something happened, that would be different and would be allowed on LNM.

From antelope to zebra and all the wildlife in between, Africa's stunning fauna inspires hundreds of adventure tours a year, including those of Ultimate Africa Safaris, whose scheduled group trips (with eight travelers max) and customized tours come with little to no single fees attached. These Seattle based travel specialists create high quality, all inclusive safaris complete with airfare, travel insurance, and camping or luxury accommodations to suit all styles and tastes.

The call of the wild has never sounded better.
