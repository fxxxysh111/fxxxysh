They reveal latent abilities and the potential to do specific jobs, and show whether you have the capacity to follow a particular career.

But Netflix's not at all disinterested assessment overlooks how more traditional programmers have worked to de emphasize the importance of the hoary ad sales hustle. After having raked in billions of dollars in retransmission fees, syndication deals and other revenue streams directly reliant upon studio provenance, CBS has shifted from a business that was fundamentally in thrall to commercial bucks to a company that thrives on the back end. Last May, CBS announced that ad sales revenue accounted for just 46 percent of the overall dollars it had raked in during the previous quarter, a far cry from the 72 percent chunk that sponsors contributed in 2010..

Use cerium oxide. Many jewelers use cerium oxide to polish gemstones and precious stones. You can also use this to remove the scratches on your mirror. You can buy glass polishing kits from the hardware store. If you have plenty of mirrors or glass that you want to restore, you can invest in the kit. Just mix the cerium oxide powder with a bit of water until you form a pasty substance. Spread the paste on the scratched area on your mirror and use the buffer in the kit to work it on the scratch. Wipe off the paste to inspect the scratch. It may take a while to completely remove the scratch on your mirror but it can be done with a bit of hard work. You can purchase the kit from Glass Polishing Kit.

Reddit has a way of taking what feels like shallow internet courtesy on other social media in the form of "likes" and occasionally comments and makes them feel a lot more real. Maybe it's anonymity or the downvote option, but when I get comments here I feel genuine connection and have great dialogue with folks. This is probably why the negative feedback feels so awful, the contrast feels so GOOD. I've never cared what people say to me online, good or bad. But on here I get a sense of validation and feel like people are actually reading what I have to say to understand and not just to reply or make a weak ass joke or just agree with me. I've never gotten any of this from Twitter, FB or IG.

Washington Roebling took over as chief engineer following the death of his father, John A., in 1869, following a freak accident and the ill conceived treatments for it that brought on the tetanus that wound up killing the man.

Also, they don't do this. There is a lot of intuition and guesswork because you have imperfect information. Just as an example   there are a lot of people who really like betting big if there is a pair on the board   which is a classic bluff   people will think you have three of a kind and fold. If you've played this guy a bunch, then you know that and you will be more likely to call with two pair than you would against an unknown player. But then again, he also knows that you've played him a bunch and will call him on it, and so he might have been playing cautiously which makes it more likely that he wouldn't be bluffing you, and so on.

It used to be a great brand, but not so much anymore. I bought a lot of M stuff for my kid, most of it between 4 and 6 years ago now and the vast majority of it was superb. I have bought several things in the last year or two that I had for my son for younger kids in the family and most of it is not the same, sadly. Like I bought an identical wooden puzzle for my nephew. My son has heavy wood pieces that are painted nicely and show little to no wear even though he frequently chewed on them. The animal pieces were thick and could stand up on their own. The identical puzzle I got for my nephew has stickers instead of paint and the pieces are too thin to stand up on their own. It a bummer because they were one of the few affordable, easily accessible quality toy brands in the US.
?The overwhelming response we received to the live Poker event was an indication of widening audience interest in Poker. We hope that Card Enthusiasts were presented with a compelling enough case to take up this beautiful card game ? if they hadn?t yet ? which can be enjoyed in its myriad forms, what with the beer flowing and the high stakes action that unfolded at each of these Poker events! Concerns regarding the game?s legitimacy as an activity that can be freely pursued across India have always come in the way of its widespread acceptance. In this light, it is hoped that KhelPlay Tournaments would serve to stimulate user interest and lead to the mushrooming of a ?Poker culture? across India. Not just Poker, but even co working spaces such as ours would stand to benefit from this.?

You proved the point in your own comment. Your first rag clears you likely had some raid members wearing crap gear like t1 sets. Nobody knew about all the rare drops in the game, nobody had spreadsheet bis lists. You got a purple and you assumed it was better than your blue. Dps was a lot slower. As a result the fight lasts longer and more healing is required so it makes sense for more raid members to wear FR. Modern raids are only taking minimal damage and are chugging fire protection potions.

Not really just my character, but my paladin and my friends cleric have a combo called "Divine Deadlock", which involves the paladin casting Compelled Duel on an enemy and then the Cleric casting sanctuary on the Paladin, while Paladin takes the dodge action (flavored as planting the shield hard between him and his opponent). The fantasy was of having the enemy mind go kaboom from being torn between attacking nobody but the paladin and yet attacking everybody sans paladin. Even though mechanically the monster still can attempt to attack anybody, I like that combo a lot and it was my very first spell combo I came up with in DnD.

However, the idea that we censor or remove all posts that make the game look bad is not true and we will defend ourselves here. We believe that just as much good content that is produced on the subreddit, there does need to be the posts that enlighten the issues in the game. Its an important factor that the community is aware of these posts that enlighten these issues as this helps improve the game in the long run. Posts that can further advance discussion, including but not limited to cheating videos and bug reports such as a well thought out post that can provide possible solutions, or express the general concern in a mature and valuable way, we would like to welcome these posts just as much as others. We feel another video of cheating does not do this, and so they will be removed.

I was homeschooled by my religious parents until I was 14, and the "science" textbooks I was given were EXACTLY like this. It was even more pathetic though, because obviously high school science requires more detail/explanation than grade school. The desperate wrangling that had to go on to "prove" the earth was 6000 years old would be hilarious if not for the disturbing fact that so many people believe it with VICIOUS certainty. To this day I can go to museums with my parents, because every mention of "5 million years ago" etc sends them on a rant about "how could anyone not see this is intelligent design??" They both (otherwise) educated people, and it drives me nuts. Religion can turn anyone into a fool.
There is a probabilistic element to it, yes. But it still doesn explain why matter won out. Let use the coin flipping analogy, because it seems useful here. Say you flipped a coin once, and it comes up heads. Not unexpected. Say you flipped a coin ten times, and it comes up heads 6 times, and tails 4 times. Still not unexpected. Say you flipped it a hundred times, and it comes up heads 60 times, and tails 40 times. Now it starts to get strange. Say you flipped the coin a quintillion times, and you still get significantly more heads. While technically possible, it is extremely unlikely with a fair coin, so the reasonable assumption is that the coin is not fair. Thus, in the same way, we know that there is almost certainly some reason the universe favors matter. We just aren sure why it does.

 5 points  submitted 2 days agoWhy are posts that are tweets/content videos from the official teams being removed? I can see an argument if it was in not English w/o subs, but the rest of the content is all great and it's amazing to see more teams doing something this season, so their content should be visible to everyone and not removed because of some rule. Official Team content/tweets etc should be an exception as they are the official pro teams either making a meme about a match, or giving insight to how their team works, no reason any of that should be removed since it's the pro teams you watch play this game. 1 point  submitted 2 days agoNot everything nor am I say everything like you imply. A pro team talking about a match on twitter is on the relevancy scale and a pro team publishing highlights of their voice comms and life leading up to those matches is 100% very relevant as its insight to how a pro league team plays league. If you guys are going to keep nuking posts that are just those things then get rid of the pro team flairs and stop posting match results, otherwise you are having one without the other when you should have both and not having both is being hypocritical. Also so with the initial posts yesterday that got removed that prompted to ask my question they all had different reasons which didn't make sense that weren't relevancy.Edit: an example of how bad it is to remove posts that pertains to the pro teams is it's a like a food and health based sub reddit banning posts about sugar and artificial sugar but allowing posts about candy.

I just have to deal with so many idiots that think that they can deal with the issues we find themselves without understanding the entire situation. Yes, you can probably deal with the issue yourself, but if that doesn fix it, or so other issue presents itself that the original was a symptom to, then can you deal with that?

Once popular in many online bingo sites only as mini games, slot games have changed the way people view such sites. Today, these games are not merely an additional attraction but very much a part of all the major online bingo sites. A bingo site without the presence of even a couple of slots and other instant games is exceptional in the present times and not in a good way. 
He had a hard time in college; didn't like his major but didn't have any other ideas, had a hard time being motivated to attend class, etc. The final straw was when he ended a semester and was trying to get ready for the next semester: he was dropped by the scholarship that was paying his tuition for not making above a 3.5.

You can forget about Frandsen. There is no hope and minor league numbers mean nothing. Linden and Mark leonard used to dominate in the minor but pitchers in minor don have the control that ML pitchers do. Frandsen is an extremely aggresive hitter like Ellison so ML pitchers w/ good control can get them out by not throwing srikes to frandsen. BTW, does that sound like someone we know ?
Even the earliest UFC fights had rules that all athletes were expected to follow.

When as managers (at various levels) we meet job seeking candidates, first we have a profile to read and form an impression, that is imaginary; then we get to meet the person and form an opinion on the visible attributes, both the self created and naturally blessed, and finally through conversation, we endeavor into the difficult task of peering into his outward personality for discovering the invisible traits.

He was knocked out that year short of winning money. "But I got hooked," he says. "There was no way I wasn't playing in '09, and that earlier experience really helped me this year." He has since joined the private equity firm Flexpoint Ford as a partner, and has no plans to turn poker pro for many reasons, but not least because he feels it would take him away from his family (he has three children at home) and, he says, because he loves his job.

It is for the very first time that the gambling products are challenging the supplementary types of products meant for the amusement of the common masses for attracting the interest of the people and their expenditure.

Also, as much as we make fun of the whole "wait for Goku" thing, it actually a much bigger issue in Dragon Ball than in Dragon Ball Z. Not only does Goku regularly leave behind his friends in Dragon Ball, but the only other person who really gets any noteworthy win is when Tien beats Tao (who Goku had already defeated.) In Dragon Ball Z, the other characters get major fights and major wins, or at the very least they mostly team efforts. Goku trounced Nappa, sure, but Vegeta defeat was a team effort of Goku, Gohan, Krillin, and Yajirobe.

When the vocals end, you think the song is over but then the song comes back again and explodes into an absolutely jaw dropping climax which is just the best thing I ever heard.

Still working on it but here are a few major things that have contributed to losing the weight so far: Logging all food in myfitnesspal and maintaining a caloric deficit  Food is now fuel, not fun (your new mantra)  Lifting weights a few times per week and progressively increasing weight and volume (increases your TDEE)  Some form of cardio at least 3x per week. I mostly stick with the elliptical, especially at 220 lbs where running can be hard on the kneesGet started by doing this meticulously for 3 weeks. It will then become much easier as you used to going to the gym all the time and are in a new rhythm of eating.

I about the farthest thing from being blonde. I just don think people should be changing their hair colour simply because it may make them more likely to find a partner. If someone has a rainbow mohawk, that one thing, but blonde is still a natural colour, and if someone thinks they look better as a blonde, I don think they should feel the need to change it just because some study said men think brunettes are better to marry. Until it comes out that men are actively refusing to date or marry someone who dyed their hair blonde, this advice seems really over the top.
There are significant discounts on some things (although it is true that some of the super discounts on things such as TVs are on specifically made versions that are poorer quality) and then more average sale prices on other things. For instance, a target may have all boys clothes 20% off with certain boys clothing items even cheaper. So in aggregate, you could save a lot of money if everything you buy is discounted. Practically the whole store is on sale on Black Friday to some degree. The super discounts are called "door busters" and you can save a lot of money on them. For instance you could save $100 on an iPad mini and is the same quality of any other iPad you would buy. People are commenting that all things on sale are poorer quality or were marked up in the first place. That isn't entirely accurate. Well, at least not at the stores I worked at in undergrad. For instance I bought my sister a $30 sweater for $10 today. It really does cost $30 regularly. Last night I bought my niece and insta pot for half off ($50 instead of $100) last year I got my son his first laptop and saved around $200 dollars. I would never fight someone over a discount and wasn't raised to shop of Black Friday. So I am not condoning this, but just providing background. Oddly enough, most fights I have seen are over insignificant discounts or poor quality items. I do all my Black Friday shopping online these days because it seems to draw out the worst people and/or the worst in people.

His "concessions" are actually acknowledgements of the existing injunctions issued by the courts that are preventing the government from actively destroying these policies in the first place, but with promised timelines that extend beyond Trump term, and are therefore irrelevant.

A poker hand such as JTM JTM 4TM 4TM 9TM , that contains two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank (that match each other but not the first pair), plus any card not of either rank, is called two pair. If both hands have the same top pair, then the second pair of each is compared, such that 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM 4TM defeats 10TM 10TM 4TM 4TM 8TM . If both hands have the same two pairs, the kicker determines the winner, so 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM ATM beats 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM 4TM . Two pair are described by the higher pair first, followed by the lower pair if necessary; KTM KTM 9TM 9TM 5TM is described as "Kings over nines", "Kings and nines", or simply "Kings up" if the nines are not important. The same if player one has 2,2,K,K,7 and player two has 2,2,J,J,K player one would win because his Cowboys(pair of Kings) beats player two's Fishing Hooks(Jacks). Lets say Player one has 2,2,5,5,8 and player two has 2,2,5,5,J. Player two would win because of his Jack.

Jetzt knnte man entweder sagen "was beschftigt dich eigentlich gerade zur Zeit?", oder aber man hat eine sinnloses und oberflchliches Gesprch ber "damals"; oder man fixiert sich eben auf die Kinder (dazu kann jeder etwas sagen), oder auf die Krankheiten (auch da kann jeder Mitreden).

That great feedback. And you are very correct. But there is a lot of room for discussion. Today a large ground war against the US would be very foolish. There is not a single military adviser who would go toe to toe. It would almost resort to guerilla style tactics and insurgency, nothing really new here. The only difference is that we arent fighting through korea, or through vietnam, etc. We will know where the banks are, the critical infrastructure. Most of china military relies on rail road to relocate through out the country. Easy for drones to stop all that. China would have trouble paying and even feeding it troops.

Offbeat observation: The drink I really want is the Indian Sidecar, which has drawn a lot of attention even though nobody has ordered one since the casino opened. Probably because it costs $25,000. (My Globe laptop would electrocute me if I tried to put that on an expense report.) The drink is mixed with 118 year old cognac and comes with a new Indian motorcycle, a brand originally produced in Springfield. The gleaming bike is on display in the Commonwealth Bar and Lounge on the gambling floor, where the cocktail is on the menu. They ship the motorcycle to your house, apparently; you don get to fire it up and roar out of the casino, which would be much cooler. (Did I get paid to stay up all night partying? Nope.

When you say a "safe" way of gambling, I am assuming that you are talking about being able to gamble without getting carried away and losing your house, your car, and life savings. If this is the case, it all begins with your mindset. Nobody really wants to lose in gambling but you have to accept the fact that you can and will lose money. If you win, thats great. But you must resolve yourself to the understanding that gambling is a losing game more than it is a winning game.

This is a huge red flag. While it might be okay to start being more comfortable with your partner chipping in for groceries or paying for a meal now and then at 3 months, it is far from okay to straight up ask for someone at that stage to just give you that much money, even as a loan. Tell her you don have the budget to help her at this time but perhaps she can talk to her bank about refinancing options. Alternatively you can offer to have more low budget date nights so she can better budget to cover her mortgage if she is struggling with making payments.

It depends on your interpretation of how the power is transferred. I always imagined power from Patrons is actually more like a one time bank transfer that matures over time   like in sorcerers, they don't actually get more powerful over time, they just learn how to harness power potential they already have as they 'level up'   for warlocks it's the same   the pact gives them the power, but once given they can't retract the powers given, even if the pact is unfulfilled   that's the risk the patron undergoes as a character: if the pact has not been completed (eg release uktoa for life and power) when the powers are given over, they risk the warlock running off with their already infused eldritch power. Clerics and Paladins (and to a lesser extent, druids) are a little more complicated, the powers I think are still given over, however if they deny following one god, like an oath breaker they are simply picked up by another god, the pieces of the divine game of chess are still needed by all, and they change their domain if they break their oath or turn away from their god.
There is something else to this story too: what about people who aren in couples but have intimate and even sexual relationships with people who are not their spouses? They too will be allowed to choose who visits them in the hospital by choosing a "circle of intimates." that a good thing.

Since you already established that having wealthy parents gives you an advantage over everyone else, how do you think the advantage for a black kid versus as a white kid played out in 1960? Let's pretend that the civil rights movement was 100% effective and wiped out all racism and race based discrimination, thats two generations of "equal footing" to get to the present day. But as you pointed out, better off parents create advantage for their kids, so if an average white kid born in 1960 did exactly the same as a black kid born in 1960, you would expect the white kid to come out ahead because the parents gave an advantage.

The short answer is, that they believe we are on the run in Afghanistan and they want to push us out faster. Mullen has been Pakistan's strongest advocate inside the White House situation room since President Obama took office in 2009..

Their business is merely finding new and creative ways to frame the ongoing "war" so that it can always be a problem, they can always be victims or signal their allegiance to the victim class, and they can gain imaginary moral currency similar to how the war on drugs has no interest in doing away with any substantial problems, and seeks only to ensure the cycle becomes more firmly entrenched in society so they will perpetually have a hard to define boogeyman to "fight". This phenomenon is nothing new..
