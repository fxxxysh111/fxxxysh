I once read an article about how most people fit into one of two social "cultures." There the "offer culture" of people who wait for something to be offered and would never dream of asking for something that wasn already on offer, because they see that as being rude. Then there the "ask culture", people who feel it okay to ask for anything because the other party is free to say decline their request. ("What the harm in asking? The worst they can say is no!"). 
I wouldn say he necessarily easily killed his wife. He may not even have meant to kill her, but to restrain her. Anyone knows after about 3 minutes there is no more resuscitation without serious brain damage. If he had called 911 and told them my wife killed our children and now I killed my wife, do you think anyone would have believed him any more than they do now? The best case scenario would have been if he had fled the home leaving wife there and gone to police or restrained wife and called police.

Bluffing is just a nice word for lying. What you're attempting to do is to either completely conceal your emotions so that no one can tell what it is you're feeling, or (and this is a lot harder) give a false impression of your feelings. The goal is to throw your opponents at the table off to either let them think they're going to win (when you have a good hand) or to make them think they're going to lose (when you have nothing worth playing). It isn't an easy skill to pick up, but for those who find that acting comes naturally to them it is a skill that can make you a fantastic card player. Just don't overdo it. hamming it up at the table will cost you just as if you were hamming it up on stage.

It wasn even an "I believe you". I called out the player who folded the Ace, who confirmed and said something to the effect of "sorry about that, I be more careful in the future".

Let's say you get a dent in the hood   nothing too drastic, just a shallow, even dent with no sharp creases in an area that's pretty easy to reach. You think it'll be easy to pop it out on your own, so you begin to massage the underside while holding your shaping tool in place. You've made good progress so far, and a casual observer wouldn't even notice the flawed area. But it's not exactly perfect, and since it's been fairly easy to this point, you decide to keep massaging the area to make it flawless. After a few more minutes of massaging, you realize that you've pushed it just a little too far. And now you've got this flabby area on the hood where you stretched out the metal. And there's no easy way to shrink it back down. Keep going and it'll stretch even more. Lesson learned. And it's a pain in the butt. And it's expensive. And I've also made some bad calls in terms of judging what I can handle myself . and what I'd just make worse. That said, I've never bought a product from an infomercial to attempt a car repair.

Most experts agree that in Hold'em you should see the flop only about 20 percent of the time. Many players believe because you have four hole cards in Omaha/8 instead of two, you can see more flops. This is only true if you want to be a losing player. The fact is you should see only about 20 percent of the flops in Omaha/8 as well. Starting hand selection is at least as important in Omaha/8 as it is in Hold'em, perhaps even more so.

Over time, the complexity of IT procurement has increased geometrically. In one dimension, the overall scope of IT expands constantly businesses find new uses for data, demanding that they store, process, analyze and act on information to enhance existing processes and launch new activities.

For each market that commoditizes (like PCs), dozens of new areas, such as software defined infrastructure, mobility management and security, location based services and network communications, become more granular and attract new entrants.

The gaming control board's proposal is set to go into effect next month unless a Joint Committee on Administrative Rules acts by April 30 to stop it. The board has for monthsfor dealing with so called "millionaire parties" that allow nonprofit groups to raise funds by hosting casino style games such as Texas Hold 'em and blackjack. It wanted stricter rules to address problems with gaming violations, violence and other problems at some permanent poker rooms. State officials contend the law was never designed for what has become a multi million dollar industry. But charities, poker room operators, dealers and players all

But Sarah Palin will not be vacationing on Martha Vineyard for the same reason that Bristol will not be having the perfect wedding there for the same reason that Palin was chewed up and spit up by the coastal media elites: Palin is completely and utterly impoverished when it comes to educational and social capital.

Going to the right sort of schools allows you to meet the "right people" and get to go to the "right places" on vacation, places like Martha Vineyard.

Bluffing is all about acting and betting inside a way which can be totally unrelated for the actual position of condition in the player. For instance, if a player has negative hand, but he nevertheless wager within a way as if she or he includes a good a single, then it means that he or she is bluffing. A player with powerful hands pretending to be a weaker opponent can also be a approach to bluff.

So your argument now seems to be that the others contribute to gameplay, so we can brush those off. But the only reason black female nazi exist in COD is because you can customize your character. In other words, this does add to the gameplay. You can have black characters, and you can have female characters, and roughly half the time you will be playing as a German. There is no agenda being pushed. Nobody is trying to rewrite history. Everyone knows that female soldiers represented a tiny fraction of the fighting force during WWII. But modern gamers demand character customization. People have complained here because Battlefield has no customizable character models. It is simply there to add more variety. According to the developers, the single player campaign will be far more historically accurate (in CODs overblown style I am sure).

I play a mix of online and live 1/2. Something you will definitely have to get used to is the pace of live play. Live plays so much slower than online and without the option of playing 6 max it feels even slower. That being said live is softer than 1cent 2 cent from my experience, I only play at night on the weekends when it is really soft. I would suggest playing tighter than you do online. Even at the lowest stakes online it is rare to see a pot get raised and have all the players come along, in live 1/2 this is almost standard. My strategy has been to bet big preflop with premium hands and try to get in cheaply with suited connectors and medium pocket pairs. I have consistently raised to 15 dollars preflop with Aces and gotten at least one caller sometimes 2. If they make top pair they usually won lay down their hand to continued aggression as well. If your pocket pair or suited connector hits start betting big for value especially if the pot is multiway or if you think the board might hit the villain range in any way again the biggest leak is in 1/2 is not being able to get away from a made hand. Now you should be aware that there will most likely be at least one or two good players at the table with you. But these players are easy to spot, if you get in a pot heads up with them don be afraid to actually play cards with them. But with the usual 1/2 player, you can play your hands very straightforwardly and still make a profit.

So like, it takes me noticeable effort to even see if I have eggs with gaia or if I can collect from a habitat.

It just sucks because my eyes physically hurt from playing this game. And this is bad design in general. (You can definitely do grayscales that are more accessible.)

Sergeant Phillips folded his long frame into a squad car, pistol secure in the holster on his hip, and headed out that way, crossing Main, passing the looming gray feed mill with a red warning light at its highest point, bumping over the railroad tracks as he did, passing the stores on Broadway, closed for the evening, crossing Fourth Street, speeding north toward where Broadway becomes one of the highways into town.

Talking to a friend at an private university in the US, I asked if she will get the vaccine. "Oh, we go the vaccine back in October. Because someone at the university has connections to the CDC." What? Before pregnant women and young children got the shot, privileged university students and employees got it because of connections? Somebody went to Harvard Medical School or whatever elite school with someone else and therefore got access to the vaccine before everyone else?.

7 points  submitted 1 month agoThey combine a great youth sector (argueably the best in Italy), great scouting, a manager that has managed to create a machine that apparently doesn need any individual player to work flawlessly (considering how many great performers have come and gone in the same system) and a few experienced, loyal players that keep the team together. They become a stable presence in the upper half of the Serie A table (if they qualified for EL, which is highly likely, it would be their third consecutive year) despite having very little financial power to hold onto their gems, let alone buy any high profile players.

The sixth staff level review was concluded two days back on February 5 in the same manner.

HSS: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE MODALITIES YOU OFFER POLARITY, MASSAGE, REIKI?Massage. Your body is achy and needs to feel better. Muscles are tight or you need general relaxation. Reiki is a hands on, calming, soothing energy modality that unsticks energy and helps energy flow. Reiki is very relaxing and a session lasts about 30 45 minutes. Reiki puts you in somewhat of a meditative state. Did I mention that its very relaxing?Polarity is Reiki on steroids. use it when people are really stuck (think anger, which often results in chronic headaches/migraines or digestive issues) and can quite work through it. I make every effort to meditate daily for 15 20 minutes.
Bam. Business model.I statements basically means you say "When you/MIL does  x , I feel  y ." instead of saying "You/MIL does  x  and that not okay." So, in the case of your friend, she might say "When MIL talks shit about me, it makes me feel like she doesn respect me or even like me.", "When MIL says all those hurtful things about me, it makes me feel like she wants you to break up with me, or otherwise hurt our relationship.", When MIL starts talking about how I control you or manipulate you, and you don tell her that she wrong and should stop talking like that, it makes me like you agree with her.", "When MIL talks shit about me, and you don tell her off for it, it makes me feel like you care more about letting her have her way than about me not getting hurt."The goal is to put the focus on your own feelings, and how the other person actions affect you. This can also be used against the "But it doesn matter"/"She not gonna stop no matter what I say"/"Just ignore her, everyone does" excuses.

Much much larger than had ever been intended by the founders because what drives the disproportion is changes that were made after the writing of the constitution.Without the college it would be significantly better.

Could have probably done the renovations for $40,000 if no termites were found and I just wanted the place to be "livable" instead of awesome.

I mean you can argue that but at the end of the day kids are always going to be able to access content deemed inappropriate for the context of their time, whether it be playboy magazines or a glimse of a harlot ankle. I remember watching Happy Tree Friends in early primary school as the teacher did not grasp that the internet could be used to look up inappropriate non porn things.

One possible line of reasoning they could try to give for the DM: Imagine they trying to create a boss encounter for the players that occurs in the same situation   same number of encounters since their last long rest, same sense of it being a powerful enemy that they would want to use lots of resources to kill, and it the only enemy the players are facing. How much HP would they expect that enemy to have? If they looked up a monster stat block, and it had that PC HP, would they have taken it seriously as a possible boss, or would they have dismissed it as way too squishy for a major boss monster that the players would fight at full resources?

I think you made smart decisions. One piece of advice I learned in a self defense class is that being on the phone is actually more dangerous than not because it reduces your situational awareness and doesn't provide you with additional security, just a false sense of it. There is very little the person on the other end can do except to hang up and call the police  which if you're lucky would be at least 15 20mins. Situational awareness, a prepared mindset, "strong" body language and the willingness to make a scene are the best deterrents to being attacked.

Imagine that if you were resting on this little body of water from the journal cover and one of those feathers happened to fall on you that it would be quite the experience. There was a time when receiving a feather meant something far worse than an unusual natural history experience. Brief story here is that his grandfather tried to enlist in 1914 but was not accepted because of poor eyesight and also being the father of three girls; but, while out and about in 1916 he was handed a white feather from a woman on the street, a complete stranger that feather at the time being a symbol for cowardice.

Idk who downvoted you, but when she visited she just made her usual excuses about why she too busy to clean up the mess in her house. I never actually met anyone in person I had something like this sort of in common with. When my mom married my step dad he owned this fixer upper house in an upscale neighborhood, but he never ended up fixing it up. From the time I was 8 until I moved in with my dad at 14, the house just slowly fell apart while we lived in it. Like there was these big holes in the kitchen, hallway, and other places that went to the basement, and I fell in several times, like legs waving around in the basement while my torso was still on the ground floor of the house and I had to pull myself out. Plus, my step dad was a low level hoarder so the house was packed with junk and piles of junk and the kitchen in general was just always a mess and everything was cluttered, so it wasnt always easy to avoid these holes. In the winter we didn have heat bc too much of it escaped. And he had a pretty good job, and always kept the exterior of the house looking nice so our neighbors wouldn know. We weren allowed to have anyone over.

The film's greatest success is its heroine, Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain). Although Molly doesn't play a single hand of poker herself, she is the perfect poker protagonist, in that she is, like many professional players, an overachiever with daddy issues.

This narrative is refreshing, considering previous films like Casino Royale are not about our hero winning through their resourcefulness, but through cheating and blind luck.
