What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsMusic and GigsTV GuideTHE Central West Gambling Counselling Service has seen more than 800 clients since it began operation 11 years ago. The service, an activity of Lifeline Central Est Inc., began operation in Bathurst in December 1997 and in May, 1998, extended its operation with an office in Dubbo. The Service is highlighting its presence in the region during Responsible Gambling Awareness Week, which began on Monday . Service co ordinator Kevin Howard said 91 per cent of clients were problem gamblers and, of the problem gamblers seen, 92 per cent had presented with problems with poker machines. "Our statistics show that the breakdown is almost 50:50 male and female," he said. "Throughout NSW, problem gambling counselling services are seeing similar trends, with poker machines creating the majority of problem gambling situations. "We are a specialist service dealing in gambling and associated financial issues and we are available to gamblers and/or their families who are affected by their gambling." A 1999 Federal inquiry showed that, on average, a problem gambler loses $12,000 per year, while other gamblers lose, on average, $625 per year. "During this Responsible Gambling Awareness Week, we are urging all gamblers to take time out, think about your gambling during the week, perhaps take a break and stay in control," Mr Howard said. "If gambling is, or is becoming, a problem, contact someone to talk about it." May 15 2008   10:33PM

It wasn't until the early 19th century that the toothpaste biz as we know it really started heating up.

Tight/Aggressive   You should strive to become this type of player. Tight/aggressive players don't play many hands, but when they do play a hand, it is played very aggressively. They often enter the pot with a raise and will push the action by betting and raising until shown that they are beat. Every time a player bets or raises, it forces other players to make decisions, and whenever players must make a decision, they may make a mistake. Tight/aggressive players capitalize on this tactic by providing opportunities for their opponents to make these mistakes. The name assigned to these players is "Solid." Experienced players usually respect their bets and raises because they seldom enter a pot with a poor hand. Meanwhile, solid players are capable of folding a good hand if they are convinced they are beat. When a solid player is quiet and constantly observing everything at the table while using the advanced strategies discussed before, the name assigned to them is "Professional." A game with too many solid and/or professional players is not a good game to be in.

Levy believes tournament poker   in which competitors pay only a one off buy in fee   is more skill than chance, as opposed to the cash game version where players can continue to pile in more of their hard earned to stay alive.

Poker is a sport because for me, the skill I possess is going to make me a better player than another person   not the luck I get on the day.

This broadside was an appeal to like minded people to contribute to a fund to help relieve thew dire conditions of textile worker strikers in Passaic, New Jersey, in 1926. There were more than 16,000 people involved in this sometimes brutal strike, people who were trying to stay even in their lives, looking for a little more money and a little better working conditions than what they had. The Passiac (a working city just south of Patterson in an industrial triangle section of the state) strikers were moving against a number of textile (wool and silk) mills there, trying to force management to pay them something closer to the $1400 annual income for a family of four to survive.

5 . You will struggle with any engineering workload, UH is no different in this regard. If you don like struggling through material, don do engineering. (Don do any problem solving field in general.) However if you are okay with the struggle you should be fine. Try to form study groups early on in your academic career in engineering because everyone needs help from time to time. Learning from a group, and teaching concepts to your study team will greatly improve your ability to understand the material.

 5 points  submitted 2 days agoWhy are posts that are tweets/content videos from the official teams being removed? I can see an argument if it was in not English w/o subs, but the rest of the content is all great and it's amazing to see more teams doing something this season, so their content should be visible to everyone and not removed because of some rule. Official Team content/tweets etc should be an exception as they are the official pro teams either making a meme about a match, or giving insight to how their team works, no reason any of that should be removed since it's the pro teams you watch play this game. 1 point  submitted 2 days agoNot everything nor am I say everything like you imply. A pro team talking about a match on twitter is on the relevancy scale and a pro team publishing highlights of their voice comms and life leading up to those matches is 100% very relevant as its insight to how a pro league team plays league. If you guys are going to keep nuking posts that are just those things then get rid of the pro team flairs and stop posting match results, otherwise you are having one without the other when you should have both and not having both is being hypocritical. Also so with the initial posts yesterday that got removed that prompted to ask my question they all had different reasons which didn't make sense that weren't relevancy.Edit: an example of how bad it is to remove posts that pertains to the pro teams is it's a like a food and health based sub reddit banning posts about sugar and artificial sugar but allowing posts about candy.

At the basic level Hold 'Em is a high card game where the player is dealt two cards which are known as the 'hole cards'. Five community cards are then dealt face up in three stages   the Flop, the Turn and the River. The idea is for the players to use their two dealt cards and these community cards to make the best possible five card poker hand. There is a small disc on the table which is the dealer button   it represents the position of the theoretical dealer for each hand. When the hand is finished the button gets moved clockwise from player to player. The FlopBefore round one the two players to the left of the button place forced wagers 'blinds' in order to start the pot, with the players immediately left of the button posting a small blind; a bet equal to half the value of the tables lower stake limit; while the player to the left of the small blind places a big blind wager; equal to the full value of the tables lower stake. The blinds are live bets and after they have been placed each player is dealt their two personal cards, the game going clockwise and each player offered the option of raising, folding or calling. Once the first round of betting is done, the first three community cards are dealt (The Flop). The TurnAfter the Flop the player sitting directly left of the button decides on their play, and the game continues clockwise. Players can only check if no bet has yet been made on a round, and the value of wagers begins at the lower level of the stake structure. Once more upper limit bets are used. Each turn of the cards can lead to destruction or glory.

Not everyone needs to be up to date on magic finance, and like anything, if you trying to be frugal and catch deals it does require a degree of attention, which is the case everywhere. If you truly that busy and cannot make time for magic outside of select windows, a format where cards have an expiration date is certainly not right for you, unless the cards were dirt cheap which would only hurt it in other ways..

If I R. Kelly defense attorney and this just came out, I am immediately filing for an injunction excluding any evidence that relates to anything the former counsel said. It all based on a breach of privilege and is similar to a breach of the right to not testify against oneself. There an argument that the prosecutors/police only know to look for certain evidence because of this privilege breach, thus making it fruit of the poisonous tree. I don know what the prosecutor case is, but if I prosecuting, I would be very pissed off because now the whole investigation has this cloud over it. Anything from this point on that uncovered relating to those specific crimes has a chance of being excluded.

A few months ago I realized that in my life a huge part of what will give me purpose is being a good mother, and I'm still a couple years away from feeling comfortable to start that journey, AND I'm not married yet, nor do I feel confident in getting engaged any time soon. However, before I try and even bring up marriage with the person I'm seeing I have to bring up what I've realized to him, and see if he sees that as something that will happen.

I written on exactly that theory before, but I don really track my thoughts because it usually off the cuff spitballing. Anyway, this particular one marries in with what I had above, with KKC showing signs of actually being done as a classical Greek tragedy, where the Tragic Hero has a fatal flaw or hamartia (usually pride) which leads to his downfall, and in which the moment of peripeteia (or reversal) leads the audience to catharsis (which has little to do with our sense of catharsis). So there, I think that Kvothe will go forward seeing himself fully justified in killing the Chandrian even while his ideals increasingly align with theirs and, after he succeeds, he will learn that his success was the actual absolute worst thing he could do and he has damned himself (or whatever the four corners version of damnation is)..

R4: (at 3:29) The creator of this video makes the bold claim that second person pronoun "you" derives from a misspelling by german printing presses of the word "thou/ou" because they did not have the appropriate letter for thorn and had substituted it with "y", hence "ou > you" which "was kept [.] in pronunciation for some reason" (their words). They make reference for "ye" in "ye olde" as an example of this and while this indeed the case for the definite article in "Ye Olde", this is only true for speakers of Modern English due to its anachronistic use in culture and language.

Maybe someone that started these rules didn't have this science or technology to do this in their era and now they're saying "if I didn't have it in my time no one can." Or some Karen that has never played a day of sports in her life.

The sad thing is, Biden a smart guy and the Times readers are smart enough to engage in a real discussion and even defense of the Obama administration chosen path to economic recovery. After all, it is the NY Times columnist Paul Krugman who spends much of his column arguing that too much money was given to the banks and too little to recovery projects that directly benefit the people. If Biden disagrees with economists as respected as Krugman, then let him do so. That what Times readers deserve. Not political pablum served up with a side of propaganda.

Lottery draws are random, so it doesn matter what other people do, right? Wrong. Although psychology can rule the fall of the balls it can determine the size of your windfall. Thanks to our superstitions and customs, certain numbers tend to be more popular choices than others meaning that if they come up, the jackpot is shared among more people. On a standard lottery game where you have to choose 6 numbers between 1 and 49, Poundstone says any of the following numbers will give you a better shot at the full jackpot: 10, 20, 29, 30, 32, 38 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, 49. (Of course, if millions of people read this article, then that advice is moot.)

Ciara GalvinIT was an evening you wouldn't send the dog out in, but off we trekked to the cinema for Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. With the rain pelting outside, we settled into our seats along with the eight other cinema goers and we put on our 3D glasses.I was looking forward to the second cinematic instalment of Frank Miller's graphic novels. The first instalment wasn't everyone's cup of tea, but I thought it was a classic piece of cinema with its clever colour scheme and old Hollywood characters.It moved at a pace with stories interweaving and audiences scrambling to find out more about the characters of the crime riddled Basin City.The first film was a guessing game, characters revealed little and their past lives were a mystery.

It very unlikely that you could do that. In Apex you have to get an item from the corpse of the team mate and if they copy that feature, they will copy it right.

When players make mistakes because something upsets them emotionally, it is called a "tilt" or "being on a tilt." An example is a player who is a huge favorite in a hand but loses to an opponent who hits a miracle card on the river (often called a "bad beat"). That player becomes so emotionally upset that he/she begins to make bad decisions.

As for cleaning, get a five in one painters tool, looks like a funny looking chisel with a curved part on it. The curved part is made to fit over a roller cover and push out any excess paint. Do this back into the 5 gallon, brush all the paint from the bucket back into can. Fill up the five gallon with some water and use the dirty cover as a "brush" to clean out all the paint in the bucket. Once your bucket is clean enough for a final rinse your roller cover should be clean enough for a few minute clean under some water.

The primary reason as to why card games are so fun and have withstood the test of time is that they have game play depth as well as player interaction. This means that though people will most likely be introduced to card games at some point in their lives, they will continue to play those same card games because it offers them stimulation. Card games like klaverjassen are such that they are easy to learn but very difficult to master and therein lays the intriguing part of the whole concept of the card game..

We still have relatively limited knowledge about how pregnancy works and how fetuses develop, and none of the tests catch everything.

This is a long story of its own but to put it simply, North Korea refused low level talks because it sensed that they could get a better deal by one on one talking with Trump himself. The US chief nuclear negotiator Stephen Biegun was only able to begin talks with NK this year after months of NK reluctance   and the resulting prep time was very short. Thus its highly likely that the (relatively) small details such as the formal end to the Korean war, normalising relations, joint excavations etc. were sorted out while the big questions (denuke/sanctions relief) were left blank for the two leaders to figure out at Hanoi. Much was at stake in this summit.

The Underwood House is a small museum about their family. I got to go to one of their family gatherings and learn about their history with Korea and it was really fascinating. Horace H. Underwood and his wife (she is also very important because she was a female doctor so she became the personal doctor for Queen Min, but I can remember her name right now) were closish to the last king and queen of Korea and they were also assassinated by the Japanese. Many of their descendants still live here and you can learn about them at the aforementioned Underwood House.

In a curious irony, gays and lesbians for decades fought for society to legally recognize their sacred promise to "love, honor and cherish" one another forever. Meanwhile, straights cowering from commitment have abandoned that very same legal and spiritual status for which courageous gays and lesbians fought so hard.
It seems more likely to me that OP is lying than (a): a teacher could care so little for a child health and welfare as to expose them repeatedly and intentionally to an allergen that causes a reaction severe enough to be deemed "potentially life threatening," with the issue going completely unaddressed by school admins until such time that a 3rd party lawyer and insurance company (!?!) could weigh in, and (b) the teacher could convince the child, repeatedly, to consume the allergen against their parents wishes and then lie to the parents to insist that the kid took the snack and ran away to consume it before it could be recovered.

And, of course, women can experience a decline in libido without any of these things being involved.

The whole setup to his death is immensely frustrating as hell, as we are given enough false hopes from Makanai and Azee that the members of Tekkadan can secretly get the fuck out of Mars and start a new life with new identities in Chryse.

But at the very least, Kudelia (and Atra) are spared the fate of being gunned down as they make their escape separately from them. As per norm, the show takes its opportunity to steal a free kick to our feels by throwing in the episode preview where Mika decides to ask for Orga opinion as to what to name his potential child.

I began playing online poker on February 2006 and have been doing so ever since.

Although I do not play for the money, I take poker seriously (as every other hobby I have), so I study the game, read a lot of books, analyze my plays, watch the pros play, etc.

Since you using Arcane, I sure you can use Old Hunter Bone (save all uses for after his first phase), it really helps both in dodging his quick combos and then in quickly closing the gap to start attacking him sooner. Also, carry Oil Urns and Fire Paper to the fight, throw an urn when he relatively still, apply fire paper (preferably to a quick weapon) and get ready to dance. He take a lot of extra fire damage, and stagger easier, as long the oil effect and firepaper are active, so make sure to keep reapplying them whenever there an opportunity. All this is easier said than done obviously, remember to stay calm while switching between items, especially in the later phase when you have to keep Old Hunter Bone active too. Good Hunting!

Do you think the pros would become just too nitty if there was not enough cash in the middle preflop?

One of the best things about online poker is it can help you win money more than the amount you can have in real life poker rooms. Online poker, for a fact, is more economical than its real life counterpart. This is because poker sites on the Internet don't really charge people for membership fees. In fact, they even give out bonuses for people who want to register on their site. These bonuses are called sign up bonuses and they can be used to play poker. There are also deposit bonuses where players can have a bonus that would match the amount of their deposit to a certain percentage. With bonuses given by poker sites, players can wager more than their budget and play more games.
