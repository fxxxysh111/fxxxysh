Thoughts? Given this board is so bad for my range, maybe a check is best on the flop, especially since I have the Ks. That way I strengthen my checking range when I have AK. However, I decided to bet because I was OOP. If I was IP, maybe a check would be better. If I do opt to check, then I suppose I call down on most brick runouts. When villain raises he has mainly sets and flush draws. 89s is there also. I also think he can have overpairs that want to protect on this board, but perhaps those would opt to call?

During my time with AppleCare I had a recurring gentleman who liked to have me help him organize his music with Apple Music. His iPhone was an earlier model (5, I think) with like 8GB of storage, so he had limited space. The phone was disconnected from cellular, so he pretty much used it as iPod over wi fi. He needed help downloading and managing his songs, because he would work out in his yard a lot and lose his wifi connection. So each time he called in I would hop in with Screen Sharing and help him offload the music he was tired of and download any newer songs he wanted. Each call totally killed my AHT for the day, but I always liked working with him. He was an upbeat guy in his 50s or 60s, and we would always have a good time talking about music while we were organizing his library. Each call would end with "Thanks, u/GeetarDood, I think I know how to do it now!" and each new call would start with "Hey u/GeetarDood, I remember us doing this thing last time and I can for the life of me remember how to do it again."

Her jungling is slow and inefficient, and the common consensus seems to be that she doesn even begin to become a champion until level 11.Her winrates are as expected in an early game meta   46% winrate in toplane seems to be the best place to "hide" Kayle   Whereas 41 42% In the mid/jungle seem as if she is ineffective there at best.However, her late game ramp is absurd   Once she hits 16, regardless of how many times she has fed or done poorly, she is an unstoppable force and will almost certainly win the game.This makes her feel very bad both to play as, and to play against, because regardless of the Kayle player skill, if you ever hit level 16 and have not won the game against her, you are almost guaranteed to lose, and if you are laning as her, you are a helpless, muling kitten.Will anything be done to make Kayle a little more bearable to lane with, possibly by taking away some of the unstoppable late game power? I feel the champion should feel good to play at all stages of the game, not simply hoping you can "survive until level 11" and rely on your teammates to carry you like an anchor until that point.LeagueOfMeta was quite a different place years ago.

It's not that I don't agree with those things and want them too, but I think it is dangerous to tie them together like this because you politicize climate change and you alienate the right and moderate politicians. Climate change action should transcend politics and this feeds into republicans fears that liberals are just using climate change as an excuse to enact their radical agenda.

Two Pair: Two separate pairs (eg. 4,4,Q,Q). As usual the pair with the higher value is used to determine the winner of a tie. 
Blinds and Antes: Given that the blinds increase as the game proceeds, one must keep in mind that it changes the fraction between what is each round and the average stack size. Therefore, this means that for one to be successful, he or she must be ahead of the blinds. This way it is easier to avoid stack falling away without causing opponents any damage or reaching that final table.

And I just couldn help but think, the reason that we want all these things to change is because we love people and know the good and the beauty that humans are capable of, if every human treats every other human with respect, dignity, and compassion. 
I would argue it was the prefect play. As you stated, we started each set of downs with a run, leading to a whole 1 yard gain the set of downs before. The Pats were probably expecting another run here, which means a pass play would be a great call. Not sure why that play should be questioned, as it still would have burned the clock with a completion and getting tackled inbounds. Again, we need a touchdown here for a better chance of winning. I would take a 20 yard gain that burns clock over a yard or two any day.

Some parts of personality are in fact genetic.

It depends a lot on your personal situation, and what you value. IMO the people with the lowest wages are better off in Canada for many reasons (healthcare being an obvious one), meanwhile people with highly specialized careers are probably better off in the US since they can afford all the crazy prices there AND make way more money. For most of the people in the middle though it is not so clear.

Now, the trick is, you have to place your bet before you see any of the five cards that you'll next receive.

Dennis could, of course, initiate the break regardless   and either accept Button's retirement or gamble that he doesn't really mean it.

Full pay 9 6 machines are most common in Nevada, but they can be found in Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri   indeed, nearly anywhere there is competition for players. Even in Nevada, some casinos offer the 8 5 pay table, sometimes even alternating 9 6 and 8 5 pay tables at the same bank of machines. Be sure to read the pay table before sitting down to play. If you are in an area with several casinos within walking distance, do not settle for a pay table that is below the standard for the area.
After passing "The Baptism Site" (and I mean Jesus, not just any old baptism!), we arrived to the Dead Sea. When we got there (sans guidebook) we had no idea where to stay. It was surprisingly undeveloped, with miles and miles of coastline. You know in the US that would be filled with Mariotts and McDonalds! But we ended up spending one night at the extremely nice Movenpick Hotel. The saddest thing is that we couldn swim in the Dead Sea   it was too cold. Due to the sea being four times as salty as a normal ocean, there are only three types of bacteria that can survive. I wanted to check out the floatability (is that a word? or do I mean bouyancy?) but we could only sit beside it and have the local beer, Amstel, brewed in Jordan! Interestingly, The Dead Sea is the lowest point on earth.

But this is a solid point, and we consider it next time we do this. We committed right now to putting the rules to vote yearly, so there will be another opportunity (and more in the future).Another thing is that the questions should have straight yes or no options without this ranking thing.

Worked at a small Mexican chain in Canada years ago and had a crazy busy day.

No I'm absolutely not in violation of any rules. Stop acting like you know anything about this topic that you just learned about via google. This is my job and I know what I'm allowed to say. Nothing I've said comes anywhere close to violating any rules. And if you disagree, fire up google again and send me some links. Fun fact, military personnel are allowed to identify themselves as being in the military and are allowed to have political opinions. Another fun fact: we're considered citizens, are allowed to vote, and don't have to be silent robots. Fuck off.

Although children may enjoy this one as much as the others (the lighter tone, in fact, may make it the favorite), adults are likely to find it less absorbing. The time has come to let the dragon training end. On the other hand, the lack of a genuine ending leaves the narrative unfinished and results in a sense of disappointment when the end credits roll. 
It also didn take 8 searches, that of course would be insane. Right after the car was found, they did a 10 minute sweep of the trailer to see if Teresa was alive anywhere (entry 1). Obviously they would not see a key tucked in a bookcase on this "search".

Even if you ask Korea to reduce Seoul API by half (which is unrealistic for such a densely populated megacity), that still AQI around 150s which is 5x over the safe range. Living with AQI around 100s is a hell of a lot better than Seoul constantly breaking 200s.

I myself had only scant notions of what massage is about when I embarked this month on a quest to experience as many major modalities as possible.

Does that mean that wrestling is fake? It's true that the plots are predetermined and the moves are choreographed. Wrestlers aren't really trying to beat up and injure each other. Sometimes, the bitterest enemies in the ring are really best friends, and the outlandish stories surrounding the characters are usually not true.

When you see a movie, you know that the actor didn't really jump a burning car over an exploding bridge, but you're still entertained. Stunt people and special effects crews worked to make those scenes seem real, and their work can be very impressive.

I also have swollen penis story, not as bad as that. First off had sex with the now ex wife. Must of been going at harder than normal cause after cleaning ourselves up, my dick is starting to look larger than normal (was still hard). I start feeling impressed with myself. The ex wife even notices saying why is it getting so big? Like bigger than a big bratwurst. But as I getting soft it starts staying bigger in only the shaft part near the tip. It starts getting scary, we go to the hospital. While waiting I go to the bathroom to check it out again, it worse looking but doesn hurt. After getting examined by the Dr, he says it nothing serious even though it looks like it is. Happens alot apparently. So I very relieved and start cracking jokes and get the Dr rolling. Made a comment about my dick basically having a lions main going on. The Dr is in tears laughing. The swelling goes away and I back to normal sizes.
