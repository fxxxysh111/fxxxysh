TEDx talks, however, represent something of the 'ber three minute thesis test' in the sense that not only must you tackle a big issue but you must also do so in a way that is sophisticated yet accessible, entertaining but serious and thought provoking but not ridiculous.

Metal detectors can penetrate the earth and detect an object down to about one foot under the surface. Just how far each machine can penetrate is determined by the type of metal or mineral you are trying to locate, the size and density of the target, the composition of the soil and the quality of the detector. Soil which contains a high concentration of minerals can cause interference and will reduce depth penetration.

One of the two remaining players can operate as the "banker", and play in a way that funnels money from themselves and another player to the third player.

This was by far the biggest downswing I had ever been on. The sad part is I was probably nearly breakeven (maybe up?) on my own action, I just got absolutely wrecked taking action in other players.

I should also mention family trees. Many families in Europe still have quite old family trees, which can be found in musty tomes in grandfathers library, if you allow the sentimentalities. The records these family trees are based on are usually church records. The churches kept marriages, deaths, births, etc archived for centuries, even in smaller parishes. Only large conflagrations destroyed these archives. This can be floods or fires in the respective churches. But there are essentially two events that form kind of event horizons, where records before this time become markedly rarer. These are the 30 year war (and the preceding interreligious violence) and the black plague of the 14th century. To have family records older than these two events is very, very rare and few families even manage to trace their lineage back any further then the time of the 30 year war. Whereas records dating back to the second half the of the 17th century are comparatively more common.

I just got a desktop pc from the midnight yard sale (bulk trash collection). An i5 3550 with a p8z77 v lk motherboard in an Antec P182 Gun Metal Computer Case. It didn have any ram, graphics card, hard drive, or power supply. But luckily I had the ram for it on hand, as well as an ssd, and a 750w power supply, for which needed to add an 8 pin cpu power cable. It runs pretty ok, and I have been using it to play quake live, mostly because my ASUS PB287Q only supports 30hz refresh rate with hdmi (my laptop doesn have displayport), but the onboard graphics on the mobo play QL just fine.

My understanding is that the visible light spectrum is somewhere around 400 800nm like you said but the sun also puts off infrared light which extends well past that, up in the hundreds of thousands of nm  but the higher the wavelength in nm it drops off quite a bit like is shown at this link:Near infrared light is contained within the spectrum of natural sunlight. In fact, sunlight that reaches the earth's surface contains 52% to 55% near infrared light. It's clear that humans and other animal and plant species, by Nature's design, have been programmed to utilize near infrared light to our benefit.

Yes. In humans this prion induced disease is called Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, in sheep it called scrape (pronounced "scrape ee" because they were found to scrape themselves against fences as they became more demented). Cows fed feed from infected cows get "mad cow" disease (remember the 1990 incidents in Europe). There has been clear human to human transmission in Papua New Guinea from a cannibalistic tribe, called Kuru. They did consume brain tissue (mostly the males) and developed progressive dementia (spongiform encephalopathy, brains looked like sponges, as with all prion disease endpoints.) These all features prions (misfolded proteins) as the main pathogenic source.

Also if you playing pocket fours pre, it kind hard to justify backing away from a set of fours on a six high board. If he didn shove first, which he probably did, since he not button, I guess a monster fold could be rationalized on the grounds that "if my opponent is shoving this board the conditional probability of a set of sixes or straight is high", but even then, set of deuces or overpair is also possible (even assuming nobody is going to shove bluff when they started the hand with thirty big blinds).

Generally the rules are the same for Free Poker and the real Poker Games played at the Live Casinos. It's your job to get a thorough understanding of these rules before you start playing, but since playing is free you can afford to do some learning as you go along.
