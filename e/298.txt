Yes, totally. I didn find out the gender for any of my 3 kids, partly because it wasn like I was going to paint the nursery pink with ASHLEY emblazoned on the walls and a full 2 year wardrobe already washed and hanging in the closet. I went to the hospital to have my first with a couple packs of white onesies and gender neutral sleepers at home, plus a pack n play, a baby carrier that I desperately wanted and gotten on rare sale, and my family hand me down snap n go. That was it. My mother went to Target the day after the baby was born, and all was well. Plus the surprise in the delivery room is LOADS OF FUN. I highly recommend it.

Otto had the diary typed up, though he shifted a few entries and omitted sections that were critical of her mother and of Fritz Pfeffer, as well as certain entries that included Anne's musings on her emerging sexuality. It proved difficult to find a publisher until one of Otto's friends showed it to the historian Jan Romein, who wrote a front page article with the headline "Kinderstem" ("A Child's Voice") for the April 3, 1946, edition of the newspaper Het Parool. "To me, however, this apparently inconsequential diary by a child," Romein wrote, "stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at Nuremberg put together." Soon after, the Amsterdam publisher Contact agreed to publish the book, and on June 25, 1947, it appeared as Het Achterhuis (The Secret Annex).

Everyday circumstances can restrict blood flow: when feet get cold outdoors or in cold water; when shoes, stockings, or undergarments are too tight; even when you've sat too long with your legs crossed. Smoking reduces circulation to all parts of the body, as does drinking too much coffee or caffeinated soda (both nicotine and caffeine constrict blood vessels). And if you are under severe stress, your nerves can constrict your small blood vessels, lessening their ability to carry blood.

Worse, OP has a chemo port. She doesn even have to hit a vein. I agree with one of the comments in the OP, it sounds like she doesn actually know how to access a chemo port, which is astounding for an infusion nurse. She never got blood return.

So I think that nurse has the perfect storm of incompetence and negligence to kill a patient if someone doesn intervene.

Then, in the early 1900s, a French couple purchased the head from an auction house.

I totally agree with you. The position of power that priests have attracts people who want to use that position of power. The original comment insinuates that anybody deprived of sex will start to feel attracted towards young boys or girls which is not only false but quite a disturbing view on sexual nature altogether. Priests have the backing of God and sadly there are even cases where parents have found out about sexual misconduct towards their children and will still take the side of the church through their blind following of faith. Original commenter needs to take a look at their view on sexual nature as this almost seems to remove some of the blame from those who abuse by making it seem that they are normal people caught I a bad situation rather than predators who seek a position of power with forethought and malice

The two routes that receivers can elaborate on are the central and the peripheral routes.

I remember once being stopped by two Italian police patrol cars in the dead of night when well over the limit. Instead of them breathalysing me, we started to have a discussion about the Mussolini biography I had written. 'Mussolini was a very misunderstood man,' I assured the Italian police.

A final attempt at a normal conversation was made. I gathered myself enough to as if I could just spell the word. This call should have taken about 10 minutes at most.

Where Did They Come From?Crocs started life at sea as a deck shoe   hence the holes and the non slip soles. Their genesis is a business fairytale: in July, 2002 three men on a Caribbean sailing trip fantasised about a pair of shoes that was slip proof, waterproof, comfortable, fun, smell free and didn't leave marks. So they decided to make them. Following their initial success with boat users, Crocs were adopted by hospital workers because they could be easily sterilised, and by those in the catering industry and other professions who were on their feet all day because of their comfort. Crocs' rise to fame was somewhat meteoric, relying as it did on word of mouth alone in the early days. By 2007 they were a fashion craze and their presence on the high street became ubiquitous.

Unpopular for maybe half of the internet at least   US healthcare is no where near as bad as it is made out to be in terms of access etc, in fact I think I prefer the idea that those who can afford it get it privately, the other half of the country gets it fully/partly subsidised, and then you have a few who don want it and so shouldn be forced. Now that changed to some extent in the last few years but the idea was ok, it mainly the politics   by which I mean a certain party who keep trying to fuck it up particularly on a state level, but in a good faith approach it could have worked a lot better and is largely fine anyway.

When reviewing chips, be sure to pay close attention to the edges. Poker chips are often tapped, hit together, and are exposed to a lot of harsh treatment. It is important to know that your investment will not be damaged by these types of activities. You will want to watch for cracking, splitting, and even indentions. If you find that your poker chips, or the chips that you are testing out show any of these indicators of damage, it is quite likely that they are not casino quality poker chips. You will want to either move on to another type, or possibly even a better source for your gaming supplies.

In fact, the real world effects of the federal government spending more than 50% of all tax dollars on defense and defense related industries, not just in VT but everywhere, is that the US government must engage in constant and permanent war to defend such expenditures.

These games only accept very low 'bets' and is also good for those who need to practice while having the chance to earn cash (even if small) at the same time.

One guy, Meki, who had a restaurant, and his Dutch friend Edmund decided to go with us on a day trip to a town called Kalkan. Of course Meki had a friend who had a restaurant there and his cousin had a disco there, so we were hooked up in that town! We went to a restaurant in the mountains where you picked out your own trout from a stream, they caught it and grilled it for you.

In fact it has traveled back to our homes from where it supposedly originated. 
At the most basic level that would involve marking nouns, adjectives and verbs that are part of a subclause. So say  X was a suffix denoting that a verb or noun was part of a subclause, that would give us something like "He said he X liked X me X".

When it comes to food, the concept of authenticity is a misnomer. Late last year, American chef Andrew Zimmern purported to be "saving the souls of all the people from having to dine at these horseshit restaurants masquerading as Chinese food" with his Minneapolis restaurant Lucky Cricket. Diners also actively perpetuate the myth of "real" versus "fake," and assign value accordingly. As a recent study revealed, there's a negative correlation between Yelp star ratings and reviewers' use of the word "authenticity." It seems guests and restaurateurs alike are in misguided pursuit of what they deem to be the genuine article, to the detriment of the very real people behind the food they belittle.
Years later, I found a parcel on my front porch, of an expensive book I always wanted, a bottle of Jager, and a love letter from him, begging me to tell him what went wrong between us (even though I had very very very clearly told him a week prior to the drunken night   and incidentally, the day after I broke up with my bf   that I didn like him that way). It made me want to scream. 
When someone binge drinks on weekends they may have some shakiness and anxiety on Monday (I sure many of us have experienced this), but the brain typically has enough time to recalibrate throughout the week and never fully adjusts to relying on alcohol to maintain its neurochemical balance.. 
I believe that the show has very consistent themes, that come together to present a very solid and well thought out idea, I implore you to further consider the point of the symbolism. I don believe that "Standing on it own two feet" means anything important, as symbols and metaphors are the driving force behind the show. Without the metaphors and symbolism there would be nothing left. That being said I can understand the dislike for the marketing on top of it, the characters are fairly dull and episodes 4 and 6 are subpar. It may be fair to judge a book based on it cover, but you might never end up learning what inside.

Booking Agent After managing clients moved from the appointment book to computer software, the skills required for working behind the front desk increased. A spa's booking process resembles that of a hotel front desk. The spa coordinator oversees appointments which are linked to stations and massage rooms   similar to hotel accommodations. Spa coordinators must be computer savvy to manage client email lists, social media and online bookings. The practice of "prebooking," booking clients for future appointments, has become critical to spa profits.

This seller was ready to sell now and wanted to roll the proceeds as a 1031 exchange to a property in his hometown of Virginia Beach (where he was currently living). He said make an offer. I asked for some of his financials and told him again I could offer $205k for it. The next day he texted me and said "When can you close" I swear I could have fallen out of my chair. NO COUNTER? NO "YOUR CRAZY"? Did I offer too much? My head was spinning. LESSON 7 Fellow Newbies: Play poker because in this business you need to have a poker face. I clarified and told him its $205 and he pays closing costs, trying to get as much out of this deal as I could. He said he had an offer at 200k cash with no closing costs. I've seen his bluff before. So I offered him $207,500 and he pays $7500 in closing costs. 3 days later he texts me back and says yes he'll do the deal. I'm on a trip to Charleston SC eating breakfast with my family and I about lose it over the fact that I have an agreement on an off market deal on a quad plex via text message. As soon as I got back home I called a bunch of banks to try to see how on God's green earth I could use my VA loan again to move into that property, so I could move into this property with nothing down.
First, have you spent any time working in a law firm, or for any lawyers that do the kind of law you might want to practice? If not, don even think about going to law school before doing that. Why? Because the idea of being a lawyer is great, but the reality of being a lawyer fucking sucks and you need to find that out before you spend $150k on an education.

The Hidden World focuses on Hiccup's continuing coming of age story as he evolves beyond thinking of himself as being defined by his dragon. Helping him through this crisis of confidence are his girlfriend and potential future wife, Astrid (America Ferrera), and his mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett). He also learns that part of growing up is learning to let go and, to put that lesson to the test, he has to give Toothless his freedom so the dragon can pursue his own destiny (which might include making little Night Furies with the white female). All of this happens against the backdrop of Grimmel's bloodthirsty quest to eliminate all creatures that aren't like him. ("He doesn't believe in himself without his dragon. Help him out with that.") It's as if he doesn't trust his audience to "get" things without having them verbalized   an underestimation of many children, who are intuitive and can pick up on subtle cues.

In most countries the political class have for some time been running things in a manner totally contradictory to what the public desires. It seems most of you fear that direct democracy will enable populism but really it will kill populism, which is a result of large segments of society being politically excluded and compounded by the populists having no responsibility for anything. In Switzerland people have ownership in the system and are used to taking responsibility for their countries political affairs, and that why they vote for fiscally sensible budgets and don just demand to raise taxes on the rich to 140% and execute unpopular celebrities or something..

If you ask me that "If Alter Egos aren to be implemented in CCC rerun, then who they are?", my answer is would be Rani VIII or Hakuno Kishinami.

The Clayton Act was passed the same year, addressing specific practices the Sherman Act does not prohibit.

My experience over the last 5+ years in business is that there are people who want to own their own business but not willing to put the work into it, so all they do is talk about it.

When you play online Texas Hold'Em poker you do not get to see your opponents face to face. This means that you cannot pick up on their "tells", you cannot read them.

I know an extremely prominent plastic surgeon in a Northern city filled with a lot of extremely prominent plastic surgeons. She too is ridiculously wealthy, tall, beautiful, and a racist. I must have accidentally gotten on her private email list (perhaps I gave her a card at a conference while researching my book on cosmetic surgery). She sends out regular missives about fighting the Democrats. In her latest one, she compares Nancy Pelosi to a dictator, a despot, and a Queen. Why? Because of Pelosi support of the Obama healthcare agenda, an agenda that the plastic surgeon has also compared to the Nazi Final Solution.

Joking aside, I don think it too hard to identify fish/bad players. Just pay attention to the kinds of hands they show up with, and think about how they showed up with those hands. What must have been their thought process? (Usually, there is no thought process.) The exploitable fish are those whose ranges are too wide or tight, and whose aggression factor is too high or too passive. At the most basic, don bluff the loose players. Don hero call the tight players. Be a little more willing to do vice versa.

By contrast, Granadinos (modern Colombia) were not as rich, and were more affected by distance and terrain. Bogota was practically isolated from other major cities, and slavery was not as important, being simply used for mines rather than big plantations. Indigenous people and their tribute weren as prominent, while the Church exercised greater power. Most people were small farmers who cultivated wheat and maize in the template valleys. But there was a core of Colonial bureaucrats and learned men who provided leadership and greatly influenced the development of the war and independence.
He didn Personally I think he just put her body in the car as a place to keep it until it was dark and he could get the fire going, rather than leaving her in the middle of the garage bleeding.

I genuinely wondering what you mean by both sides need to come to a solution. Trump made it clear that he wants wall funding as a response to perceived boarder security issues. Dem have stated that they will fund boarder security, but not a wall. It seems like the Dem are coming to the table with options, Trump is the one that is stuck on a very specific non negotiable item. It feels like the only real solution here is for Dem and Republicans to come to an agreement that they are both happy with and to override Trump veto power. Do you see some other solution that nobody else does?.
