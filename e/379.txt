The whole reason I got angry about this in the first place is because this whole thread is full of people complaining about putting frozen meals into the microwave and them coming out frozen. If you insisting that the instructions always make it come out just right, are you implying that all of these people are just ignoring the instructions? In that case my anger is just pointed at people who dont follow instructions then, excuse me for thinking people wouldn just be winging their fucking food..

Das Wissen dieser Wechselbeziehungen und ihrer Erscheinungsformen ist fr jeden Menschen von Interesse, fr den Kranken, wie auch Gesunden und insbesondere fr den Arzt jeder beliebigen medizinischen Spezialisierung. Die Autoritt der Medizin ist in der ganzen Welt zum heutigen Tag bedeutend gesunken.

No worries, I be a pest before dishing out $100/month too. TBH I didn know what I was expecting. I just knew the amount of content that RIO had and the quality of the pros. I am primarily a heads up player so I watched a lot of Sauce123 and Krab videos and just listening to their thought process was helpful. There was one video where Sauce123 analyzes a 6x shove on the river by OTB_RedBaron and it really got me thinking outside my normal level. They also do a bunch of PIO work so its helpful to see what ranges they assume when running sims and how they simplify a ton of information to make it fit into an overall playable strategy. If you don know where to start, I recommend filtering the elite videos by popularity and working your way down (you can further filter to narrow it down to only the game type you want to study).

One reporter brought up the interesting point that "there a responsibility for countries to take these people back and that they . stand trial and face justice in their own countries because . it could be a national security threat to actually leave them in these camps where they could be radicalized and, you know, left to languish with a very uncertain future." essentially, though isis is on the verge of defeat, leaving these people for dead instead of repatriating them and having them stand trial can be viewed as setting ripe conditions for more extremist islamic activity. repatriating these women and imprisoning them is an option worth considering as opposed to just repatriating them with a slap on the wrist.

Most no limit ring games have a set buy in (for instance, $200) or a range of buy ins (for instance, your buy in might be for any amount between $200 and $400). Of course, if you lose all of your chips, you can buy back in. The games have a blind structure and minimum betting structure just like regular limit games. A game may be called $200, 1/2 no limit, which means that the buy in is $200, the blinds are .50 and $1, and the minimum bet the first two rounds is $1 and the last two rounds is $2.

What makes the Speed3 tick is the now famous MZR DISI turbocharged 2.3L inline 4 cylinder. This same powerplant saw service in the Mazdaspeed6 and is currently used in the CX 7.

One of the simple benefits of universal basic income programs, and their appeal to some small government proponents, is that they are by definition not means tested, and allow for the consolidation of a huge number of benefits programs which are now administered separately. So besides cutting out the administrative overhead of means testing, consolidating benefits programs into a universal basic income also eliminates redundant/duplicate administrative expense of the dozen or so major Federal (and some State) benefit programs already in place..

Just kinda lightly venting to you all, but my buddy who has recently won more than usual the past few nights he has played has shifted gears and now believes he is a serious and skilled poker player. He talks like his 3x bet with AA and KK was this genius play or his call with AQhh on a KJ9hhx board was amazing. These pots are surely worth a recall, but the analysis/story he puts into them is a bit over the top for me..

As far as food goes, well, there are MacDonalds everywhere I would obviously steer clear of most local joints, but there are plenty of western food outlets, a lot of them tend to be pizza hut or some other western delicacy though! They tend not to be in to Italian food or the like, as you'd imagine. It's a big city, so you'll find somewhere that looks safe enough to eat, but it may take some searching, depending on where you stay.

And further, while they might have been in the minority, and it is clear enough that practical concerns gave most of Latin America little reason for anything other than support of the Union, it can be said that the support was immediate. In the first phase of the war, much of the press in South America was in fact not pro Union, as the papers were heavily dependent on British/French dispatches, which were often quite sympathetic to the Confederacy.

Edit: The most difficult parts of grooming them are cleaning their claws and their ears. They tend to get buildup in their ears over time that should be cleaned out. Still, I estimate that it only takes 10 15 minutes to do a full bath + claws + ears.We also keep their nails trimmed more often than we would a normal cat, since they can accidentally scratch themselves (or each other) due to the lack of furry armor.You can also clean them with coconut oil, if a full water bath is undesirable at the moment   plus, it great for their skin!chive_machine  4 points  submitted 2 years agoBathing tends to happen between once a week and once a month   in the dryer months, they seem to get less oil buildup on their skin, so they both need to be bathed less and are more prone to having dry skin issues if bathed too often.Sphynx vary pretty significantly on how much fur they have   there are some cats that have basically none (and their skin can feel kind of tacky to the touch), and there are some cats (particularly recent descendants of outcrosses) that are almost fully furred (although those can be shown).

And DNA creates proteins that activate other parts of your DNA. So the "build an eyeball" section of DNA is expressed and your ribosomes build a protein from that "build and eyeball DNA" but that protein doesn actually build anything. Your eyeball isn one thing, it many things. So that protein instead turns on other parts of your DNA, like the "build a retina DNA". That DNA turns on a protein that tells nearby stem cells to become nerve cells or rod cells or cone cells. The "Build an eyeball protein" also activates "Build a lens" DNA and "make collagen" DNA and "build an iris" DNA, and that "Build an iris" DNA, via proteins, turns on the "Become muscle cells" DNA and "Become epithelial cells" DNA etc. of nearby stem cells.

Analyzing each real estate expert evidence in detail, Justice Mesbur determined that she was unable to accept either expert opinion, adding, with some frustration, I recognize the valuation is an art, not a science, I would have expected the ultimate opinions to have been much closer to one another.

She determined that the home was valued at $15,500,000 at the date of separation..

Orthopedists are useless in spine and disk problems as they understand the bone aspects, but not the neurological complexities. A general doctor just doesn't have the expertise required to treat this. The reason you need to report it is that if you're having tingling/numbness in your fingers (especially if it's creeping its way from the tips to the knuckles) the disk inflammation isn't getting any better and the pressure is enough that it's starting to cut off the nerve impulses to your hand.

Why does this happen? "Against only one randomly chosen pair of hole cards, there is a substantial chance that the sixes won't need to improve; likewise the ace can often come out on top just by itself, so the Ace 7 is second best," Sean explained.

I read a parenting book that said that there are two kinds of friends: face to face and shoulder to shoulder.

We study a very small three player poker game (one third street Kuhn poker), and a simplified version of the game that is interesting because it has three distinct equilibrium solutions. For one third street Kuhn poker, we are able to find all of the equilibrium solutions analytically. For large enough pot size, P, there is a degree of freedom in the solution that allows one player to transfer profit between the other two players without changing their own profit. This has potentially interesting consequences in repeated play of the game. We also show that in a simplified version of the game with P>5, there is one equilibrium solution if 5P . This may be the simplest non trivial multiplayer poker game with more than one distinct equilibrium solution and provides us with a test case for theories of dynamic strategy adjustment over multiple realisations of the game.We then study a third order system of ordinary differential equations that models the dynamics of three players who try to maximise their expectation by continuously varying their betting frequencies. We find that the dynamics of this system are oscillatory, with two distinct types of solution. We then study a difference equation model, based on repeated play of the game, in which each player continually updates their estimates of the other players' betting frequencies. We find that the dynamics are noisy, but basically oscillatory for short enough estimation periods and slow enough frequency adjustments, but that the dynamics can be very different for other parameter values.

PokerStars has been a driving and highly controversial player in the battle over poker in California. Supporters believe that its inclusion will help create the maximum amount of revenue. However, opponents say PokerStars is so big (reports indicate it controls anywhere from 70 to 95 percent of the world online poker market) that no other sites in California would be able to compete. Along with the desire of race tracks, including Del Mar, to launch a poker site, the debate over whether to allow PokerStars in California is the biggest hurdle for California to clear. That's why lawmakers and stakeholders here are watching New Jersey so carefully.

In college, I was working in a group project with an international student from China.

From my perspective, I not there to judge you. I there to judge the suitability of your home for the dog you want to adopt. I wouldn worry about the crate and all that now (unless you want to) but I would definitely tell them where you plan to put the crate when they do the walkthrough, that way they can let you know if it a good or bad area.

My advice for having a conversation with her, based on my own recovery from an eating disorder and having to have this conversation with other people struggling, is to be open and honest, but prioritize her feelings and seek to understand first. I'd ask general questions first,  how is life going, how is school going, how is she feeling in general. Then you can get into "are you worried about your diet or weight?" Avoid doing this in the middle of her doing something you think is concerning, find a time outside of exercise/meal times. It's okay to express your concern about her. Just don't dismiss. "But you're X" comments, whether X is "already skinny," "beautiful," "don't look like you have an eating disorder," etc. are where you will go most wrong.

I would, and am currently doing research to choose one. Furthermore, we should all probably consider it. 80% of the human population eats insects as a regular part of their diet Source. So the answer to who does it is most people eat bugs, just maybe not through a protein shake. Even the minority of us who don purposely eat insects are consuming a lot of insects that are allowable within our food production.
While some states, like Texas, do not require that you have liability insurance, it is something you should strongly consider, since anyone who believes your work has caused them physical distress may be inclined to sue you, whether their case is with merit or not.

The calcifediol levels were measured again 25 weeks after the start of the supplementation, at which time treatment was discontinued, and after a further 24 weeks without supplementation.Twenty four weeks after supplementation was stopped, a marked reduction in the level of perceived pain occurred in the treatment group.Between the first and the 25th week on supplementation, the treatment group improved significantly on a scale of physical role functioning, while the placebo group remained unchanged.The treatment group also scored significantly better on a Fibromalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) on the question of "morning fatigue." However, there were no significant alterations in depression or anxiety symptoms."We believe that the data presented in the present study are promising. FMS is a very extensive symptom complex that cannot be explained by a vitamin D deficiency alone."However, vitamin D supplementation may be regarded as a relatively safe and economical treatment for FMS patients and an extremely cost effective alternative or adjunct to expensive pharmacological treatment as well as physical, behavioral, and multimodal therapies," said Wepner."Vitamin D levels should be monitored regularly in FMS patients, especially in the winter season, and raised appropriately.". 
If someone has a rainbow mohawk, that one thing, but blonde is still a natural colour, and if someone thinks they look better as a blonde, I don think they should feel the need to change it just because some study said men think brunettes are better to marry. Until it comes out that men are actively refusing to date or marry someone who dyed their hair blonde, this advice seems really over the top..

Regarding Doc's skills, he had quite a number of them. Bluff, Sense Motive, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Linguistics, and Profession (Gambler) are no brainers. If you still have points left, then you might find Intimidate, Knowledge (Local), and Knowledge (Nobility) useful. Disguise isn't out of the question either, as Doc went on the run from the law several times, and assumed false names and appearances while he was doing so.

Larsen endorses the idea of the festival being pared down, to focus on a few events such as coffin races, frozen turkey bowling and a polar plunge, and "getting away from the heavy drinking" that has characterized it in recent years. He also favors a pivot from its for profit status to its being a nonprofit affair, potentially benefiting a local interest such as the Wild Bear Nature Center, Teens Inc., or the Peak to Peak Music Education Association..

Bernard's last rock of the game, an open takeout, caught her team by surprise when it failed to curl   "She was right at the stick," said O'Connor   and pushed the Swedish stone into another rock at the back of the rings, and Norberg made a hit to force the extra end.Rest assured, there will be no fingers pointed at Bernard."Cheryl is the reason we're sitting up here now, she's the reason that we're at the Olympics," said O'Connor. 
The title of my talk is 'The Problem with Democracy'. However, the problem with even talking about 'the problem with democracy' is that it is a loaded statement. Loaded in the sense that it suggests that (1) there is a single 'problem' when it might be argued a discussion of 'the problems' [plural] with democracy might offer a more rounded and sophisticated set of answers; and (2) loaded in the sense that it accepts that 'a problem' exists. I want to take on and challenge each of these assumptions in turn but before this I want to make the rather unfashionable   even heretical   suggestion [and this is my 'hook'] that one of the problems with contemporary democracy might be that in some parts of the world we have too much democracy rather than too little. Let's call this problem 'hyper democracy'.

Probably the best way to speed it up is better familiarity with all the cards and core strategies. Everyone knowing what they should aim towards instead of being faced with so many different options and not knowing how this will affect the rest of their game, should speed up turn times a lot.

But I think the real lessons are far more complicated than that. People who are motivated by hate do not stop hating because one of their heroes is suddenly revealed to be less than perfectly hateful. Listen, I oppose crazy, right wing homophobes as much as the next person, but I can help think that perhaps their personal lives are not the point? Perhaps no politician personal life is the point?.

No, John Doe wasn't originally a serial killing Hawkman, no matter how much better the movie clearly would have been; we mean his presence had to be largely atmospheric. So Fincher hired designer John Sable to "crazy that bitch up." And crazy a bitch up he did: Sable spent $15,000 on old journals, ripped them up and sewed them back together by hand, then baked them to release that delicious tattered journal flavor. Sable found as many pictures of "mutilated limbs, decapitated people, [and] people whose fingers had been sawn off" as he could, and then he started writing like a maniac.

The company job is to deliver goods with the highest inflow (more orders) and lowest costs. Period. Doing the math and understanding the laws they don tell their drivers to break the law and kill people, but they might very well overwork them to the edge of the profit Los curve on settlements and liabilities and often do. The drivers have a totally different motivation. They understand the math and the laws so the get there as fast as possible by skirting the edge of the speed limits etc. Sure, liability laws should likely be stronger, but you are fighting the nature of the beast. Use the profit motive when it appropriate. There is a limited supply of healthcare and an unlimited demand for health. The free market doesn have a place in that kind of scenariowe have a small food processor, might hold 2 cups of anything, total.

His career has changed significantly, with new challenges and accomolishments, my day is still cooking and cleaning and taking care of kids.
