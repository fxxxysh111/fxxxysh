They had already started jamming together and had floated the idea of starting a band when one of them said (no one remembers who), "10,000 Maniacs? What a great band name." And there was basically a moment of, "are we doing this? Let do this." This was not entirely true, however.

When we make decisions we regret, it influences our future brain activity, especially in the medial orbitofrontal region, the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, the areas responsible for emotions and emotion related memories in the brain. High stakes decisions increase the activity in these regions, ramping up emotional stress and clouding our attempts at clear headed thinking. Take this example: It's easier to play a high stakes game of poker if you pretend you're gambling for matchsticks instead of recognizing that the chips on the table represent a million dollars.

He also said he "blacked out" during the actual assault."He said he comes back to (consciousness) and he's standing over her," Shatek said.

High endurance athletes actually are at more risk for CVA.Only partially true. Endurance athletes do have higher CAC scores than non athletes, but their mortality is still lower than non athletes. Including lower CVD related deaths. Athletes have fairly stable plaques instead of the unstable mix of calcium and lipids seen in unhealthy people, and stable plaques don rupture as easily and cause heart attacks.In the case of endurance athletes, the hardening and thickening of arteries is most likely a natural process and not really a "disease."Interestingly though they categorized them as either 3000+METmin/wk or less than 1500METmin/wk so if I understand that correctly it means high activity (not necessarily endurance athletes just self reported as highly active) versus not so active (including all the way down to no exercise per week). Seems like it shows a trend that very active people had more calcifications in general but better health outcomes than those that were less (or not at all) active.I thought we already knew that any exercise is better than none or almost none for overall health outcomes.It be more interesting to compare highly active to moderately active by increasing the lower threshold. Compare in brackets rather than lot and or less may have misunderstood though I just woke up /:

There are several companies that helped Hitler build his war machine, such as Porsche and Maybach. Were these companies ever assigned blame or did they ever address that fact? It seems funny to me that these companies are successful to this day yet they seem to have a dark spot in history.

What's the lesson? It could be that attendees crave more wide ranging discussions about timely topics. At the main stage CMOs from Ancestry, eBay and Cigna largely talked about their own campaigns. No one with a CMO title spoke on the second stage, where the line up included Ramsey simply riffing on eMarketer reports about topics including voice search and advertising trends for over the top and connected TVs. Kawaja's talk was actually called "Fire your CMO: Marketing's Future Will Not Resemble its Past," which he used to describe why traditional brands are falling behind direct to consumer startups like Airbnb and mattress seller Casper. Paskalis did not give a formal presentation; he just fielded questions from ANA executive Bill Duggan, including about how the bank hired a "brand safety officer" to help keep the bank's ads away from questionable online content.

What is the major divergence in this type of game and the multi table game? This style of tournament is more similar to a Final table, while in the Multi Table surroundings if a player goes their position can be replaced by another player. So just like a final table anyone from another table, with a much larger get, will not be moving to your table. In every other way your moves must be the same as your poker strategy dictates, which should look at your stack, your position, and players, and of course your cards. Tight play in early position and loose later is the best play, so prevent what many do, which is to play very loose early when little is at risk, and then play tighter when you could be in the money.
And as for Duel, I think keeping the card effect is alright, because it the logical ultimate form of red soft removal, but it should not cost 2 mana and make Black, the best color at single target removal, wish it could have a card as insane as Duel.

The game of poker is by far the most popular form of card playing worldwide. In fact, there are so many different ways to play poker that it can practically entertain its own category in card playing. Poker style games can be tracked back as far as ten centuries from similar games which contained poker like rules and the use of bluffing as part of a method for success. The most popular history assumption of poker is that it was originated by Chinese around 950AD which they called "domino cards". This of course was not the same game you see today or any of its variations for the matter. Most all early variations of poker where similar in many ways and then were enhanced and mixed into what many of play today.

Xi doesn need to worry about elections and their control of the media will make it so they can convince the citizens that their problems are because of the US and not the communist government.Meanwhile, they called Trump bluff about increasing the tariffs. He doesn want to do it because it will increase prices for consumers.Look at how many revolutions have been started because of increases to gasoline or food prices? I don expect revolution but it could could cost Trump the election and he knows it.So we either get stalemate or they agree to go back to where we were before the tariffs and both sides declare victory. The latter is what happened with NAFTA.

Bissonnette said she and the staff regularly encountered people who arrived with no hope to live and watched them convalesce.

Because 2 times 14 is 28, which is a little less than 33, and 3 times 14 equals 42, you know the number is closer to two than three, or your odds of winning are closer to 2 to 1 than 3 to 1. This means that for it to be correct for you to call, there must be at least 2.4 times the amount you must call in the pot. In other words, the amount you must risk, in this case $1, must have a reward of at least $2.40 when you hit your hand.

Chapter five gives an overview of Otago's staff, and the various departments they created and expanded. The core of the book is the history of the departments and schools, covered in Chapters six to nine, and arranged according to the current structure of four academic divisions: humanities, science, commerce and health sciences. This is an excellent potted history, emphasising the range disciplines taught in the university, and how the interest in subjects changed over the generations. 
I went into teaching middle school for a lot of reasons. One of the biggest is I had to go back and relearn all the social skills and get practice and observe how to properly react. The kids will never know this, but a lot of times I watching them in terms of their interactions with their friends and conflicts and hallway drama and I learning the wrong and right way to do stuff. I done this now for about 10 years and I still don feel fully ready to be emotionally stable, but it helped me out a lot.

Use an app and website called "Mango Plate." It doesn always have the really local places, but I use it when I am in a new area and need to find some good coffee or lunch quickly. I personally love Korea, I was back here in 2016 for a deployment and as soon as I got out Service I moved out here. One of the big selling points on moving out here is that after the Lotus Lantern Festival there is literally a festival going on every weekend! In fact just this last weekend I went to a drum festival and this next I will be going to some sort of light festival. Enjoy it for what it is you don always need to travel with someone it is a very safe place here.

But yes, for the most part it makes people revert to their base and primitive nature and it is absolutely destructive   and is a danger to society if they ever are going to leave prison and have to reintegrate. I know I wouldn want to live next door to a guy who spent the last 20 years being mentally tortured who is likely to snap at any time. After a certain point that life becomes so normalized and they aren phased by it, so it not a sufficient deterrent to re offending   and they may even prefer it and re offend simply to be back where they are comfortable..

Here an interesting twist on electricity and the telegraph, but not quite what you expect. The note, written by "Moderator", appeared in Mechanics Magazine for 15 June 1825 (volume iv, p 148).

This is awesome! Honestly 125 is pretty good for the first time. I think the first time I deadlifted like 65lbs in the rack because I couldn do the big plates lol. It is a little intimidating at first, but now I literally don care if other people are in there. Anyone who makes fun of somebody else for trying something new is worthless. And they probably couldn lift the same weight anyway because I feel like anybody that actually can knows what it takes to get there. The process of getting your form down and everything is great, but when you get to the point where you start putting up impressive weight and clearly know what you doing, that a pretty amazing feeling. To anybody trying it out, stay consistent and you will get there!
My first board gaming convention. I hadn played many games at that point and, as one might expect, needed to be taught the rules to each I tried. I arrived early on morning while some guy was setting up a game of Arkham Horror, complete with plastic models and small flag/standard that advertised the game. Seemed cool and he asked if I was interested. "Sure, I hope you know the rules well enough to explain them to me", I replied. He chucked and said "No problem". About 1/4 through the game, the player next to me leans over to me and simply states, "It not often you get to play a game with the designer, right?" You guessed it! Richard Launius was running the game. Eventually, he started dropping in comments like "When i originally designed this." or "I thought this was better in playtest if the rules is played as.". Also got to have lunch with him and a couple of his friends afterwards. All around nice guy and very approachable.

The recovery from the Great Recession, and then the recovery from the oil shock, were fuelled by household debt.

I had a similar situation in that, when I discovered the benefits of the mega backdoor roth, I immediately inquired about whether our company offered it, and if it didn what we needed to do to add it. I was generally fed answers reflecting little or no thought, and no actual inquiry, into whether this was feasible for our company, which also has about 60 70 employees. Probably sounds familiar to your situation. I started researching things like discrimination testing and quickly figured out that, whether we could or could not offer the mega backdoor Roth was something that we needed to actually test, rather than dismiss out of hand.

It may very well be that one major response to Assad victory in holding the coast of Syria is to try and reimagine Sunni political power in the region as being centered amongst those disenfranchised at the moment by Iranian clients in both Iraq and Syria.

Hopefully in the future instead of using a model where at any given time a customer is using a single upstream pathway which when a problem occurs requires a 5 minute outage to switch to another pathway, some form of link bonding is used so that multiple pathways are used from a single customer to upstream houses at all times and as latency increases or packet loss increases, traditional packet by packet routing decisions are made to route around the poor link.

Everything you post is spot on! We love our drive home and are glad to share our road with bikers and others but the groups, as of recent, are too much. It has been discussed in our household, and agreed, that we will not pass riders unless safe, and we will not go into the oncoming lane unless clear. It is a good and safe practice. However with the large numbers in a group riding several riders across the lane, then moving into two columns when the riders think it is safe for a car to pass, it is still dangerous and I will not put myself or my car in danger. I am one of the drivers that will get tailed and honked at because I will not pass the bikers if not clearly safe. Other drivers do as well. I completely agree that someone will get hurt. So, whether you are biker or driver, please please use our drive, HRD, safely but with consideration of others. And don be an ass about it. It is the right thing to do.
