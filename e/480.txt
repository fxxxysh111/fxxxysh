Skirmishers aren really useful and I only use them for fun. Having your infantry brigades detach skirmishers are very useful but really detract from them. So does cavalry skirmishers.

I tend to check out most boy idol shows since they are really easy to watch idly to relax and I went into this thinking it would be just another one to add to the pile but I actually started getting interested in the characters and got attached after a few episodes (I think I got too many screenshots with lines that felt relatable, oddly enough, lol). The characters stories seemed simple but got you curious, the banter felt silly but made me grin like an idiot and their little "adventures" weren out of the ordinary for an idol show but they kept me wanting to watch more (that pause for the last few episodes killed me). 
That said, say hello again to flibanserin: the little pink pill with the Food and Drug Administration's strictest "" warning, the strongest warning used in the labeling of prescription drugs or drug products by the FDA when there is reasonable evidence of a serious hazard associated with taking the drug. The drug is effective in just somewhere between 8 and 13 percent of women, and can cause fainting, dizziness and low blood pressure, effects which were found to be increased by alcohol and hormonal contraception. In fact, total abstinence from alcohol is required, because unlike Viagra for men, which is taken just before sex to enhance physical arousal, flibanserin (a failed antidepressant) has to be taken daily.

If more players of one particular race make it to blizzcon, they can essentially rig the map pool in their favor. If they solve this by normalizing the votes so each race has equal representation, then the opposite problem occurs   if your race is overly represented, then your vote matters less, so if you like a particular map that the majority of your race doesn commonly favor, you out of luck..

For me it really drove home the disparity between the live action productions and the animated stuff.

The tells are very subtle at first but once you train your brain to recognize them, you will be able to make incredible check backs and folds.

The equation for this semicircle is (x 1)2+y2=1 (for y>=0). To figure out the intersections, we plug in y=mx into this equation to get (x 1)2+(mx)2=1, which is a quadratic equation in x. This can be rearranged as (m2+1)x2 2mx=0. We already know that they intersect at x=0, so we can divide through by x to find some other intersection point. This gives x=2m/(m2+1). So for any finite m, there will be two intersection points of this corner with the semicircle. But, as m goes to infinity (which means that the line is becoming vertical), this intersection point is getting closer and closer to x=0. This means that only when the this line is vertical that we get 1 intersection point, which means that a right angle is the smallest angle in which we can actually fit the semicircle.

Ah I see. I think there's a flip side to this. How do you mean "better." Did more students matriculate to university? Or was there a lower rate of disobedience? Was the atmosphere more social inclusive? Or were there more opportunities available?
Since her initial story was published, and even more so following the release of Chop Suey Nation, legions have expressed their loyalty to the Chinese restaurant they grew up with.

The first part: "I am a lucky player." It sounded like nonsense, until Caro explained he was riffing on the gambling adage that you should never complain about "running bad"   sustaining a losing streak   because most people don't care and the few who do are just glad it's not happening to them.

Why should your life be any more affected by their issues? If they have a problem with you moving on (either physically or emotionally) strait up ask them why they want you in their life.

The wonderful thing about online poker is a player can play more hands, and you know what that means for poker winners more winnings! Also, the ability of being able to play multiple tables is a plus. No time is wasted in online poker and this is not possible in real life poker. It is no longer necessary to wait in line for a table to clear up since a poker site will always have a table available for its members..

All spot on advice. Only I would probably add: move. Move across the country. Claim a new job or something. Break that immediate social circle. Friends are going to notice something when someone goes from living paycheck to paycheck to suddenly buying even a modest new car. Claim you or your spouse were offered a better paying job someplace else and move. Easy to explain a nicer house and a nicer car to friends who drop by a year later. "Oh, yeah, the new gig treats us well. It was worth moving across the country."

At this point in their careers, Will Smith was a lot more in demand than Keanu Reeves though, and had just come off of Bad Boys, Independence Day, and Men in Black, all back to back to back, and was probably considered the most bankable blockbuster movie star in the world. He was probably drowning in offers and pitch meetings at this time, and when you that big and that young you are probably going to shy away from films that take big risks.

Breast Health. Circulation within the lymphatic system is an all important part of maintaining breast health. And, you guessed it, bras compress the lymph vessels that are close to the breast's surface, preventing the flow of the lymph fluids that help to clear out toxins. So, many women choose to forgo bras for reasons of health and not just comfort. To women who feel compelled to wear a bra, consider massaging your breasts at the end of the day to increase lymph fluid circulation. (To the guys who are reading this, we're talking massage for the purposes of health and not arousal.)

I thought you agreed that if someone were to spam with 2 or more posts in a 24 hour period then that user could be banned. How it currently written is just weirdly written because the submitter the one spamming so what is he preventing?

Although many chop suey classics   including the cuisine's namesake dish and ever popular General Tso's chicken   are imports, largely from San Francisco's Chinatown, Hui learned that there are uniquely Canadian contributions as well.

In the rare case that your saves get out of sync, which can happen with Play Anywhere games (playable on both Xbox and PC, sharing your progress) for instance, your Xbox should prompt you about a conflict, meaning that there are two saves (with timestamps!), and then letting you pick one. You most likely never see this happen either.. 
This sense is now obsolete, but it led to the meaning "excessively enthusiastic, especially about religious matters." The word later became less specific, meaning simply "excessively enthusiastic or unreasonable." The noun fan, meaning "enthusiast," is probably a shortening of fanatic..

If your vision of casino players is James Bond, in a tux, at Monte Carlo, forget it. American casinos do not enforce that kind of formality. Casual clothing and sportswear are most common, but you'll see everything from evening wear to T shirts and jeans in the same casino.

Negative liberties are fine but they don mean much without material security.I mean i ain gonna lie to you son, i no liberal, at the very least i libertarian socialist (anarcho syndicalist).I say its more of a philosophical difference between the difference of a right to be FREE FROM something, and having the material ability and means TO DO something (time, money, security whatever). In my opinion the US (and plenty of other countries, but i live in the us) is only succeeding in providing some negative liberties (freedom from having your guns taken away, or freedom from government action over your speech, OG john locke type stuff) than creating any positive liberty (Security of any kind that would allow people to do what they want). Financial, health and jobs security, in my opinion, is a big part of allowing people to actually be free to do the things they want to which i would consider a more important freedom than the strict "constitutional freedoms".

"I always say the biggest game of the season is the next week," Hopson said. "In football, we count our poker chips up at the end, but this is a big football game. Our kids understand it's a big football game. That's a little plus on the side of this game, but I said it last week that we're in a five game playoff, and now we're down to a four game playoff. That's the reality of where we are as a football team. It's the next one up, and it's the biggest one."

The running title at the top of the page in the Journal of the Franklin Institute (September 1860) reads "Straightening a Colossal Chimney Stack", which attracted my immediate attention. It was constructed in 1859 in Port Dundas, near Glasgow, Scotland, and evidently needed some help in being straight out perpendicular. The chimney was 454 tall, and the tallest in the world it was also one of the tallest masonry structures in existence. And it needed straightening. tallest chimney was built at Port Dundas, Glasgow, Scotland, 1857 to 1859, for F. Townsend. It is the highest chimney in the world, (454 feet,) and one of the loftiest masonry structures in existence. It is, independent of its size, one of the best specimens of substantial, well made brickwork in existence." September 8, 1895, Page 17, The New York Times Archives

Lets do stats then! Ok, so the drop rate is about 1/250, so i should get the boots after about 250 clues, maybe a lot more, maybe a lot less, but also maybe just every 250. So if 250 people try for a med clue, then about 1 person should get the drop out of 250 people, and if 1/250 of those people happen to get that drop for their first med clue scroll, then that means one in every 250 people will get that drop as their first one, maybe a lot more people, or maybe a lot less people, or maybe just about 1 in every 250 people. 
Then she says,' We are trying to find him a permanent therapist who can make the decision about hospitalizing him or putting him on meds.' My thoughts are,' why haven't you done this yet?' But I hold my tongue. 
They looked at more than one angle. We don know which one the decision is based on. On the the angle he was looking at visible for us was an angle where no clear hit was visible. They showed the same angle later zoomed in and zoomed out. And there was no hit visible that could justify the change of the refs decision on the pitch. And you are just doing it as a hobby I guess. And in portrait and street apcs are almost as good as full frames. (The lens is more important anyway). But in landscape, you would highly benefit from a full frame. But considering you won get any new glass soon the 7d + 18 200 is a great all around camera but you will not get all the shots (in landscape) you could get with a different setup(full frame + 2 4 lenses).

The vast majority of the means of production are not the products of the capitalists labor. They were made by other workers.

What I talking about is very different. Since the bitcoin mining is centralized so much, Bitcoin has effectively lost it censorship resistant feature. Take a good look at ETH DAO hack. Miners refused to mine transactions that belonged to the hacked accounts and they threatened other miners that they wouldn mine blocks on top of their blocks if they included them. This is pure censorship. If you think the same can happen to bitcoin.

Vases were now painted by covering the whole vase in black while leaving out silhouettes of figures, which then appear in the colour of the clay. Details were painted in black rather than being incised into the clay, which allowed more detailed pictures in the so called 'Red Figure Paintings'. Very realistic pictures were also painted on wooden panels. There was even already a representation of linear perspective, light and shadows and many other things that made paintings more realistic. Even cloth and tapestries were decorated with all kinds of pictures.
Relatively few airlines have placed orders for the very expensive Airbus A380, and aside from Emirates, who by far and away have the largest fleet of A380s anywhere in the sky, most airlines are taking things very steady with this aircraft, as the size of it means that airlines will be expected to carry up to 500 passengers per flight in order to cover costs, and in this economic atmosphere, there are very few routes on which this is now possible. Thai Airways and Malaysia Airlines in particular have big problems utilising their A380s properly, and it could be argued that neither actually need all 6, as 3 foreach of them would be sufficient (for their ultra longhaul flights to Paris and London respectively)..

Now let say they have deductions worth 50% of that so they get $2867.5 back at the end of the year.

Your argument doesn hold water unless you make a large sum of water and I bet $20 you already know this yourself and you against income taxes because you hate taxes in general. Meanwhile, you love America just not enough to happily pay taxes so you want more people to be against taxes.

The flowers should be cut just before they open, and on a warm day after the dew has dried, but before the day gets too hot. (If you're using leaves rather than flowers, they can be left until midday, when the aromatic oils are at their highest.)

At this exact same moment that People asked us to protect young women like Ms. Love while ignoring young women like Ms. Snipes, ABC "What Would You Do?" aired an episode about battered women. the episode two actresses, one white and one black, were put into a restaurant and played out scenes with their "boyfriends" who acted out the role of abuser. producers wanted to see if race played a difference, but they also had an idea that class might be important as well. in one scene the actresses looked bruised, but middle class. the other scene, they dressed "provocatively"  or as my 8th grader would put it  like skanks and hos. Not surprisingly, fewer diners intervened on the more conservatively dressed black woman behalf than the similarly dressed white woman ladies deserve more protection than black women. here the interesting twist: NO ONE intervened in either woman behalf when they were dressed in a more sexualized manner.

Yeah sure. It's hard to figure out what isn't okay sometimes when you start. What kind of level are you talking? Saying really mean things about you/insults are something to not tolerate. Having people borrow money/possessions without asking is a hard no. Even with asking sometimes, depending on how often they rely on you to say yes. Physically causing you pain at all (not an accident) is a STRONG no and potentially a call to police. You shouldn't have to give something up in order to have social engagement. If someone wants something from you in exchange from hanging out with you, that is not always okay.

He genuinely cares for Camille and develops very serious feelings for her that feel fleshed out. The part last episode where he got angry and said mean things out of heartbreak (not excusing it as okay but it felt understandable in the context), but you could see in his face how much he cared for her this episode even after all that stuff with John went down. I'm not sure how to interpret his reaction to her scars in the show, but it definitely wasn't the outright disgust he had in the book. 
On the flop betting betting is fine when checked around. His bet sizing is small enough to get value from marginal holdings such as flush draws, small pocket pairs and worse 7x hands.

As the judge observed, the wording in the act is but it is also very wide in its scope as to what constitutes income. In other words, it casts a very wide net and specifically includes gratuities received by a taxpayer. the taxpayer arguments that the tips should be tax exempt because they were gambling proceeds, the judge distinguished between the money won in the hands of the gambler and the money turned over to the attendant. A jackpot winner doesn have to pay tax on any winnings, but when part of these winnings are then paid to a casino employee in recognition of the services that the patron received, nature of that amount changes from being non taxable to a taxable amount in the hands of the employee. judge analogized the situation to a casino patron tipping a server in a restaurant using proceeds of his jackpot win. Clearly, the server tip would be taxable income to the restaurant employee and not deemed to be tax free gambling proceeds.
