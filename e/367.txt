IT companies on Fortune's list of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" have a turnover rate of 5.9 percent, compared to 14.4 percent industry wide [source: Waggoner]. A reduced turnover rate not only translates to lower hiring and training costs, but also results in a more experienced, productive staff that is better equipped to meet the goals of the company..

For the other kids, it was hard because they watched her (and one other girl) score all the goals while they were still looking for their first.

But at the same time it was tough because we played other girls teams that were experience and got crushed most of the year, which isn fun for anyone. Anyhow, we moved her to another program for next season, so that is over with.

TONOPAH   Nye County's brothels will survive without being put to a popular vote, and the suggestive signs that caused a furor in Pahrump are coming down.In a contentious session Tuesday, the county commission voted 3 2 not to put a question on the November ballot asking voters whether brothel prostitution should continue to be legal in Nye County, which has the state's largest concentration of brothels.The commissioners also voted to have the district attorney formulate revisions to the ordinance that governs the brothels, citing concerns that it is vague on crucial questions of advertising and enforcement.Commission Chairman Henry Neth alarmed the brothel industry last month when he put an item on the agenda that could have led to an outright ban by commission vote. He admitted on Tuesday that the move was a tactic to pressure brothel owner Joe Richards to remove signs at the gateway to Pahrump that show scantily clad women in suggestive poses."The whole issue was about the signs," Neth said in an interview after the vote.

If anyone else has ever had a panic attack while running, you know how terrible it feels. So against all received wisdom and good advice, I decided to do one thing I could do to take control of my fear and switched my last training long run to a full half, so that way even if I biffed it on race day, I would have this experience under my belt and know that I could do it. It was hard but I was pleasantly surprised by my time   2:19. I figured if I made that time again on race day, I'd be glad and maybe I could even beat 2:15.

(Canada) My friends grandfather used to be the chief of police in a 12 person town. In a nearby town (driving with my young friend at the time) when going from a 80km/h to a 60km/h speed zone he was coasting as most people do. A cop was parked immediately after the 60km/h sign and pulled him over because he didn slow down all the way to the new speed by the time he hit the sign. So the chief of police doesn let on who he is and politely discusses the issue with the cop, he explains that clocking people so close to the sign is entrapment as per the criminal code. The cop gets mad and says things like "Don quote the law to me", then after they both get a bit flustered the cop says he going to write a ticket. So now the police chiefs had enough, shows his badge and starts ripping into this cop for using this tactic on civilians and how his tactic was illegal.

Never you mind that the ratio of fuel/oil/compression is becoming ever and ever more unequal   there are more and more pistons, but fewer and fewer are getting their needs met. Sure those pistons that are firing best are firing better than ever, but the ratio of pistons failing to pistons successfully generating pressure inside the engine is collapsing   and the building up of dangerous exhaust particulates, of unradiatable excess heat, of flaming wreckage, of flying shrapnel surrounding the engine is becoming so catastrophic that it is threatening the entire ecosystem surrounding it.

Dr. Fasano and other experts speculate that once immune cells are mistakenly primed to attack gluten, they can migrate and spread inflammation, even to the brain.Indeed, Marios Hadjivassiliou, a neurologist in Sheffield, England, says he found deposits of antibodies to gluten in autopsies and brain scans of some patients with ataxia, a condition of impaired balance.Could such findings help explain why some parents of autistic children say their symptoms have improved sometimes dramatically when gluten was eliminated from their diets? To date, no scientific studies have emerged to back up such reports.Dr. Fasano hopes to eventually discover a biomarker specifically for gluten sensitivity.

Other Strategies An article on the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website discusses strategies followed by four orthopedic surgeons who in many years of practice had never been sued. These physicians shared a number of characteristics and behaviors, which they recommended to their fellows: be competent; communicate well with patients, colleagues and other staff; follow the basics of patient safety and patient care guidelines; and use checklists and tickler files to avoid missing something. In addition, they suggested basic common sense: don't perform elective surgery when tired; deal with complications immediately; maintain a relationship with the patient even when something bad happened; and most important, treat patients like family.

The thing is, poorly educated people who don understand or care about nutrition but still eat meat are just as prone to vitamin deficiencies, of different kinds.

A common frustration for patients (and doctors) with discogenic back pain is that the patient starts to feel better, muscle tone begins to improve, motion improves and then something happens  they sit on a long plane flight, they sit in a restaurant leaning forward too long, they sit through a long movie, they go on a long car drive, some random, sudden event happens, or they overdo it trying to start an exercise program back up. What happens? Pain increases (flares up), the stabilizer (inner) muscles become inhibited again and the global (outer) muscles become hypertonic..

Do you check the middle of the moss before watering? Most store bought orchids are packed tight with moss and it takes a while for the middle to dry out, but the outside is bone dry. Then what happens is it starts to rot in the middle. It might be that you need to repot the orchid, especially in bark rather than moss. Honestly though, I done straight moss before and they are ok. It comes down to paying attention to the plant to see when it needs watering, not just a schedule.

The story wasn really true, but it truly hit a nerve that caused rioting in the streets and a flurry of laws meant to control sex (anti prostitution, anti sodomy, age of consent). Much studied by historians, the event is considered to have been at the center of what it meant to be protect white women and girls virtue against the corruption of the upper class and therefore degenerate "gentlemen" and poor and/or brown men who were therefore degenerate "brutes." By creating categories in need of protection (white women and children), British and US ruling classes could shore up white privilege (because if white women of all classes weren pure, then how could violence against brown and black men be justified?)..

And while I call him out for not having emergency supplies for self recovery or survival, very few of us truly know how we'd handle such an emergency. Beyond a shovel, self recovery gear can be expensive and require training. I believe it is very smart to be as prepared as possible when driving off road in remote locations, and that didn't happen here. But we don't know the fullness of his situation, thought process, or preparedness in general. Combined with a record breaking snowfall, anyone of us prepared or nots might've easily gotten stuck. The bottom line is how long a prepared traveler would've remained stuck, and how comfortable (fed, warm, hydrated) they would be until recovery.

I suffered for years with an undiagnosed autoimmune disease. I gained weight, retained fluid in my legs, had pain all over my body, was tired all the time, and so much more. I was told that it was all in my head, and was even put on medication for various mental health disorders when the doctors gave up on trying to figure it out (which made many of my symptoms worse).

If there was a better government in place in Islamabad we could have traded our vital contribution to America's war in Afghanistan into a better set of economic aid figures for ourselves. But we've never been able to play this kind of poker game well. We somehow can't transcend the penchant for settling for the cheapest possible bargain cheap at our expense: coolie work at coolie wages.

When you go up to the prosecutor desk you can ask if they would be willing to accept a plea bargain for a reduced charge.
