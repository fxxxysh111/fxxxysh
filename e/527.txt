If nobody likes it when women wear too much perfume, then why do they do it? Sometimes the nose doesn't know, particularly if a woman doesn't have a very good sense of smell. Smoking can contribute to this, but smokers also use perfume as a way to cover up cigarette smell. Wearing too much perfume might also be an indicator of depression.

Imagine an 8 billion piston engine. .01% of pistons get all the best fuel and oil, to compress time and energy and resources and in so doing, generate work. The rest of the pistons get too little fuel, oil, or both. By the deliberate design of the pistons themselves that are swallowing everything up. Millions of pistons have already permanently failed and need replacement. Millions are showing signs of early wear and tear, bad seals and housings and low quality fuel, and low quality oil. Turns out the best fuels and oils, that instill the best longevity, are reserved for the children and neighbors of the best performing pistons, and not the hardest working pistons (as some pseudoengineers would have you believe.) Some pistons, through the complex engineerings of austerity, saving, luck, and privilege occasionally get necessary replacement parts. Many pistons fail before ever even getting a chance to get up to speed. And after their failure, are somehow blamed despite their constant cries for more fuel, more oil while yet living, and spinning, trying to generate more power. Yet again, there is some mythological class of pistons who receive such meticulous maintenance as to never encounter a breakdown of any kind, in perpetuity, until the end of time.

Rock paper scissors is a zero sum hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. Other names for the game in the English speaking world include roshambo, ick ack ock, ching chang walla [where?], and other orderings of the three items, sometimes with "rock" being called "stone".

Wow, crazy how that works. It almost like businesses, when forced to pay people $15/hr instead of $10/hr, will just cut the amount of workers or the amount of hours they work so that wages are still about the same percentage of their revenue. Who woulda thunk it? Oh yea, anyone with even the most basic understanding of economics. Ask all those people who lose their jobs when the minimum wage goes up if they happier now that they arent working and aren employable because they can do anything that provides $15/hr of value to their employer.

The part that turns red and spins is called a sprocket. It what chains ride on, like on your bicycle, how you move the power from the pedals, to the rear wheel. The sprocket needs to be hard to last a long time because the chain slides on it a lot. To get it hard, you heat treat it (someone smarter than me can tell you exactly why it works). The copper coil that surrounds the part runs a lot of current through it, and that induces a magnetic field, which induces a current in the sprocket. When you put current through things, they usually heat up. Then once the part is brought to a specific temperature, it is quenched in water below the coil. This is just part of the heat treating process, because the rate at which things cool effects how the heat treatment is held.

You caught me on listening to a lot of metal, where the lyrics are generally hard to decipher and incredibly silly when they finally are uncovered. I also listen to a decent amount of emo music, which is pretty consistently regarded as lyrics driven, though I think the pathos delivered by good emo vocalists is what really draws me to otherwise sophomoric expression. My favorite hip hop has interesting enough lyrics, I guess, but I think sound design in hip hop is a much more interesting and fruitful direction. I don listen to a lot of old school hip hop for this reason   the production tends to be one dimensional in comparison to the contemporary direction(s) of the genre.

"Aural memory" alone makes any subjective comparison more or less invalid, and the longer it went between the listens the less valid it is.

Renovating was a money pit; lots of unforeseen problems (extensive termite damage). Ended up paying another $100,000 to make the place a "forever home," and that includes the termite repairs. Will have to keep on the termite prevention for the rest of our time here, which also isn cheap. Could have probably done the renovations for $40,000 if no termites were found and I just wanted the place to be "livable" instead of awesome.

I think big games like the World Series are an exception, but in general poker is more interesting than baseball because there more for the (average) viewer to do watching poker. Obviously in neither case can the viewer actually affect what happening, but watching poker you can better put yourself in the place if the player and think about how you would handle situations at the table.It seemed like they just wanted to make fun of kanye and kim without. you know, actually making funny jokes.

CharactersDonald Duck made his first appearance in 1934 and is one of Disney's most popular characters. In fact, he has appeared more often than any other character, including Mickey Mouse. When Mickey Mouse became a cultural icon and was considered a role model by many, Donald was created in order to be Mickey's naughty comic foil who is led into trouble by his short temper. As well as appearing in 150 short films, including the Oscar winning Der Fuehrer's Face (1942), Donald has appeared in numerous full length films. These include Disney Classics such as The Three Cabelleros (1944), Fun and Fancy Free (1947), Melody Time (1948) and Fantasia 2000 (1999). He has also appeared in other Disney films such as The Reluctant Dragon (1941), and performed opposite Daffy Duck in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Donald was first voiced by Clarence Nash in 1934; Nash last played Donald in 1984, 50 years later.

Second, the standard test used by medical doctors for magnesium measures serum magnesium levels in the blood, but only about one percent of this mineral is found in the blood. Rather, about 66 percent is found in bone and 33 percent in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In order to effectively asses magnesium levels that reflect how it works in the body you need to test content in the red blood cells. It's very common for individuals with serum magnesium lab results in the normal range to be deficient in magnesium.

I think she's purposely backing off the planting theory to get them to comply with her testing requests. If she keeps attacking the state that they are guilty of something they will keep fighting her. There is a new AG so I think she's just trying to play nice to get some leeway. All the things you mentioned I agree with but about a new trial. KK did not prove the murder happened the way he described, if anything Kathleen could tear that story apart in a new trial. I just say if he's guilty let the evidence stand and prove it. Give her full access to test everything. Car bones whatever they have. The fact that they aren't willing to is suspect.
Platform: Xbox One, PS4Price: 9.99Black White Bushido is a proudly simple idea. Choose a warrior from the shadows in full black gear or a warrior of the light, clad in brilliant white. Each tight little 2D arena has alternating areas of light and shadow that enable Bushido of the right colour to blend in and disappear, occasionally turning hunter into hunted. With four players, it's a riot of dodging around the platform based levels or an edgy standoff between statues, all waiting to ambush the others. It's about bluffing, memory and intuition. Play against AI opposition, however, and everything goes out the window as they hone in on you time and again, so best to simply enjoy the excellent poker style deception in multiplayer.

It not so different for building higher tech stuff, you can build custom stuff on a very high quality level with just a few people, not each component will be handcrafted if we talkings electronics, of course, but designing and optimizing the circuits, hardening them for high physical stress or high danger environments and then offering good service will have its price for the buyer. They need/want long term relationships with their customers.
