Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.

There has always been another aspect to political management, which is not directed at others but at Dr Manmohan Singh himself. It is not about leadership but about survival. In this he is not apolitical at all. Perhaps he learnt on the job; he definitely learnt a thing or two from his old boss and former prime minister, the late PV Narasimha Rao. PVNR not only pushed Manmohan Singh to liberalise the economy in 1991, he also taught him that politics is a game played very slowly, and in a way that allows others to do the work. With PVNR, for instance, taking no decision itself was a political decision; it was a way of playing things out to the last possible moment, where a decision that he might have originally wanted was the decision left standing after the others were eliminated. Inactivity was a political stratagem. It was exemplified by the silence PVNR showed during the six long hours it took for the demolition of what used to be the Babri Masjid, the event for which his tenure is most known (the Congress petulantly refuses to credit PVNR with the economy liberalisation, so we have to wait a generation or two for history to give a more equitable judgment).

What do you mean by guttural and what does it have to do with a language being "harsh". Guttural does have a linguistic meaning, but in my experience most people simply use it as a synonym to harsh as if they one and the same. But does having more "guttural" sounds (say, sounds articulated in the throat, such as pharyngeals and glottals) make a language objectively harsh? I doubt it.

Anti Pakistan sentiment in America does not stem from any innate hatred or mistrust of Muslims, or jealousy of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal either. Americans do not want to be attacked by a nuclear weapon. And whether real or perceived, Pakistan's arsenal is seen to be a threat from the terrorists that populate FATA.

If they come from Pakistan well, it shouldn't be hard for Pakistanis to understand "anti Pakistanism" then, should it?

If you can break even at the game, then you can still make money through rakeback.

Thanks for the elaboration, but I don really see the allegory here. They used the word Marijuana at the same time as they conducted racist speech. This is not the same as adopting a symbol and having it represent racism. And unless I missed something, the word itself doesn seem to be created to convey a racist worldview (in contrast to say, "Negermusik", the Nazi German term for Jazz). I understand that the word was used and popularized by someone who was promoting racism, but I just don see how this actually leads to the word having "Racist roots".

Reason being that; the pot can never be worth the risk due to the rake and other sorts of bonus takes. It doesn't matter if you can read the other person or not cause you can't control the next card which changes the entire universe of the hands in play.(thus making your read usless) In a house game (with everyone knowing the advantage points), it is all luck with even odds. Another way to consistanly win is to get good at cheating.

To answer your question, the AI is programmed to bring a teammate towards the ball when you trapped during a double team. It happens a few seconds after you double teamed so you have time to escape; if you don escape, the AI brings a player you can pass the ball to. The issue here is that, since you dribble away from the double team, you don actually get trapped til you on the baseline. So when the AI brings the player (Ferrell) over to help, he has to go right into the paint, where Nance defender is. So 2k algorithm worked, it just was applied probably when it didn need to be.

Speaking of Germany, its actually kind of sad/interesting how hard the rise of the Nazi Party regressed the nations view. In the 20s and 30s homosexuality was pretty accepted and at the least tolerated, such that in many cities there were gay bars and gay districts with a flourishing gay culture, despite it still being classified as illegal. The rise of nazism and their views on "degeneracy" and "preserving the race" and all that bullshit so quickly took root and within a decade Germany had gone from a (for the time) bit of a gay haven to active genocide. That sort of damage and societal apathy cannot be easily undone. Even now there is a lot of openly anti LGBT stuff in their politics, notably the AfD (Alternative fr Deutschland) who are a frankly horrifying far right backslide into xenophobia, racism, militarism, toxic gender roles, and, of course, homophobia.

It was certainly an evolution over a couple of years. When I first came in, I started asking a lot of questions. So "automated facial coding"   what actually is that? What does that mean? What do we do? You have to ask those basic questions. At one point in time, several people said that we recognize and detect emotions. I thought that sounded simple enough. It was emotion recognition, so why were we calling it facial coding? Then, I spent a lot of time with key stakeholders in the company, including our CEO who was out on the road talking about this new cutting edge technology. We realized that we were doing everything an AI company should be. Our CEO and I came up with EmotionAI in a few minutes before a talk, and it stuck for the first time. It was an "a ha!" moment.

So who does not know Kenny Rogers? The man who made poker one of the most well known old west games with his soulful "The Gambler" song in the early 1980's. He has long been a staple of the country music scene even though he seems to be a bit behind the times when it comes to the pop music that now passes for country. This is nothing that surprises many as Rogers has been linked to a good many stars with his duets and such. Of course there is the matter that he has had several wives. He has many times confessed that he is incredibly hard to live with and can be a bad husband at times. So many people are now asking how he managed to get the new youthful look. Once he was the rugged looking type that made the songs he sang about the old west and such have some credibility but now that has all changed. There has been some Kenny Rogers' plastic surgery going on and that is no surprise to anyone in the scene.

The dealer must then give each player back as many cards as they gave away. For example, if someone traded in 3 cards, they would get 3 back from the top of the deck. If they traded in 0, they would get none back.

Depends on what cattlebeast we are talking here, and whether it is horned or not. A bull tends to be more ferocious than a cow would, and double that when he's got horns. However, a cow can be just as dangerous if she has a calf that she needs to protect with her life. And it really doesn't matter what type or size they are! One distracts the bovine while the other comes in behind and tears out the hamstrings. Then when the bull or cow or whatever cannot stand any more and is too tired to fight anymore, then they go in for the kill. However, the one distracting the bovine would have to be really careful about getting in the way of those horns, otherwise it will end up one on one, and the bovine will win. (Full Answer)

I'm not sure what the statistics are out there, but the majority of multi millionaires and billionaires all have very large property portfolios. There are many ways that you can invest in real estate, as you guys know. Regardless of the niche you use, you want to get to a certain level of financial status where you can buy and hold.

Dozens of US and Pakistani officials spend several days poring over the minutiae of the different ways in which the Pakistani government can get projects on its wishlist financed, without the US having to put taxpayer money into the supermassive black hole that is the Pakistani federal consolidated fund. The Pakistani federal consolidated fund is of course where good money, the hard earned halal money of taxpayers Pakistani, British, American, Japanese, and Turkish amongst others goes to get spoilt, in a fiscal orgy whose dimensions are always spoken of but never quantified..

Basically, it became easy to find multiple partners for the first time in history and guys jumped on that band wagon (and each other).

Poker is a hobby. You play poker. Doing tricks with a yo yo is a hobby. Maybe someone tells you "you are so amazing at yo yo tricks, really incredible", then you go to a trick competition and win and just keep winning until you can really justify going to work as it will have too high an opportunity cost to make sense. Since the yo yo money is less stable/secure, you want to factor that in and create a comparable risk adjusted income, so minimum 2 3x current income.

In the last 24 hours I come across two antiquarian outlooks on the longevity of the world coal supply after not having seen hardly anything of the sort written in the 19th century. (The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy". Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know.

Two people are out to get even with the ruthlessly nasty politician Roark (Powers Booth). Watched over by the hulking Marv (Mickey Rourke), gun toting stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) is still heartbroken after Roark killed her beloved Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who appears to her as a ghostly apparition. And Johnny (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is determined to bring Roark down by humiliating him at his own high stakes poker game, even though merely having uncanny good luck might not be enough. But the main story centres on private eye Dwight (Josh Brolin), who is stopped in his tracks when he encounters his old flame Ava (Eva Green), a bombshell who has power over most men she meets. She asks for help with a domestic problem, and Dwight is powerless to walk away even though he knows something is fishy.
Request An Appointment Phone: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a non cancerous condition that affects a substantial number of men as they age, in which the enlarged prostate squeezes or partially blocks the surrounding urethra   the tube that carries the urine from the bladder out of the body. This can lead to bothersome urinary symptoms that may include a weak stream, trouble starting and stopping, the frequent feeling of needing to urinate, greater urgency when the feeling hits, leaking or dribbling, and the sense that the bladder isn't empty after urination. When men are in their 40s the prostate begins to grow, leading to increasing resistance to the bladder's ability to empty.

The name Ernie Kovacs may not be widely recognizable, but his brand of television humor instantly is: Fake commercials, blackout gags, bogus talk shows and satire.

Born January 23, 1919, his death at age 42 preserved his largely unrealized genius in amber, leaving TV historians to gather the crumbs.

We can argue whether or not it is in America's best interests to decrease its influence around the globe another time.

Sure Obama installed experts into his administration. Sure some of them aren't perfect. Obama wasn't a kleptocracy, like trump. Obama did more for the people in a bad situation than trump has in a good situation. Before you start stating "what about the economy" it's easy to see Trump is selling our long term, debt, for short term economy. And only right now are we starting to be in the trump economy. So we will see if this lasts. The debt creator during good times historically has killed the economy. Overall, I dislike any and all corruption so yeah I hated any hint of it with Obama. Far fewer hints of this. It's hysterical you a have twisted the blame for trumps leaks on Obama. Obama was harder on leakers than any previous president. I didn't like him for this. Yet somehow you have managed the mental gymnastics to make Trump leaks Obama's fault. Hilarious. Overall Obama's team obeyed the law. You list fast and furious as a peak of corruption. It was a gun deal gone bad to catch gun runners. An undercover gun smuggling deal gone bad is the peak of Obama's administration "bad deal" or corruption . Like that even holds a candle to the Obstruction of Justice, the 36 indictments. You have this tin foil hat view of the world which doesn't exist. The government is too incompetent to be a large conspiracy. There are too many leakers. You thoughts are so countering each other it makes your head spin. Stop sniffing glue, watch info wars.

That said, the biggest reason why Greece looms so large isn that they were unique. They were better than most, but the biggest reason we think of them is that our culture is heavily based on Greek history. The Renaissance was, in intellectual terms, Europe spending a couple centuries re learning all the old Greek and Roman stuff that had been forgotten in the dark ages. That led to a strong fanboy culture, and that affinity and deep study explains why Greek and Latin are still serious topics of study and widely used in science and law, when nobody but a specialist cares about Phoenecian or cuneiform.

So after we chit chatted for awhile it was time to get our game on. We ended up purchasing two tables because one wouldn't be enough for everyone that comes over. 
The more you read, the more viewpoints and approaches you will see to the game, and therefore have a clearer understanding not just of how YOU can play, but how OTHER people might play as well..

I have very shaky hands. My hands are shaking right now as I type this. I don know how bad yours are, but my tremors are noticeable if you paying attention, but not so bad that it immediately obvious. I gotten some comments before, but the comments have literally never once been accurate based on whatever my holdings were. If I bluffing, I heard, "I knew you had it because your hands were shaking" and vice versa. Though obviously someone could have made the "right" read based on something that I literally always experience and not said anything.

The table is fifty two inches across and has a diameter of forty eight inches, which gives each player ample room when they are laying out their cards. The height of the table is twenty nine and a half inches. The home table is about half the size of the poker tables that are used in a casino, but it is professional looking enough to add some oomph to your regular poker game..

What you trying to do is take a generality and use it to justify sexism. This is what all racists and sexists do. However, what you exculpate yourself with is Marxist notions of power imbalance. What you are actually saying is thus:
It must feel great to be naked and not care at all, given what his life is like. It probably be great for most of us since, from wearing clothes daily forever, many grow a certain embarrassment about being naked which they later conflate with an embarrassment of our figure. But here, he probably blew off a megaton of internal steam he built up his whole life, a mountain compared to our molehill..

In MTG it always felt like 95% of the game was really deck building. And to be sure, MTG is by far the deepest deck building CCG/TCG ever created. Even back before all the expansions. But it always felt like after you built your deck, the actual game itself was basically mapped out by the deck itself.

Second question of the day (visio one just below was first) hope I am not pushing my luck. Have been roped into a poker game tonight. 6 players, 4 strangers, texas holdem, never played for money with more than one person, have no poker face and no basic strategy. Could anyone point me to a page or give me a golden rule or advice or something that I can use to get me through. I will learn the rules myself. Something I can get into my head in about an hour.
In my area, rake wise, there is no difference between a 10.00 pot, and a 19.00 pot; the house doesn rake another 1.00 till the pot hits 20.00.

I not a kid but I think the same. Feeling good by being useful doesn give you the right to marginalize others because they can or won be useful to society as a whole. I even think that if we released ourselves from the obligation of labor to secure thriving, society as a whole would improve. Maybe there would be freeloaders, yes, some for a while, but less and less with time. You can even get bored of doing nothing. And work positions wouldn have to go to people who would rather be doing something else, so most jobs would increase in efficiency and productivity. I done work for pay and work for free, as a voluntary, many times. I usually work harder and feel happier when I work for free, even if I have time pressures. So, somebody like you would have the chance to feel important by being useful AND wouldn have to do extra hours to make it until the next paycheck.
But if you compare it to those other games I mentioned which had several years more development time. It not worse and in my opinion it at least better than either of them.I also not saying they should rush DA4. Just that more development time doesn always mean a better game, as Bioware has proved with it last 2 projects.

This way, if you have any additional players show up, there is ample space for them. There are also many accessories that you should look into when choosing a round poker table.

After the PLO University, we gave Fernando a pay raise to show good faith in what he is doing with Upswing.

Thanks, buddy. And I used about three fucktons this year. I responded to a heroin overdose last week and gave him 2mg intranasal and another 2mg IV just so he could breathe on his own. We walked in and he still had the syringe in his neck after his wife gave him CPR. lol During the summer we had a quadruple overdose. These guys were hanging out drinking and then decided to freebase heroin that was laced with carfentanyl. They each got 8mg of narcan and one still got intubated. Shit be cray.

Would challenge our oldest allies to a public showdown is quite remarkable. (Presidents usually do the precise opposite: they struggle to avoid any appearance of disunity.) This is a breathtaking gamble, and the question arises: Is it witting or not? Is the Administration's disdain for diplomatic precedent a strategy a conscious effort to challenge the institutions and arrangements of the past 50 years or merely a matter of presidential pique? The flattery, handholding and creative fudgery that are at the heart of diplomacy are the very sort of fancy pants flummeries that the President abhors. This has been a radical experiment John McCain's Straight Talk Express taken global and the results have been dreadful.
