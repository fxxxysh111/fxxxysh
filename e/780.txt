But right now Asif Zardari seem to have a better hand at the table. And he happens to be a better player too when it comes to political poker.

Edit: to add to that because I miss understood your question. Either one of those suits will match most shirt/tie combos. The one ruel with shirts and ties is that ties need to have one color that in the shirt, so a marching shade of blue or a white spot. But as long as you got some times that go together you be golden. What I use to tell my clients is that they need to get two white shirts and one blue shirt. Get a couple ties that match and a pocket square. That all you need. Even if it one shit, but changing the shirt/tie combo it will give you several different outfit choices. But going back to the white shirt, they get dirty and you find yourself wearing them often. White shirts are something you can wear day after day. Change the tie each day and you look fresh, not like you wearing the same damn shirt 5 days in arrow.

I have yet to meet my significant other, and I graduated from college nearly two years ago. I know this doesn exactly answer your question, but I think the greater issue is the importance you seem to be placing on finding a mate at all. Things unfold naturally and exactly as they should, and the sooner you let that sink through your skull, the better off you will be. I actually stayed in an unhealthy relationship for several months after graduation because I thought giving that up would be resigning to failure and a life without love. But in the weeks leading up to that breakup, I realized how much I meant to myself, and that even if I were to spend an indeterminate amount of time without a mate, I would find fulfillment in other areas of my life. It true, meeting new people after college gets more difficult, but it by no means impossible. It might require a little more effort, but it always possible. And I always heard that you meet the love of your life when you least expect it. I don personally have any evidence of that (yet!), but I more than willing to believe it true. So just slow down, enjoy the ride, and relish the time you have to yourself and the time you have left in college. You only get this once.

Regular veterinary visits. When you take your dog in each year for his veterinary exam, the vet doesn't just give him some vaccinations and send him on his way.

It also helps when you're in an area with limited options. Generally the people who have a lot of money (doctors, lawyers etc ) refuse to play the lowest limits available at the casino. They feel it's beneath them. This leads to the people with the most disposable income playing 2/5 which juices the game. The 2/5 player pool where I play is 30% regs and the rest are people shot taking from 1/2, people waiting to play PLO and people with a lot of money.

Male brothels existed in both Ancient Greece and ancient Rome.[5]Court records and vice investigations from as early as the 17th century document male prostitution in what is now the United States.

The professor who has the greatest impact on Stout, though, is Wharton's Finance department star, Bates McNeer, who has arrived in academia via an unusual path. Having grown up on a farm in Delaware, McNeer got his baptism of fire in finance as a penniless clerk on Wall Street, where he saw the carnage unleashed by the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. A shrewd observer of other people's mistakes, McNeer made his fortune when the markets recovered   and then declared it was "time for a change." A graduate degree from Wharton in hand, he joined the faculty for a dollar a year. By the time Stout arrives, McNeer has become a tenured faculty member who wins rave reviews as the school's best teacher, whose classes are "standing room only affairs."

Honestly the reaction to my last gif was amazing, I haven laughed this much in a long time so thank you all.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. Unfortunately I've met a few people like this, although I've been able to get away from most of them. If it wasn't for this particular man being a family member, and therefore attending family events, he'd be a lot easier to avoid. It makes me feel a little better to know it isn't common that people are like this though, and that others don't think his behaviour is normal, since it's made me more introverted to avoid those situations. Other family members don't seem to have a problem with him, and even have told me to get over it, but then they're all more extroverted and will talk and talk and talk, so maybe they're not so intimidated and drained by him. I appreciate the time everyone took to read this and reply.

Poison Spray, for example, has only Verbal and Somatic components, so you don use a focus to substitute for a material component. Can I still choose to use a focus in order to gain the benefits of Alchemical Mastery?My current interpretation is that I can because I can find any text suggesting that I can choose to use a focus except to substitute for material components.

I had a similar experience. Just because somebody doesn't berate you or hit you doesn't mean they're not "super" abusive, you don't have to minimize your pain. Gaslighting, stonewalling, and withholding affection from your partner are all forms of emotional abuse and can cause very real trauma. I now have to learn how to trust and love myself again. Coming to terms with this fact helped me in my healing journey. We were victims, and now we are survivors! It does get better. It gets better every single day after going NC, whether we initiated it or not. A narc leaving you is truly a blessing in disguise.

That clarification aside, a woman well being should never, ever, ever, EVER be placed second to a fetus. Yes, a fetus is helpless, but it is also not a person yet. Sometimes a decision has to be made. Losing the woman will impact the world significantly more than losing the fetus. If carrying a pregnancy to term will put the woman at risk then that fetus needs to go. If a woman needs treatment but the treatment puts a current or future fetus as risk, then the woman should get the treatment, and if her fertility is affected and she still wants kids some day then there are other options for having a child. The existing human being is more important than the hypothetical one. Forever and always. Hands down. The end.

The problem is, this high profile athletes (Football and Basketball stars) don fall in this category (traditionally.) They spend more time traveling and practicing, make more money for the university, and graduate at a lower rate than other sports.

It was stated very often that is taken into account So clearly there an element of interpretation whenever something is being reviewed. If a huge chunk of Twitter review team has a giant leftwing bias (or an anti rightwing bias), then there going to be way more instances where the interpretation is in favor of someone on the left, and against someone on the right. For example, you might have someone on the left and someone on the right commit equally egregious offenses, but the person reviewing could have an easier time rationalizing "this left winger twitter is full of the kinds of jokes and hyperbole that lefties use all the time. Clearly this isn an actual threat, or any kind of harassment." The reviewer could similarly rationalize "Whoa whoa whoa whoa. That a lot of Pepe memes on this right winger twitter. I need to look at this more closely. Hmm. The extreme language this person uses is very troubling. This could very well be a serious threat of violence."

If you have a pain in the middle of your back or under your shoulder blade, it often comes from tightness in the front of the chest or shoulders pulling you forward and stressing out the back muscles. Laying with a rolled up towel or foam roller along your spine (see Right; a great anti desk posture stretch!) with your hands overhead for 5 10 minutes stretches out the tight muscles and gets rid of the pain. The vertebrae can also get stuck flexed forward, and rolling on a foam roller perpendicular to your spine can help straighten yo out (also try little half inch "sit ups" motions to gently flex the vertebrae).

Want to shop for vintage, but don't know what to look for? Keep in mind the following tips. First,look for quality. Clothes that have been around a while are most likely used, which means you'll need to evaluate their condition. Look for obvious flaws and signs of wear and tear, like missing buttons, popped seams, obvious stains or threadbare fabric. Some signs of age can be fixed to make a garment wearable, but others are just worth passing on   if it has a funky smell, not even dry cleaning might get it out. At the same time, look for functionality. Why buy a vintage dress if you can't actually wear it? Lastly, look at larger sizes than you're used to buying. Over the years sizing has trended downward to make people feel better about themselves, which means a size 2 today could have been a size 6 a decade or two ago. Just make sure to try the clothes on before you buy.

I never been a total non reader, but part of me wanting to do the 52 challenge was because although I enjoy reading I don make time for it. I get sucked into Reddit, lazing about on the sofa and I don feel like it a good use of my time. 
I mean, you're not getting many folds out of this. Is that your point for raising? Because you have roughly around 19.5% to hit your flush on the river, but that's not exactly the kind of odds I would put it all in with. Even an ace on the river doesn't save you against two pair and some straight draws.

Here an interesting collection of bits that I just came across in the October 18, 1883 issue of Nature, showing the speed of things. Some of the examples are quite charming, showing the velocities for an "ordinary wind", a "fresh breeze", "a race horse trotting an English mile", "flight of a falcon", "flight of one of the swiftest birds", and "a tempest"; others show the speeds of things that are quite antique, like the velocity of "a cannon ball", and "an express train travelling at 60 kph". Then of course we get into the high velocity astronomical examples, all brought to a close by the speed of light.

Yes, using a dead legends account is disgusting, yes, especially for advertisement, but Captain Marvel was not a shitty movie by any means, Brie Larsons statements about her intebtions with were just unnecessary and misguided. You see, strong female roles shouldn be more special than strong male roles for precisely the same reasons that she thinks they should be more special, because if you make them "special" and "empowering", there gonna be a lot of bigots, sexists reeling about with foam on their proverbial mouths in disgust, and sheeple who like to pump the hate brakes because everyone else seems to do it will join them in the toxic backlash, and if you instead don mention it, and just say that she feels honoured to play such a powerful and awesome character, you normalize it and nobody gives two craps about anyone gender anymore, and in the end it makes strong female empowerment feel much more attainable to the young women she wants to help than when you make it all special and privileged to be allowed to play a lead role as a woman, resulting in the ugly part of the internet rearing its insultingly hateful head making these women only more insecure and unwilling to ever be the openly strong and self supporting "badass bitches" (in the words of broad city) they want to be, because of the shit they get from neckbeards on the internet. Yes, miss Larsen focused on the wrong aspect of her appearance in this movie, yes, it seems a little unnecessary, but that doesn mean she is a dumb or stupid or bad person, or that the movie is bad..

The following day was our "beach day". We headed out of town and picked up two hitchhikers (backpackers) who needed to go to the beach too. We dropped them off at a hostel with hammocks and all I could think was that I am definitely too old to stay in places that are $4 a night! Our hotel had recommended we go to Playa Roca in Las Penitas.

I was a teenager at the time, and I was instant messaging my gf at the time with my webcam turned on. I had the viewer up so that I could see myself in the webcam. Behind me, there was the stairs leading up (left of camera view) and the entrance to the living room (right of camera view). My younger sister would typically fall asleep every night on the couch in front of the TV and make her way up to bed in the middle of the night. At one point in my webcam view, I saw my sister leave the living room and go up the stairs. The thing that struck me as odd was that I didn hear anything. It was an older Victorian house, so the wooden floor and stairs were loud af. Without saying anything to my gf, I got up and looked into the living room and there was my sister passed out on the couch. I sat back down and asked my gf if she had seen anything in my camera. She said "Yeah, I just saw your sister go upstairs."
Edit 2: Thank you so much for the gold and platinum, too! But what's much more rewarding is everyone's replies to this. Sex and sexual response is such a taboo topic for men and women, even today, and there's so much misinformation surrounding it.
That said, I could probably still be convinced we should think about splitting Amazon verticals. Same with Facebook, which would even have verticals that would compete (Facebook vs. Instagram). I less sure how one reasonably splits Google, thus it would take more to convince me, but consolidated corporate power is almost universally bad so it not impossible.

Do you know where in Toronto you will be staying, If north of Toronto, Casino Rama is good they run 2.5 NL and 1.2 NL and 5,10.

From 60 miles to about 90 miles it was relatively uneventful and almost all downhill. Now to be clear, nothing is ever all down hill around here, you are always climbing in order to descend, so you always have to be turning the pedals. During that 30 miles I had several turns at the front, where I was able to really power through the pulls, it felt great to pull along such a strong group of riders.

Given your example, if you don use post only, and your order is large enough, then your limit order will match immediately with the best sell order (at 6500) and continue matching until it reaches 6700, at which point the remaining volume will be placed as a limit buy at 6700. You telling the exchange that you not willing to trade at any price worse than 6700, and for a buy order that means you won trade at any price higher than what you stipulated, but you are willing to trade at better (lower) prices.

La presse crite n'est pas pargne Dans un grand quotidien paru le 05 fvrier 2010, un des quotidiens les plus diffuss au niveau national, on avait le plaisir de lire la petite histoire du jour, en page de garde. A la lecture de cet article, on apprend qu'une famille a t vacue par la police d'un cinma en raison de la prsence d'une fillette de 2 ans et demi. Selon l'article, l'exploitant n'a fait que respecter l'article 198 de l'ordonnance de prfecture de police de Paris du 1er janvier 1927, toujours en vigueur, qui interdit l'accs aux lieux de spectacle aux moins de 3 ans. Voulant en savoir plus sur cet article, j'appelle tout simplement la Fdration Nationale des Cinmas Franais, o le juriste m'explique que cette ordonnance n'est plus en vigueur depuis 2 ans  Aprs avoir pris contact avec la Prfecture de police de Paris, j'ai la confirmation que cette ordonnance a t abroge par un arrt du 16 novembre 2007 ! Comment se fait il que la journaliste n'est pas pris le temps de rechercher l'ordonnance en question, ni pris le temps de vrifier si cette ordonnance s'applique encore Il est tonnant alors de voir le tumulte autour de cette banale histoire (il suffit de lire les articles de journaux, la reprise par des blogs ainsi que des forums de discussion) qui peut trouver une explication (justifiable ou non, tel n'est pas le problme on peut d'ailleurs douter des diffrents rcits qui sont faits de cette histoire) qui est tout autre que celle relate par des journalistes.

For better or worse, traditional probability problems tend to involve gambling problems, such as die games and card games, perhaps because they are the most commonplace examples of truly equiprobable sample spaces.

If people had money they'd spend it, which would keep companies here. Anyway, saying that capitalism has lifted more people up is like saying that slavery improved people's standard of leaving so it was good for them. Capitalism is actually a cheaper form of slavery because you don't have to pay for someone else's living needs, you can make them fend for themselves and only pay as much as need be to keep the fish on the hook.

What makes it more difficult is when someone goes from 0 to 100 like you did earlier, reading way too much into a mod action and accusing us of fetishizing women as the reason. We heard it all, we too pro Korea, too anti Korea, ethnic Korean nationalists, white sexpats, etc, so those comments have lost their meaning and the truth is the accusation about us usually says more about the preconceptions of the person making the complaint than any of us on the mod team.

Fred cash is piling up because he saves just about half of his after tax income. His living expenses are a modest $2,792 per month. He contributes the maximum (now $6,000 per year) to his Tax Free Savings Account, puts $2,400 per year in his RRSP and about $22,300 annually into non registered savings. He invests in broadly diversified, low fee exchange traded funds which average out the many risks of investing. Were he to lose his job before planned retirement, he could maintain his way of life. His ample savings are a solid financial lifesaver.

I think the designated player thing is a problem. USA has the capital to turn MLS into a NBA like situation where European football and Champions League would become like the Euroleague. 2 teams in NYC, 2 in LA, Chicago, Boston, Miami incoming; imagine if they decided to lose money for a while and have NBA/NFL/MLB like payrolls, getting all the best players in the world to go there. 20 years later, boom, European football is practically their minor league, who needs relegation or promotion.
Covering miles upon miles on long training rides can be tedious alone, and open water swimming in a group is much safer than hitting the waves by yourself. Since most people are less likely to flake out on their training routine when there are others around to encourage them onward, the motivation and encouragement from a group can spur better performances and help athletes get to the finish line without burning out..

Treasury bonds come in a variety of "flavors" or different maturity dates. You can buy short term T bills that mature in three or six months, or long term bonds that won't fully mature for 10 or even 30 years. Normally, the short term bonds will have lower yields or interest rates than the longer term bonds, because a longer investment carries more risk that inflation will eat up your gains over time. So if you plot the yield of treasury bonds on a graph, it will normally curve or slope upward, with progressively higher yields for bonds with two year, five year, 10 year and 30 year terms.

Most laws and insurance companies will say yes, especially if the chip is in the driver's field of vision . However, for rock chips, and even some cracks, consider repair before replacement. It's much cheaper usually. As for how long before you fix the chip, it's a bit of a personal judgment call. The chip might or might not grow. You might fix it today and end up with another one tomorrow. So it's a risk either way. (Full Answer)
