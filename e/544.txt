My buddy Matt once got into a 50 hour long heads up (one on one) match with another pro. Well, the other guy took Matt for over $70,000, at which point Matt decided to take a break from poker for a few months. When I commiserated and pointed out that taking a break was probably a good idea after such a big loss, Matt replied that it wasn't about the money.

The notion that anyone knows best has been proven wrong throughout human history. Everyone makes mistakes, and yes, many of these mistakes are stupid and foreseeable in 20/20 hindsight. The goal is to have a system that can punish mistake makers and to keep power in check through competition and diverse management systems.. 
I actually witnessed this firsthand. A few years ago a shootout actually happened outside my window, and obviously worked with the police on it. There wasn't much in terms of solving the case itself; one of the parties crashed into a ditch, and it's pretty easy if you come across a crashed car full of guns and a shot driver that they might have had something to do with a shooting down the street..

Going off my mother who has hoarding tendencies, she has depression stemming from watching her parents slowly die over a decade. To cope with said depression, she buys stuff, like furniture and books, to make herself feel better.

It seems like the bulk of this is the usual bragging up gate camps, wars organized as in game play dates, weak attempts at eve elitism (or whatever passes for that), posting favorite ships make in MS Paint, high sec/ low sec/ null sec complaining about high sec/ low sec/ null sec being bad/ broken/ awesome and crying about why other players don play the game right (pronounced"play like I do or you wrong").

The origin stories are very good and DAO has the most "dark fantasy" feel of the series. The game suffers from "old age" though and for me it so buggy on my computer now (like literally crashing very often) that I no longer enjoy playing it for that reason alone.

Amazon has changed this though because now all it takes is a tiny bit of success on my part, they see that as a leading indicator, source their own competing product earlier than a typical competitor who wouldn have my sales data.

Phil was equally outraged about what went on at Full Tilt, and still has a strong reputation in the poker community (both Dan Colman and Brian Rast, our two other pro were very excited to work with Phil).

Though it could take a number of months before we get a final conclusion in California, this is the first time a bill without a so called 'bad actor' clause has been introduced, he said. Addition, the inclusion of the racetracks may provide added support for the bill. The other online poker bill up for discussion which was introduced in early December does contain a bad actor clause but ultimately gives California regulators the final discretion on who will be allowed to operate in the market and the conditions imposed.

Is the Most Traveled Book (MTB) a category of book, or a single title, or a single copy of that title? Is it thousands of people moving the book, or is it just the single book making the trip? If it was just a title, then the number of miles packed on Stephen King books traveling back and forth to the beach or wherever by millions of people over several decades would probably outweigh the travel of all of Homer on a galactic scale.

Edit to add some life pro tips: Make sure your prep drink is cold, hold your nose when you drink it, and use a straw. Those three things should reduce the smell/taste by 95%. Also, if you have a choice, go for a 10 am procedure and not a 7 am procedure because they generally require you to drink a final quarter or liter a few hours before the procedure and it better to do that at 6am than 3am.. 
The other reason I don't really like dudes with really nice cars is that I started dating a guy years ago  he had a very nice sports car.

Well the whole time this guy is driving like such a jerk. Speeding, getting the turbo going constantly, tailgating anyone who dared enter the left lane, cutting people off  you get the picture.

Let be real, the vast majority of greenhouse gasses are produced by large corporations, not by individual consumers. Collectively, individual consumers make up maybe 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions. And yet, the vast majority of our efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions are aimed at that 10%. Car emissions standards, tax breaks for using efficient appliances and light bulbs, campaigns aimed at getting people to use less energy on heat and AC, campaigns aimed at getting people to eat less meat, etc. Why aren our efforts aimed at the large corporations who are actually creating the vast majority of the greenhouse gas emissions? Because there no political will to do so. So we continue to be guilted to freeze in the winter and swelter in the summer to save a minuscule amount of energy.

I feel a lot of people just assume that because they in their late 20s/30s and don know what they want from a partner yet means that someone in their early to mid 20s must be too young to know too.

If you not comfortable with exchanging sex for money, maybe erotic massages is more your thing. They operate similar to a Terminwohung from a customers point of view, but instead of sex, the girls will only give you a naked massage (with some body on body sliding) and a handjob as finish.

I will say from looking at the earthquakes it is the main fault moving which in alot of ways is better since the auxiliary fault likes to generate tidal waves in the great salt lake that last of which made it as far as hill air force base. The best thing you can do is make general emergency preparations put a few caned goods and a blanket in the trunk of your car water filtration will be a big thing since the only people who will have water is murray power will probably go out for the majority of the valley.

If I understand what you are describing then just tucking the sheet around the leg doesn't feel very secure, so pulling the sheet from the medial knee and under the thigh to the lateral aspect is most common because you can drape very high exposing the glutes without risk of exposing the genitals, but allowing you to get as much of the muscle available as possible. Sometimes what I'll do when the client is supine is drape the same as I described but taking the extra piece of sheet that I dragged under the thigh and take it under the client's armpit as well, which creates a nice extra bit of exposure for the hip while feeling nice and secure. Hope that helps, I don't have video of this or anything.

Diet. In some cases, the cause of swollen hands is diet. If you notice that your hands and limbs swell at the same time, this may be due to water retention. One of the substances that promote water retention is salt. If your hands tend to swell after a particularly salty meal, you should try cutting back on salts in your dishes and in your snacks. Almost all packaged foods and processed foods contain a high amount of salt and should be avoided. If you are going to eat processed foods such as smoked hams and sausages which have plenty of salt, you can rinse these in water before cooking, or broil them to wash out the excess salt.
In modern times, diplomacy has been stylised and romanticised as somehow independent from its Clausewitzian relation to force of arms.

But critics of the Abenomics strategy question whether consumers, whose purchasing power and real wages also have been declining for more than two decades, are really willing or even able to change their behavior and begin spending more. Abe was grilled by the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) Banri Kaieda in Parliament in mid April on the link between inflation and the higher wages and hiring needed to ensure that the economy takes off.

If you'd like to break into the industry, be prepared for some stiff competition   after all, there's no shortage of people willing to take the job! Start by familiarizing yourself with the various sources for spa reviews, which include industry magazines and directories as well as travel and lifestyle publications. Some popular sites include Spa Finder, Spa Life, Organic Spa, Say Spa and American Spa, each of which maintains online and printed lists of spa reviews. Read existing reviews to learn the lingo and to understand what reviewers focus on. Finally, brush up on your writing and grammar skills, even if it simply means writing reviews about your own spa experiences that no one else will read.
I"m saying it because the plastic body, invented at the birth of consumer capitalism, is central to what it means to be "modern."

I pray that my husbands body will be filled with the holy spirit and not alcohol. Lord I know that in and of myself I am not able to break free of this destructive habit and ask that in Your grace and mercy You would help me to be set free of this ungodly addiction. All you need to do is access the wholeness that is already yours through prayer and meditation on the scriptures. Literally every one Friday, Saturday and sometimes even on Sunday. And Lord for those that are not believers   we ask that in Your grace You would convict them of their damaging behaviour, both in their own bodies and in the lives of those that they know and love, and turn them away from alcohol addiction to a right relationship with the Lord Jesus   in Whose name I pray, Amen Heavenly Father, thank You for helping me along the way to recovery from my addiction to alcohol. When his work is toilsome, pray for endurance and perspective. Lead me to the right church and Christian friends who can support me in this journey, in Jesus Name, Amen We know that you will need to have some support as you are going through this process so you will need to where you can be accountable to other believers in Christ and a pastor.

We're part of a biologically classified group known as continuous breeders, which means that we mate or breed year round. Seasonal breeders, like bears or chipmunks, have changes in fertility and sexual activity depending on the time of year. The females of these species experience an estrous cycle only during certain times, which introduces physiological and behavioral changes that lead to increased sexual activity.

Some 40+ years ago Floyd Mayweather Sr. had the audacity to go into the lab to cook up a once in a generation athlete who'd transcend boundaries very few ever have. Floyd wasn't just a gifted athlete who through "hard work and dedication" was able to "point to easy work", but also a supreme businessman. The way Google took advertisement earnings to the next level, Floyd's shrewd marketing moves in boxing world took his personal earnings into the stratosphere. Starting in the late 2000s Floyd became must see TV and because of secret whispers from mystery man Al Hayman was able to turn the tables on boxing's old guards   namely the everlasting Bob Arum.

At this point in their careers, Will Smith was a lot more in demand than Keanu Reeves though, and had just come off of Bad Boys, Independence Day, and Men in Black, all back to back to back, and was probably considered the most bankable blockbuster movie star in the world.

I always see praise for this book, and I completely disagree, especially about the ending: It thought it was overly cheesy and saccharine.The book in general was not one of his best imo, there were parts that completely dragged (like a big section in the middle where Jake is staking out Lee Harvey Oswald by living near him) where I was having to force myself to keep reading because I was hoping it would get better.Overall I say this book is pretty overrated; it had an interesting premise and some good parts but the flaws were enough that I probably wouldn even recommend it to anyone.Same, but for the whole Sadie plotline, not just the ending.

NTA You're not being homophobic. That's very creepy of him. Your mention of being bothered by him being super openly gay/flamboyant could be misconstrued as homophobic at first, but after you mentioned that, you didn't describe anything except red flags/stuff that crosses many boundaries.

I laughed at the prospect Utah would even consider 10% much less no limit. 6% seemed great to me. Legislators are only likely to truly moved if tax revenue drops or an angry army of bud light pitchfork wielding citizens break down their doors. Is either likely to happen?

This stratagem looks obvious given the eight years of Manmohan Singh prime ministership. There is little he has been proactive about. He used the energies of his first term to push through the nuclear deal with America despite bitter all round opposition. He had a couple of near misses. In 2007, for instance, he was close to a settlement on Kashmir with the then Pakistani president, General Pervez Musharraf. It eluded him due to events beyond his control. So it is fair to deduce that Manmohan Singh is the kind who wants a big moment. The day to day achievements the kind that Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee specialises in do not hold overriding interest. Thus, the routine stuff he is content to let drift. And he learnt to let blame accrue elsewhere. The prime minister, very early on, perhaps learnt to use the fact of two power centres in Delhi he and Sonia Gandhi to deflect responsibility for the routine stuff and the political management.

That creates a "only one way to end game" attitude, which will eventually kill any game unless it is addressed.

Not necessarily. 5.45x39 is a good indicator here, it 7N22 round gets us to .18 G7 BC easily within the form factor of an assault rifle. The solution isn to make the bullet fatter, but to make it much slimmer instead. For example, and this isn what I proposing, the 90gr SMK on the right gets us to about .26 G7 BC to be conservative. 90gr SMKs are loaded into AR 15s quite happily in the .224 Valkyrie cartridge. If we stake our tent somewhere between 58gr and 90gr, and get a BC somewhere between the two to be conservative, we be in great territory. Then stretch the gun a tad to keep velocity up near 2900/3000, and off we go. Nathaniel F Romulan vs Vulcan series really is instructive here.

My first person POV protagonist gets one concrete moment of physical description in the whole story: "Everybody says my twin looks like Winona Ryder but even though we technically identical, she the prettier one." There are a couple references to her body type later on; you only hear about her clothing when it plot relevant. That it. Other characters descriptions are used as an insight into how she really feels about them; they run the gamut from dismissive to thought provoking to really fucking horny, and that all in service of the actual character..

First it must be understood that impressions at work are critical for success and can be very subtle. We must learn to be more aware of the emotions people experience during our interaction with them. Signals of how well we are doing in a client meeting are communicated to us through our five senses and the amygdala in the brain. The amygdala, an almond shaped structure in the limbic system on the inner surface of the temporal lobe, is considered the guardhouse of the brain. It acts as a gateway, assigning and attaching emotional significance to all experiences. If the amygdala identifies danger, it assigns the survival emotions of escape and avoidance. If it identifies a safe environment where there is trust, it assigns positive emotions to the interaction. Examples of survival emotions are fear, disgust and anger; a critical attachment emotion is trust.

Just because its on HBO doesn mean the film is generating a ton of revenue, it just means the film has been bought by HBO for distribution. Details about the budget aren online but I am sure HBO paid enough for the film so that everyone who worked on set and in post could get paid a fixed wage, assume it a union average rate. A lot of that purchase probably covered production losses (renting equipment, studio shoot, any travel reimbursement, licenses for archival footage and music etc.) In doc work some of that money could go to the subjects but it is rarely substantial and it sounds like both of the docs subjects have opted out so thats not the case here. I would assume the directors and producers made the most but I may be incorrect. Regardless I doubt anyones pay was super lavish but if anyone will see a modest return it will likely be them and HBO. Not sure how that would break down or what the numbers are because nothings been released.

As the tournament progresses most of the weaker players will be eliminated. As the blinds increase you are advised to start playing aggressive. Most of the other players around the table are glad to have made it so far and are playing just to stay in the game. If you are confident that your opponent will fold then by all means you should raise. Remember that raising and calling a raise is not the same thing. This is generally known as the "gap concept". When you have a raise a bet you do not need a particularly strong poker hand. But when you call a raise you must be confident that your poker hand is strong enough to win the round.

Bullshit. It is always better to brake than swerve and cause more chaos. Stopping distances for modern cars are incredibly short.

The only reason this thought experiment exists at all is because philosophy majors don know jack about modern engineering.
They lament the dwindling population, but rather than admit that the cost of living and modern work/life balance is killing families, that their attitudes about women working are archaic and that their stance on immigration is xenophobic, they accuse young people of shirking their "national duty" in favour of implied petty selfishness.

She told the judge she accept whatever you bring upon me. 
Driving around a visiting city, they want to know everything about it. Everything. 
Many many many years ago I was working for a retail store with eastern exposure. Every day in the summer when the sun came up until mid afternoon (when we were almost closed) the showroom got unbearably hot. So I called a window coverings place with the measurements of the windows and asked for a ballpark of what it would cost to put up a basic set of blinds.. 
The law is so old an vague that it is subject to interpretation and thus casinos have been allowed the games I specified before. 
Like, NO. 
High endurance athletes actually are at more risk for CVA.Only partially true. Endurance athletes do have higher CAC scores than non athletes, but their mortality is still lower than non athletes. Including lower CVD related deaths. 
Pulling out of the game is the best defense against new and fresh players who are at their peak of thinking.. 
"I told them it was either Stupak or Nicaragua said Wright, who said he counseled Stupak when ownership questions were raised more than a decade ago not to try to sell or auction the display.
Many players are thrown off by this player's ability to conduct himself at the table well. His play is erratic and while he'll do well in spurts, he'll also get beat often. He knows how to play, but often plays by his own rules and likes to bluff for the thrill.. 
He said: you start playing every day you get better and by the end of the summer, I had gone from having a couple of hundred dollars in my online account to having a bank roll of five thousand dollars. 
It just cosmetic.

Maybe take those blinders off and re read what i wrote. Or even read the thread i linked in which i talked about the issues with the mod team that made me leave that cesspool. 
Actually you way off m8. You said it yourself   the joke only works if Peterson is taken literally, which he shouldn be since that not what he meant, so the joke falls apart. Just read the comments   many people here think Peterson really meant "enforced" ie by the state. The OP even clarified, "I was more pointing out the inconsistency between his general stated position on the nebulous concept of "equality of outcome" and his insistence that the state step in to impose that very idea for poor sad incel dudes." Turns out the only woosh is yours.

Sometimes on gambling forums you would meet most desperate gamblers who are able "to serve" up to eight tables. 
And in general. Sure, life is more convenient now. My phone can do anything in China and that wonderful, but due to the economy and overall direction the government is taking, I not optimistic about the future. I can see busting my ass to learn the language when this is not a place I can see myself at for the long term. If you can see yourself here for many years it probably worth it, though I doubt it will hold much value as a professional tool. At almost every company there is someone whose English is going to be better than your Chinese and they will be translating for you during anything substantive.
The game of poker is by far the most popular form of card playing worldwide. In fact, there are so many different ways to play poker that it can practically entertain its own category in card playing. Poker style games can be tracked back as far as ten centuries from similar games which contained poker like rules and the use of bluffing as part of a method for success. The most popular history assumption of poker is that it was originated by Chinese around 950AD which they called "domino cards". This of course was not the same game you see today or any of its variations for the matter. Most all early variations of poker where similar in many ways and then were enhanced and mixed into what many of play today.
You make good points, though I don agree with all of them it more of a different strokes kind of deal. My previous remark about music quality and such is pretty much tinfoil hat stuff, I agree. I just worry that with the world becoming more insular and the value of recorded music declining, that the need for live music and music education could come next, the concept of music will never go away, people will always be making it, but I like that world to stay healthy too for live and recorded work.. 
That sounds plausible. It might or might not be true. Medicines can also mess up your head when you need it to be clear.

Well from what I understand he likes chocolate eggs and I don need to waste money on wine as he can just turn our water faucet into a wine faucet, wait do I get pick what kind of wine he turns the water into? I don want that cheap generic shit. I mean, he the one who produce a feast out of nothing so why am I making dinner for him? He should come to my house ready to prepare food for me.

Also roll partly onto your side and look for sore points in the outer quad, which are often sources of knee pain. Can also be over used, and are also prone to getting "pulled". Quad cramps can sometimes also either cause or be caused by tight hamstrings. 
When I was writing my first book, Queer in Russia, the ultra nationalist politician, Vladimir Zhironovsky, was rumored to like young men, very young men. Despite acknowledging that Zhironovsky would put them into the Gulag, a variety of queer activists in Russia expressed admiration for this leader qualities, including his homoerotic tendencies.

Weaver fought the Site C dam, calling it an environmentally destructive and fiscally reckless boondoggle. And he opposes liquefied natural gas development, saying even a single LNG plant could belch up to eight megatonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.. 
Bestimmt, wie weit ihr gehen wollt. Einige Leute fhlen sich wohl damit bis zum bitteren Ende zu spielen (also bis sie komplett nackt sind), andere wollen vielleicht nicht weiter als bis zur Unterwsche gehen. Stimmt also das Limit ab und auch ob und wie die Spieler im Spiel bleiben, wenn sie keine Kleidungstcke mehr zum setzen haben.. 
You should often be betting somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 of the pot when you bet as that discourages people from calling down light to see the next card..

The federal government has promised revenue neutrality in its plan, but only in how it applies to itself. Varying segments of the economy will see very different net results. The feds tell us that households will be net beneficiaries on average because the incentives they get back each year at tax time will exceed the extra fuel charges they begin paying in April. 
Look. I shouldn't have gotten snarky with you. I apologize. I'm just getting a little tired of of talking to people who have very strong opinions about the documentary but won't take the time to even watch it so that if nothing else they can intelligently rebut it.

That way, the Amazons of the world can afford to expand, making them even bigger and getting an even more disproportionate amount of bargaining power, while the smaller companies go out of business because they can no longer afford to compete. 
As a librarian, I'm surprised. We have meeting rooms that local patrons can reserve but part of the rules of room usage include that it can't be sales or product related. DoTerra would be 100% a no go in my library and honestly, that's pretty standard for any library being run by professionals (not people who have extensive experience and/or degrees in Library Science).
If you consider(ed) an 80% loreweave a requirement, then you could statistically ignore 80% of the rolls you get from divining the item: only one in five attempts would be worth even looking at the other stats.

But since the X Men cinematic timeline was reset with 2014 X Men: Days of Future Past, and next year X Men: Apocalypse is set in the 1980s, what does the presence of Colossus mean for the present day incarnation of the mutant superhero team?
So what does this have to do with you if you don't gamble? It's the wrong question because, actually, you do. Investing, driving, buying a house and merely crossing the street are all acts that involve discernible risks and uncertain rewards. The more small returns you get from your small investments in stocks, the likelier you are to make and lose a big investment.

Pinot Gris, on the other hand, is by far the province most planted white grape variety, accounting for nearly 13 per cent of total grape tonnage. Pinot Grigio), and the fun result for wine drinkers is the sheer diversity of styles available. Oliver Stoneboat PG offers an exciting textural example, with a soft entry complemented by citrusy zip and pep along with nuances of orchard fruit. But take note, only 550 cases of this estate, Sage Gravelbar grown Pinot Gris were produced. Pair with poached halibut for the date night win!

Your struggle has meaning to it, and behind all these emotions lies a deeper truth, lies deeper wisdom, that can only be discovered by experiencing them for the full value they have to offer, and expressing those feelings. 
I seen people on this sub (and elsewhere) posting about the condensation issues with the tent which are then made much worse due to shape of it as your legs touch inner walls a lot at night. That leads to a wet sleeping bag in the mornings. They also talked about it being very noisy in light winds. 
Her breakout events, however, were at the 2016 Aussie Millions in Melbourne. She started that series by taking 21st place in a NLHE 6 Max event and then third in a NLHE Terminator tournament.

The owner, Ellen, really focuses on bringing in RMTs that provide a consistent level of service, and from my experience, she done an exceptional job! They happy to do a more "typical" massage, but will also incorporate elements of physiotherapy (such as myofascial release, recommending stretches or strength exercises, etc.) if necessary/requested. 100% worth it!. 
Ernie tells police he was home alone; his wife Robyn was away visiting family.

You sure you got that the right way around? GTA is well known within the PC gaming community to always be lower due to cpu bottlenecking except at 4k, and I doubt he just casually hitting 4k 144hz. 
Gender discrimination in the workplace is an issue, proper access to birth control and other healthcare is an issue, fair and adequate parental leave is an issue, etc, some trolls on the internet not liking a movie made by billionaires because it stars a woman who a millionaire is. Way down the list of things we should be angry about. It not not an issue, it just not one that has returns which justify all of the political capital we waste on it.. 
Most fans would never have noticed the difference. 
The idea was to invite countries that were not just large economies, but large economies that were strategically important to the US. 
Or at least until they announced that they had overbooked my flight and were there volunteers? I sprinted to the counter and ended up getting flown to Amsterdam followed by a WORLD BUSINESS CLASS (read: seats that fold into beds!!!) to Mumbai.

Ms White entered politics as a party staffer but is without the union ties common among Labor MPs. Her deep connection with kin was evident when she called for a more family friendly parliament on the day she became Labor leader. She took time off to have daughter Mia in 2016 and tied the knot on farmland with her partner Rodney Dann in November.

In recent years the benefits of exercise in ApoE e4  positive subjects have been analyzed. Epidemiological studies showed that this particular subpopulation could benefit relatively more from maintaining an active lifestyle than non carriers [27]. In older ApoE e4 positive women aerobic fitness was positively correlated with better performance on auditory, visual and spatial learning tasks [28].

Have you ever noticed that almost all the expensive Vietnamese food available today in Hanoi restaurants is simply the same common peoples food, but made with the most expensive ingredients? (Is Pho made with Japanese Kobe beef necessarily any better than Pho made with ordinary beef? Not if they don add any spices.)
A bad advisor can really multiply the difficulty. I recommend you talk to Malik in particular, especially considering your interest in ML. He was on my defense committee, and he is both extremely sharp and organized enough to be a good advisor. 
And you might try mixing an oil in with a simpler cream (like the NMF or CeraVe PM) to give it a little extra oomph. 
In America, women are NOT oppressed anymore. 
The first two rounds of betting use the small bet, and the last two use the large bet. For example: In a 2/4 (2 dollar/4 dollar) limit game, the small blind is $1, the big blind is $2, the first two rounds of betting are in $2 increments, and the last two rounds are in $4 increments..

Not only did you have the constant ruckus of the street, starting with the rattling of the carts before dawn (heavy traffic was forbidden through the day in an attempt to allow for some mobility), then swelling as the streets filled with the usual business. Regarding the cleanliness of the streets, it was not particularly uncommon for people to throw waste into the street, as evidenced by the multiple recurring laws that kept being passed, which banned people from throwing trash, animal skins, human waste, etc.
