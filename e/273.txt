I have had the opportunity to test about 15 online poker calculators, and in all honesty, not one of them is perfect for me.

They are, Sit and Go Shark and Hold'em Pirate.

Scoop viewers will be able to watch the live streaming here at this page on all sitting days. However, I would propose that to the extent that Journalism does in fact have a problem, that problem is simply an extension of the market failures of Capitalism. And to the extent that solutions exist, they must be solutions that allow journalism to move outside of the broken system that has caused this situation. This is a global problem.

Hey everyone, please delete if not allowed :) I have a friend who joined the gym about a year ago and he used to be quite skinny, but now he has gained a fair amount of muscle. We went out for breakfast and he ordered two sets of individual pancake meals. He also just eats a lot of whatever, even if it's not necessarily good for him. My question is basically, when people talk about nutrition as it pertains to muscle gain, it seems that there are certain kinds of foods someone should eat. How come so many dudes 'bulk' and just eat anything, even if it's considered 'unhealthy'? Can a female go about this in the same way? I'm in the process of starting to build my body up and I'm pretty small (52 kg female) but all my research indicates that you can't just eat whatever you want to bulk up.

Nice work on your first song! I agree with Fucking Glorious, personal experience always evokes more emotion and imagery than general statements. Most people will infer what going on or what happened based on the context. Also, don be afraid to NOT rhyme at the end of every phrase. Sometimes forcing the rhyme feels obvious and/or makes it easy to not think twice about the line just because you "solved" for the rhyme. Keep it up, you will only get better from here.

The AXA thing is a neat example, and it not wrong, but keep in mind there no functional difference between what you said and AXA paying the flight tracker to handle refunds for them with normal bank accounts   the smart contract is relying on the tracker to tell the truth.

Piercers that participate in training and continuing education know better. Clients of poorly skilled piercers continue to spread misinformation.

Still would be crazy happy to have her win and rid us of Orange Crush but Nikki Haley would be very momentous and historic as she likely run as a Republican and try to challenge 45/an incumbent for the nomination which I don believe has ever happened? Also considering that she used to work under trump at the UN or at least she was nominated by him that would be huge news but have heard no news of her being interested in running and the road to nomination for a republican challenger is very very narrow..

More and more popularity in online casinos is gained by "sticky" or "phantom" bonuses   the equivalent of lucky chips in real casinos. The amount of bonus is impossible to withdraw, it must remain on the account (as if it "has stuck" to it), until it is completely lost, or annulled on the first withdrawal of cash means (disappears like a phantom). At first sight it may seem that there is little sense in such a casino bonus   you won't get money anyway, but it's not completely true. 
There a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves.

The stormy finale of Mahler's Symphony No. 1 closed the Allentown Symphony Orchestra's 60th season Saturday night at Symphony Hall, ending one of the most engaging programs of its 2010 2011 classical series.

The House bill, which moved through its final committee stop on Thursday as well, moves in an opposite direction from the Senate legislation.

In a competition, there are time and space constraints on the match, which necessitate a more aggressive approach if one is to win in the time allowed. As an analogy, you very rarely see soccer players ball juggling in the middle of a game, because the skill is not necessary in the context of match play.

Cards: The saying "you get what you pay for" couldn't be more true than when it comes to purchasing poker cards. Every poker supply store will sell you "cut" or "stamped" cards real cheap. These are cards that were used by a casino and have been retired. They usually come from the blackjack tables and have seen only 5 6 hours of play. But, these cards will get bent and marked quite easily. I suggest you stick with Bicycle brand plastic playing cards, or if you want to go for the professional feel, search for KEM or Copag cards. These are plastic cards that will not be ruined if a drink is spilled on them, they take back their original shape after being bent and are a solid investment for long term use. These cards will cost you $10 $15 per deck but will save you money in the long run as you won't be replacing them several times per night like you would with the cheap cards.

The Celtic influence on English is responsible for the latter grammatical simplification which typifies the English language in comparison to other more synthetic Indo European languages to this day. For instance, the loss of grammatical cases is likely the result of Celtic influence; Old English had four inflectional cases but by the Middle English period, lost them all except for a vestigal genitive   all British Celtic languages also lacked inflectional cases.

At least here the women are working by choice, and have health care, pension contributions, union representation and everything is out in the open so the police know who the problem cases are. This could historically be observed in socialist countries: Even though every person has work assigned, no repercussions existed for slacking off or not doing anything at all. This caused economic output to gradually decrease until revolution or total collapse.

OTOH, polygraph testing CAN sometimes produce valid results, because skilled polygraphers use the machine as a prop to convince people they can get away with lying, and get the people to confess on their own. However, even that is unreliable, and there are no quality standards for polygraphers. If you understand that polygraphy is all a con, the process is powerless against you. So because there no way of knowing how accurate any given test is, polygraph evidence is almost never admissible in court.
I don understand why everyone caping for Warren. Claiming Native heritage as a 98% white person is kind of crap.

Migraine   Migraine headaches can be caused by reduced blood flow to various areas of the cerebral cortex. Symptoms of migraines include sensitivity to light and noise, nausea, vomiting and intense throbbing pain that is usually on one side of the head.

Cards are marked in many ways, but the intent is the same   to allow a player to identify a card without seeing its face. Sometimes a fingernail or small metal piece is used to make an indentation on the corner of a card during a game. A small piece of charcoal or pencil lead can also be used to put a tiny smudge on a card back. Sometimes, the cards are marked elaborately before the game, with subtle alterations of the pattern on the card back. They might be trimmed and shaved along the sides, so that one card, or one rank of card (the Aces, for example), can be found by the dealer by simply feeling along the edge of the deck.

Also, tournaments are such high variance that it can be a bad thing to take the cash.

I had to remove my favorite food bread in order to gain 30 pounds the first time. I had been 30 pounds underweight for 2.6 years, so being 20 lb underweight for a few months isn't a big deal to me.

Liv: laughs Looking back on it, I don't think it was a specific decision that I actively made   it feels more like a random path that life took me on, you know? I had graduated and decided to take a gap year, then I just started playing poker and absolutely fell in love with the game   2006 2007 was the Golden Age of poker and it was all really exciting. In the end of 2006, I made a goal of myself: to be the most famous female poker player in the world. At the time, poker was so exciting that I never considered going back to university these days, I'm moving back towards science again. I just love it so much. I'll never be a researcher, but I think I could add value to the community as some form of science communicator.

Even putting aside taste in stories, quality control dropped hard. One story even had the narrator omit the word "never" when telling us the victims "never returned to school", when the original written story and context make it clear that they died.A lot of people, myself included, are now just listening to the free version instead of the paid subscription to test the waters, and the remaining NS subs have threads asking for alternative horror podcasts now that this one been going downhill. It disheartening because it used to be one of the best horror podcasts, if not the best horror podcast, and now it just churning out stories that range from mediocre to shock value.It stings just a little more because there a few fans who are listening to older episodes for commentary and it really makes you realize how much the podcast grown and then jumped the shark.. 
May not be 50/50 but at least the responsibilities are shared. If shroud had no time at all and was working to the bone every day of the week, I would understand if Jess had to take care of all of the responsibilities. But it just seems like shroud is running away from being an adult. No matter how boomin his streaming career may be, not being able to dedicate even just one hour of his life at least to take care of his girlfriend and pets is a bit scary for anyone. It shows that he just doesn have the mental ability right now to be responsible for other people, or he just doesn care to. Both of which are equally as bad.
Didn Which could be bad news for her because it took her a very long 17.5 hours to make the trip (tired dogs + a 3.5 hour rest stop + breaking trail) while Nic Petit and Joar Ulsom are tearing up the trail behind her. Both of them have already finished their mandatory 24 hour rests and have less than 20 miles to go to Iditarod, which could mean they get there in just a few more hours, while Aliy got hours of rest time left. 
Lol. What? At Incheon? Where did you read that? You do not have to piss in a cup/have blood taken at the airport. At all. You have to pass a medical checkup (mandatory for public schools only) which you do at a hospital within the first month of arrival, but there not a medical bay at Incheon where all English teachers are subjected to needles and plastic cups. (I been here since 2008 btw. Was an English teacher for six years.) So, unless this was before my time from over eleven years ago, I think you mistaken.
One thing that I got out of these docs that I hadn really seen before is the level of manipulation that MJ showed. Some of it seemed to be very "aware", too. I always thought that MJ actions weren intentionally nefarious, that he had a personality disorder developed from childhood trauma and and it caused his brain to function on a different plane. I feel bad for the men.
For example, the cards in your hand include an eight of hearts, but when you look for the corresponding spaces on the board, you realize they're both already occupied by another player's chips. You now have a dead card, which you can announce as such and discard at the beginning of your turn. If you forget to do so before the next player completes his turn, then you'll forfeit the right to draw a card.

The healthcare example is a great one, actually. Watson and the bots will help with diagnoses, surgeries and other automatable tasks.

Max, did you see Margo on one of the morning news shows on Sunday and he blew it. At least say how this border had car thefts and crime up the ass till Silver did hold the line and then Bush built our wall and crime in El Paso has plummeted. I guess he didnt want to hurt anyone feelings ? Fuck, i bet there hasnt been an illegal alien run over while crossing Paisano between the train station and the train bridge at Asarco in years. And no, Billy ran over a homeless guy who may have tried to commit suicide and Billy tried to pull a Bayto and flee the scene, but i guess he was to drunk. Shit, i bet i havent ran over an illegal in that area in years.

We see her basically fighting it as she goes through the flames and it makes SO much sense  it gives Grindewald a perfect edge in his manipulation tactics for anyone, but especially for Credence AND it's a perfect cheeky nod to her first scene when she has Jacob charmed to do her bidding, the poetic justice is just the type of thing Rowling would sneak in right in front of our eyes.

So basically an at risk demographic in a country that already has high rates of tobacco consumption unsurprisingly has an epidemic of tobacco addiction. smoke free attitudes are slowly becoming more popular in mainstream society but lgbtq society is frustratingly lagging behind and they all seem pretty resigned to the fact.
I would definitely play an unraked, taking turns to be the dealer BJ game with friends who probably haven studied the strategy.

A huge number of man caves seem to fall into the sports fan category. If you have any kind of sports memorabilia at all, it's probably rotting in a box somewhere if you don't have a man cave to display it in. Where else are you going to put it   the living room? The master bedroom? We think not. The man cave is your chance to rescue your posters, jerseys and sports equipment from storage and put them where they belong, on prominent display. You can do a generic sports theme, of course, but a shrine to a specific team (or at least city) is really the best way to show your stuff.

Burroughs learns how Julian 5th remained on the Moon for a decade before returning to Earth in 2034 with his lunar wife Nah ee lah. Their son Julian 6th was born in 2036. In 2050 a vast invasion force of millions of Kalkars and Va Gas led by Orthis came to Earth and destroyed the cities of Washington and London. As Orthis had served in the International Peace Fleet he knew how to defeat the Fleet, destroying all their ships until Julian 5th rammed Orthis' flagship, killing them both. Orthis' half Kalkar son Or tis survived. The Kalkars, directionless, nevertheless imposed a savage rule on Earth in the generations before Julian 9th was born. In the generations since the invasion fewer machines work as no one has the knowledge to repair anything, none of the spaceships Orthis designed remain and no one can build any new ones, meaning no more Kalkars can come to Earth but neither can they leave.

Since the men play poker, us women take the opportunity to head out for a night on the town. Unfortunately at our age that means we start at about 4pm and stay out until about 8pm before calling it an evening.

For instance, the cabin pressure may affect the lift, or excess fuel usage may be causing a change in the flight dynamics.

That's what they mean when they talk about the danger of making human rationality or scientific progress an idol. In the traditional Christian view, almost anything can be made an idol very easily.

Mr McFate: Traditional strategists view war like an old fashion lightbulb: it either on or off. But this is wrong, and cunning adversaries like China exploit the space between war and peace for victory. The trick is keeping the American war switch flipped to "off" so it remains docile and at "peace." For example, Beijing goes right up to the edge of war or what America thinks is war in the South China Sea and then stops, but keeps what it captures or creates.

A. The bookshop began as a hobby in a garage back in 1983, a real bookstore in 1984, and found its present home in Onehunga, Auckland, in 1988.

Also roll partly onto your side and look for sore points in the outer quad, which are often sources of knee pain. can also be over used, and are also prone to getting "pulled". Quad cramps can sometimes also either cause or be caused by tight hamstrings.  respond well to slow easy stretching; roll your body form side to side to find the tightest spot, and then sit with a gentle stretch for 2 3 min (or longer), occasionally changing directions and easing into and out of the stretch.

The shorter preganglionic neurons originate from the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord (levels T1   L2, specifically) and travel to a ganglion, often one of the paravertebral ganglia, where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron. From there, the long postganglionic neurons extend across most of the body.[3]The two exceptions mentioned above are postganglionic neurons innervating sweat glands release acetylcholine for the activation of muscarinic receptors   and the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system, and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion: synapses occur between pre  and post  ganglionic neurons within it, but the post ganglionic neurons do not leave the medulla; instead they directly release norepinephrine and epinephrine into the blood.[5]The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for up  and down regulating many homeostatic mechanisms in living organisms.

I don even care if players do put their arms out on purpose or because it a "natural" movement. Part of skill is controlling your body in a way that you don break rules. This goes for sliding tackles where very often skill is the difference between a clean clearance and a foul or even a card as well as keeping your arms under control so that you minimize the risk of accidently committing a handball. If you aren able to try to block a shot without keeping your arms at places were hitting them with the ball doesn award a penalty you deserve to cause one just like with a badly executed tackle.

The minute the second it was announced that Idina Menzel would be guest starring on Glee, fans leapt up and proclaimed, "She must be playing Rachel's mom!" It was never confirmed, nor was it denied, and we've been speculating away based on Ryan Murphy's comments about the "Poker Face" duet."There is much more to her than has been revealed in the first episode that I was in," the Broadway beauty teases. "I will say that her intentions are not quite evil. She's going to unravel more and show a different side to her personality." Idina remains very coy about her character's purpose, but she does throw us for a loop when she says: "Maybe I'm going to be Lea [Michele]'s lesbian lover. You never know!"

Last night I hitched a ride to improv class after a three month hiatus. We had a random appearance of a group of improvisers from Spokane named Cool Whip who were touring the west coast this week, teaching and attending workshops. They were a fabulous young group of kids (I say kids, because I believe they're associated with Whitworth college and anyone younger than thirty is a kid in my book). They were a lot of fun and I hope they come back town. Plus they made the class nice and big which is always a good thing. The more doofuses in a room the better, I always say. By the way   I'll be performing After Hours Saturday night at ComedySportz, if anyone wants to go to the show. It'll be hysterical and if rehearsal is any clue to what's in store: think weird wife swapping factory workers galore. And drugs, lots of drugs.

There are four Reiki symbols (performed via hand motions) used to channel life force energy. Each Reiki symbol has a specific function. For a practitioner to use Reiki symbols effectively, the symbols need to be "imprinted" on a student by a Reiki Master as part of an attunement process. The Reiki symbols were once thought to be sacred, and as such, not to be widely disseminated. However the Reiki symbols were published for the first time in the 1990s and since then, representations of the symbols can be found in many venues.

Let break down the two examples you given and do a cost analysis. In the case of a 1 1 1 opening with a liberator it fits into your build order, although it could be a Viking to kill overlords or a medivac to do a drop. It costs next to nothing in terms of micro as you can shift queue it up and it is not so expensive. Therefore getting a few worker kills or a queen and preventing mining before it dies gives you a economic advantage as well as forcing the enemy to use their micro and attention to deal with it. However, if it flies straight into a spore or turret and dies then it definitely not worth it   you delayed your Viking/ medivac , thrown away 150 minerals and gas and your opponent wasn distracted. What would be best is if you can fly it in, get some kills, then get it out again to do damage a second time. This is micro intensive though, and if you missing production cycles or forgetting upgrades and tech it is not worth it.
My view is that if you are agressing you need less skill to take them out then if you are defensive and they are the ones coming for you (which is what tends to happen with less aggro players/newer players).

However, a long term solution is still likely to be found in a non medical approach. We are all a unique biomechanical and physiological machine. We all have our imperfections and asymmetries. The hip pain may be a result of the unique combination of your biomechanics and your chosen activities. This does not mean there is no solution. It may mean there is no one off, permanent fix. Often a solution is where the athlete accepts that 'Person A' plus 'Activity B' produces 'Pain C' which is adequately self treated with 'Combination of exercises, stretches, warm up, self massage, and appropriate biomechanical alteration to person or equipment D'. It may sound like a simplification, but if your gym sessions lead to a reduction in pain, and stopping the gym sessions leads to the pain returning, then continue the gym sesions.
