A childish "that's so bad it couldn't have happened," becomes mixed with a slight racial angle "they would say that about good German people wouldn't they?"

Finally, sprinkle in a wimpish "but a well dressed man on YouTube said so and he seemed a good guy, he even told a joke or two. That would mean he's a liar. I can't buy that."

HOWEVER I want to discourage you from getting the R nineT scrambler as a first bike. There are a number of reasons it is inappropriate. The first reason is you really shouldn start on a machine with 100HP and 75lb ft of torque, that is enough to get you in a lot of trouble. Second is that without throwing guards on there, the cylinder heads are going to be the first point of contact when you inevitably drop or mishandle. Other common first bikes will get their handlebars or other parts down first before the engine, not this one. They also uncharacteristically raw bikes. They shake and shimmy and have no rider modes or ways of mitigating that power. Heck the model you like doesn even have a tachometer. I also not second guessing your financial situation, but by any measure nearly $14k is A LOT to spend on a first bike.

We don usually add anything else other than feta, but we do baste the rolls with egg yolks before we bake. We also pair it with a really simple cold soup or yogurt.

This problem now affects every other American and is the major driver of nearly all chronic disease and most our health care costs. Diabetes now sucks up one in three Medicare dollars.. 
I always felt it was a horrible notion that if you happened to commit an unforgivable sin, or if you happened to sin without having last rights, then you would be doomed to hell or purgatory. 
It is interesting that there is this group of shows such as Sazae san, Crayon Shin chan, Doraemon, etc that the Western fandom doesn really know about let alone cares a out and yet they are probably the most popular anime out there.

Ah I see. I think there's a flip side to this. How do you mean "better." Did more students matriculate to university? Or was there a lower rate of disobedience? Was the atmosphere more social inclusive? Or were there more opportunities available?
He actually thought you were going to just go along with his bullshit hell, he basically kidnapped you, took you to a strange place without telling you, and was going to talk you into doing whatever with him.

A huge element of It's A Wonderful Life is that Mr. Potter, the villainous bank owner, refuses to give loans to anyone who can't definitively prove they can afford them. Meanwhile, kindhearted protagonist George Bailey is willing to help members of his community by giving them loans they may struggle to repay so that they can live in a nice neighborhood rather than Potter's slums. After all, what's the worst that could happen?
Will you be providing refreshments?Just because you are hosting the tournament, doesn't mean it's your job to feed the group. There is nothing wrong with letting your guests know ahead of time that you will provide chips and sodas and that they are welcome to bring food items or beverages of their choosing. Or, ask everybody to pitch in $5 or $10 for food and then plan to order pizza and stock your fridge with sodas and beer..

Who made me murderous several times however was the utilities company here. Every single person there was difficult to work with. I was somewhat incompetent as well possibly, but they actively blocked attempts of getting together and sorting out the timelines, and there was a lot of chasing down information that needed to be done from my end.

""Advocates for a $15 minimum wage should look before they leap," said Ryan Young, a CEI fellow. "A higher minimum wage has real world tradeoffs. It is not a free benefit. A higher wage will force employers to reduce non wage pay such as insurance, breaks and personal time off, free meals or parking, and more. Why? Common sense tells you that when you raise the cost of something, anything, less of it will be used or consumed. It a fundamental precept of economics. And labor is no different. It is perhaps no coincidence that these three states have the highest state minimum wages in the nation. It an actual issue in place in the Middle East, as well as others. In America, women are NOT oppressed anymore. They have the same rights as men. There is no difference in pay for the same job. (The "72 Cents to a man dollar" stat is used incorrectly. It refers to the average earnings to all men and all women, and it NOT a reflection of actual wages. This is caused not by discrimination, but by the fact that men: Tend to work in physically demanding and dangerous jobs more than women (and these jobs tend to pay pretty well) and are generally more aggressive when negotiating raises. Also, stay at home moms are more prevalent than stay at home dads, so that means there are less women in the workforce.) 4 points  submitted 5 days ago

Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently. Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they fucking terrible animals.

His foray into cave rescue equipment gave me pause: there are a lot of operational considerations that experts in rescue work bring to bear. They train relentlessly on known apparatus, and a guy showing up with new kit brings so many unknowns. What if it gets stuck? Is there a checklist that everyone has drilled on? What are the oxygen and effort requirements on the divers? Asking experts to use a proof of concept (even on designed by rocket scientists) ignores a lot of he priorities and concerns those experts bring to bear on the situation.

A very recent visit to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre by the NHL old timers was indeed a day to remember as former NHL stars shared stories with Doug, and some even recalled Doug's glory days as a football star. The memory of Doug's broad grins and sheer joy from that day has been planted in our brains and will forever remain! Doug definitely lived life to the fullest. 
I say a lot of my live (and online fwiw) strategy is based on work I done with solvers, but it is still highly exploitative . People using solvers effectively aren using them to follow the equilibrium strat exactly, and the ones that are usually give up as its an overwhelming futile approach. Equilibrium, even pseudo equilibrium that a solver provides, is way too complicated to follow exactly. Despite this, using solvers to craft your strategy is a worthwhile endeavor. As you work more and more in a solver, patterns emerge. You develop an instinctive feel for how you should play and how villain should play given the range v. range interaction. As you start to see how far we deviate from equilibrium, your nodelocking work should help you understand how to best counter your opponents.

For example, if a character disordered person was undecided as to whether that want to close the deal on a partnership with someone, they will say, "well, we will have to sit down and discuss the details as to how we are going to split the profits, but they don't actually sit down and have the discussion, that way if they choose to pull out, they haven't been cornered into the deal or owe anything.

Most area runners know the Ali Dad story.

A hand containing an ace that is suited to another card in the hand is a good example of both scooping and redraw hands. You can win low with the ace, and you can win high with an ace high flush if your three suited cards hit on the board.

I can see why he went down that route. I think he was looking for validation in some specific technique or area of the act, but in your method to calm him, left a door open by referencing previous engagements. Also, "I would enjoy maybe 5 minutes" to be bluntly honest with you, as another guy, comes across as a lie. Sex takes way longer regardless of whether you drunk or sober.

Totally agree. The first half of the season (up til ep 6) had me pretty enthralled and I felt the pacing/writing was pretty on point. But since then there have been glaring plot holes and weird writing/pacing decisions and you can feel the drop in quality some episodes (esp 7 and 8 for me)..

Players reach equilibrium play by tracking regrets for past plays, making future plays proportional to positive regrets. 
Part of the problem may also be tight calves which can be released with a good deep tissue sports massage. This will help take some of the strain off the achilles tendon.

Post injection and this proportion slowly declined out to 120 h.At both 24 and 120 h, running resulted in an increase in the proportion of labeled leukocytes in the circulation.Analysis of the skeletal muscle, spleen and lung indicated that labeled leukocytes had accumulated in those tissues and were mobilized to the circulation in response to exercise.This indicates that there is an ongoing exchange of leukocytes between the circulation and tissues and that exercise can stimulate their redistribution.The modulatory effects of exercise on the immune system may be regulated in part by the systemic redistribution of immune cells..

Can enforce laws against any type of abuse to human, animals, plants, or water sentient lifeforms. This goes along with number 9. Nothing, I mean NOTHING, on this planet deserves to be tortured for anyone amusement. Just because humans think they are better doesn mean they are. Humans are destructive. Humans are mean. Humans need to get back to being peacemakers and lovers. We need to get back to respect. IF we need laws to remind people of that, then we need them. Common sense should prevail but sometimes it never does which is why we have laws that seem so comical. It is because people have forgotten common sense and humanity.

CITES alone protects roughly 5,600 species of animals and 30,000 species of plants. You would need a staff of a few hundred experts at every international airport and border crossing in the country.

After the last question in the series, assuming he answered all the previous questions correctly, is the answer "let item through", "inspect and let through", "collect paperwork and let through", or "deny entry".

Given that universities have been set "free" in the market to make a profit (or at least amass as large an endowment as possible), it might be time to "rationalize" the system.

LSD is a wonderful tool for introspection. Like other psychedelics, it causes you to think, and think, which is part of why some people can feel paranoid. But this is one of the two reasons I think that LSD is an amazing tool for growth, especially self growth. It encourages reflection, and helps make connections that you likely would not otherwise make. This is why LSD can be such a potent tool for understanding yourself, your past, your fears and desires, your mistakes, and so forth.

Its main use now is its a trading pair with all the alt coins that people want. Ethereum is getting more trading pairs now and closing in on bitcoin as one day other coins will be trading with any coin. Then bitcoins value will be pretty worthless when that day comes. But it will be awhile. Bitcoin has value now but in 10 to 20 years it wont have much imo. Bitcoin did start the crypto currency boom which now has many alt coins so a lot is owed to bitcoin. And it will be held as collectors item in the future so it will stay a little value based on the fact it got everything started. They really should make a etf for the altcoins not bitcoin imo. Then thats something I would definitely put a lot of money into.

I can explain the resident and her friend inquiry, the lights, nor the nurse experience with the apparition. The nurse and I feel that the resident may have accidentally tapped the TV Button on her bedside call light/switch box, but certainly added to the unnerving experience. The nurse and I documented the experience of the resident but leaving out the abnormalities of the lights, apparition, and other residents because quality of care did not change. She did ask the children about the patient earlier years to see if there is a history of trauma, but the children did not know of anything. The resident died about 8 or 9 months later without incident and life moved on. Something like this never happened again, but that wing did give me the willies for a couple of years after the event. The nurse did request for day shifts for a couple of weeks and then went back to nights. Thanks for reading.

While i won fully depreciate Bonds achievement as an outstanding baseball homerun hitter, i will underscore his choice in cheating to achieve Hank Aaron bona fide record. Whenever I think of Bonds now, I will always think of Rosie Ruiz Vivas who won the 84th Boston Marathon. The problem with Rosie is that she used a performance enhancing car ride to shave a couple of miles off of the race and then later jumped in from the crowd and sprinted to the finish. Should we be equally impressed? Not exactly an apple for apple, i agree but as far as cheating, where do we draw the line? Since when did hypodermic needles become okay in breaking records or winning? It not. It is flat out cheating. Mark McGuire is equally a cheat! Sure he got to take in the adulation of an adoring public for his cheating tactics. I hope both of these men can look themselves in the mirror and into the eyes of their children and feel justified that their essentially pulled a Rosie Ruiz with the American public. Thankfully, a majority of people do not condone this win at any means mentality. While i do realize that most of baseball and football and the Olympics over the past few decades have it not okay in my book. Look it up: Cheating characteristically is employed to create an unfair advantage, usually in one own interest, and often at the expense of others. To act dishonestly; practice fraud. To violate rules deliberately, as in a game.

If you watch the crowds at a sporting event, for example Rich Stadium, people may appear a little anxious but that's because of the start time. They may be anxious but they also look happy to be there and part of it all. At a game, visitors talk to each other as they stream in or out. They have a shared interest, they plan to be entertained and they look alive. It's the same for every other entertainment crowd concerts, festivals, rallies. People look intent but they are open, conversational and happy to be doing what they are doing.

With this much of your hand completed you should have enough information to determine whether to continue. If the flop does not fit your hand by giving you top pair, or better or a straight or flush draw, then you should fold if there is a bet in front of you. If you played a small pair from late position and you do not flop a third one to make a set you should throw the pair away if there is a bet.

A normal range of vitamin D is 30 to 74 ng/mL, but this can vary among laboratories.[8] Most experts agree that a concentration between 35 and 40 ng/mL is reasonable for preventive health. Some suggest that the optimal concentration for protecting against cancer and heart disease is between 50 and 70 ng/mL and up to 100 ng/mL. Side effects or toxicity can occur when blood concentrations reach 88 ng/mL or greater.[9] Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, sleepiness, and weakness.[6] Too much vitamin D can raise blood calcium concentrations, and acute toxicity causes hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.[6,9].

That doesn mean that I will eventually like all the things I hate now, just that I should always keep an open mind.

Hell, at some places merely exposing your hole cards with action pending kills your hand. At any place where the action is ambiguous, the dealer should get clarity from the player immediately to avoid a cluster fuck, though some fucks are bound to occasionally cluster..

I don't know why Smith repeatedly did this, because he gave the rounds away each time he did this. Many of the rounds were close until Smith would retreat to the ropes, where he'd get hit by a flurry of head shots from Abraham. Smith would try to cover up, but Abraham would throw a fast flurry of head shots that would often slice through the guard of Smith.

I have a giant comic book tattoo with oriental characters (read ninjas) and I themed it off of a Japanese woodblock, and those tend to have kanji in the background so I wanted that too, but I didn want it to say a damn thing. So I made the artist sketch up some fake looking kanji I then took it and showed it to a handful of people that know Mandarin, Korean, and Japanese, and they all said it was just a mixed up blob of crap. There isn a single real letter in it, let alone a dumb word or embarrassing concept..

That actually not bad for a soldier, especially if you plan on mostly using melee weapons (particularly the Prototype Vibroblade at your stage). Strength and Constitution are your most important attributes if you plan on going the melee route, and the +2 from 14 dex is a pretty solid place to be if you want to use armor   it can go higher but if you want to wear any heavy stuff it be wasted.

I don think there anything wrong with you feeling thrilled by what happened. You chased off a sexual competitor. That pretty primal embedded in our DNA stuff. If he does end up backing off because of this and you are able to forgive and forget, then I don think you have anything to worry about. If you suddenly learned that you get a rush from causing pain to others and start seeking it out every chance you get, well then maybe you have a problem.

The catch for Zynga is that the Facebook gravy train may not last forever, and the company will eventually need more distribution partners. and Facebook will continue to exist in a relationship of cooperative competition, according to Werbach. can afford to put all its eggs in Facebook basket, but neither can it live without the enormous push that it gets from its Facebook relationship. which recently launched a new social network called Google+ to compete with Facebook, would seem to be a natural diversification option for Zynga. However, Zynga would still be dependent on what Clemons calls parallel monopolies. that in five years, the world is 50% Google and 50% Facebook, Clemons says. will still need both. Half of its revenues go away if it gets into a fight with either. Distribution does not diversify as easily as other resources. 2010, Zynga cut a distribution deal with Yahoo to feature games, including poker, FishVille and Mafia Wars, on the search engine games channel. The company has not disclosed revenue generated from the Yahoo partnership. In its broadest global diversification move to date, Zynga on July 26 announced that it has partnered with Tencent, one of China top Internet service providers. The move could give Zynga a much broader reach and keep the company Facebook deal intact because the social network does not operate in China.

She may be a great person/smoking hot/out of your league, but she isn't likely great enough for anyone, including you, to sacrifice their twenties and thirties for (as well as the dreams you might have of having stable minded kids of your own). Be prepared, though, for her to raise hell if you try to back out. She is probably feeling lucky as hell to have found you (since no other guy would likely tolerate even a fraction of what you have) and when she knows she's about to lose you, there may be no limits to what she says or does to keep you around.

Tutorials or lack thereof is a great point as well. They were also the thorn that broke the camel back in Lawbreakers, they were implemented way too late, after most new players had moved on.

This is definitely more of a question for the religious studies field, because they deal precisely with the question "what is religion?" Whereas history in general is the study of the past, of which religion is a facet, if they choose to define it at all. "how close are these rituals to Christianity?" The more close, the more it "counts" as a religion, the further away, the less, etc.)

The Sanctuary Salonspa combines beauty and relaxation in perfect harmony. In addition to cutting and coloring your locks, the staff offers a wide range of massage services including hot stone massage, pregnancy massage, and Lomi Lomi, plus facials, waxing, body treatments, and more. The friendly and talented staff greets patrons at the door and immediately begins the pampering process. In their capable hands (figuratively and literally), Sanctuary's customers receive one on one attention in the warmly lighted space. The spa's stress free environment serves as a brief but rewarding getaway after a long day or week of work. But Sanctuary's true mark of excellence is how the staff treats the boyfriends, husbands, and friends who are just there for company. At Sanctuary they're not relegated to sitting in a cramped waiting room while their partners are being pampered. Non customers can relax by the cozy fireplace, drink fresh coffee or tea, and gaze at a variety of birds munching on feeders in the backyard. When the massages and facials are over, everybody, even those who didn't partake in the services, goes home relaxed.

The original version of craps contained a flaw where people could actually win. The sarcastically named John Winn introduced a new rule that fixed the hell out of that.

On the other hand, if the same patient decided to have salad for lunch with a cold glass of milk, the cold and damp nature of this meal would make the wind cold condition much worse. Any herbal therapy administered at this point would be much less effective, since the therapy first needs to overcome the negative effect of the food before dealing with the acute ailment. For this reason, a patient is always advised about which foods could exacerbate the imbalance and which will help restore balance..

Steve King should have been removed years ago, but demonizing the people that voted for him will not win them to your side. That is what I am trying to point out. Most people are not even informed enough to know that they were voting for a racist, what they saw were things that effected them directly, like jobs, subsidies, etc. Most people aren evil, but they are often willing to turn a blind eye when it is not effecting them and theirs. That does not mean you call them evil, you just have to convince them why it is in their best interest. The left has stopped doing that well, and it shows in Iowa specifically. Iowa was blue until just, what, 2 years ago? 4?

This sounds very similar to me, though I wasn in health care. I left a big 4 subsidiary to work at a Cozy Co (CC). My base was higher at CC but overall compensation was much lower RSUs. CC was a nice company, often rated a really great one to work for in my town. Lots of developers loved it and had been there for 5 10 years. Exercise room, yoga classes, really good coffee, all that jazz. I found it not satisfying at all. I missed the excitement of a faster paced place.

According to Balfour Lynn's literature review, studies dating back to 1948 have indicated that there's no link between milk and phlegm, but a 2003 study in the journal Appetite asked 345 random Australian shoppers whether they thought milk causes mucus. Of the 111 shoppers who drank whole milk, almost half of them were of the opinion that it did. Only 25 percent of the 121 reduced fat milk drinkers said they believed milk caused mucus. The difference in perception might have something to do with how milk feels in the mouth   it is, after all, just droplets of fat suspended in water.

First you should decide what sort of poker are you going to tackle first. Two player hold'em is pretty much solved, though the best humans still put up a real fight with the best AI's available. The AI has the main advantages over humans by having an unlimited flawless memory of past hands, flawless analysis of the patterns based on that and as they are machines, they don't tilt like almost all humans occasionally do..
