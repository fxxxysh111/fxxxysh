If I want to take another trip for $1/$3, I will definitely be headed back to MGM National Harbor, although, again, I don expect to ever have as good of results at these stakes again. I won $3500 which is just $100 shy of 12 buyins! But coincidentally, this trip put my live poker earnings over $15,000 and I now have enough "winnings" to move up to $2/$5 or $5/$5. I didn get the impression that this area was necessarily the best spot for those stakes, but I DO think it would be better than most places. I think LA would probably be the best place to go specifically for a $5 big blind, and I want to plan a mini trip there to test those waters.

A few years ago some investment bankers called me to ask for my "expert" opinion on investing in the cosmetic surgery industry. I am an "expert" by virtue of writing a book on cosmetic surgery and, more importantly, having been quoted as an expert in the New York Times. I told them, I thought rather wisely, to forget about it. I told them that the entire industry was predicated on high interest medical loans and would collapse under the weight of its own greed. I thought I was incredibly prescient. Turns out I was just wrong, or at least wrong about one of the possible investments: Botox.

When men are in their 40s the prostate begins to grow, leading to increasing resistance to the bladder's ability to empty.

I gathered from the tone of his Urdu language question that he was asking if I was from Pakistan. 
I personally do not think children out of wedlock is bad or being single parent is bad or the wrong choice (I grew up in a household with a single parent that earned and functioned while the other one was drunk and mostly passed out) but for such a position, one should be financially secure when they decide to bring a life into this world and not have to rely (unless just dumb luck) on social insurance and child support etc. 2 points  submitted 2 days ago.

My deep, deep concern is my other housemate, Lilly Bee, our one year old Malagasy Coton de Tulear.

In working for a Pakistani employer, I also spoken to more than one Pakistani adolescent who professed sympathy for ISIS, and specifically their practice of throwing homosexuals from a high location.

I personally like to see her old beam returning but only locking to shields (and possibly HP shields too). Maybe they could leave this damage but add more benefits from charging your weapon, such as more ammo recovered, possibly a lifesteal to her shield HP and making your M2 stronger. However we need a different M2 I guess. 
One dumbass move a guy did was he steals some poor girls car. 
We ask ourselves questions about our hero life all the time. Who is the protagonist? What employment is he/she in? All kinds of questions and we build that character to really great heights, but what about our bad guy? I can remember ever reading a book that really focuses on that bad guy. Oh we get whiffs of him or her but do we ever really get to know that person? People say all the time about serial murders that they never expected that guy or that neighbor to be like that. 
So if you could make a Thursday newbie run it might be a better experience. I would have to prep you more (via email) than I would on a normal difficulty run. And I would have to provide your tokens for your build (which I can do for you, or work with you on via email). None of that is a problem, it is just more prep work on your end.

For Marx it was about the transition of society, from the hunter gatherer lifestyle to agriculture to feudalism to capitalism then to communism. In his mind, Capitalism was the current stage. It had replaced Feudalism because the merchant and banking classes began to rise in wealth and power displacing the nobles, and as such society changed to match that, becoming a democratic republic in the process of adopting republican ideals. 
Another solution to this problem is to simply allow concealed carry permit holders to carry their guns everywhere, so they don't have to stow them be their vehicles. Since this demographic has the single lowest instance of crime out of all those who possess guns, even less than police, this would be more reasonable than leaving the guns to be stolen by these poor kids who really didn't even have a choice but to steal the guns.

The All in bet" allows a player to bet the amount of money they have left on the table and prevents the opponent from raising the bet.

The whole cycle described here can take 20 minutes, or it can take one or more hours. If you have never meditated before, then try 2 or 3 minutes of movement, followed by 5 minutes or so of meditation and a couple of minutes bringing yourself back to the here and now. So, when you begin, you are spending about 10 minutes on the cycle. As you learn to enjoy it, the amount of time you meditate will naturally increase.

Oh dear! I think you may have read my first comment wrong, I do not have double standards, I never outright said it was a horrible racist thing I just meant it was rude and kind of mean towards the race OP was, this is because in her example she gave, the comment was not "I not usually attracted to people of your race" and instead "you are attractive for a member of your race" which implies they believe that OP race is ugly or bad, rather then that they just have a preference (which is fine, you don need to be attracted to everyone) and when you imagine it in a scenario, saying something like (and I just using this ethnicity as an example) "your hot! for an asian." rather than "I not usually attracted to asians but I think you hot" is a bit rude.

It must feel great to be naked and not care at all, given what his life is like. It probably be great for most of us since, from wearing clothes daily forever, many grow a certain embarrassment about being naked which they later conflate with an embarrassment of our figure.

The move add to pressure on the gambling industry, which already faces a government clampdown on lucrative fixed odds betting terminals. The sports minister Tracey Crouch resigned last week over a delay in plans to slash the maximum stake allowed by such machines from 50 to 2.

For the most part I been assuming you looking at DoD related jobs in this area that require a security clearance (mostly likely collateral Secret, but possibly more restrictive.) The ability to hold a clearance is worth something, and holding an active clearance is worth a premium. If you are, for whatever reason, unable to hold a clearance, there are still other software engineering roles in the area, but they may not pay quite as much. Some roles at ADTRAN et al pay similarly to what I described above because they compete with cleared contractor roles for talent; others are not. To safely earn above $80k as a software engineer without worrying about a security clearance you would probably have to move somewhere else in the country.

Bissonnette, 76, of Waltham, was first exposed to what she sees as a common precursor to homelessness in the 1950s while working at the Little Company of Mary Hospital in East Cambridge, which cared for patients with chronic diseases, until it closed in 1959. Bissonnette said she and the staff regularly encountered people who arrived with no hope to live and watched them convalesce. But when it came time to leave, Bissonnette said, the steep hospital fees had emptied their savings, leaving them unable to afford a home..

By law, we could not inform his employer that he was under investigation; only if and when actual charges were filed. We could be sued for harassment. So this guy went about his business as a teacher to this day.

The stranger rapist knocking you out in an alley is pretty much a myth; it will almost always be someone you know  so who do you know? Your coworkers or boss, where reporting it might get you fired? A boyfriend or a friend, where you know you be tearing apart your friend circle and support system (and you might see the rapist, still, as a friend you don want to put in jail, because it hard to change your view of someone as friend into nemesis overnight)? Maybe a family member, and you be tearing your family apart? Regardless of who it was, it can also feel like now everyone knows one of the worst things that happened to you, an incredibly intimate and private thing, and now is treating you differently when you just want things to be normal..

The CRA also reassessed the 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years in which the taxpayer claimed child care expenses of $4,800, $4,000 and $5,245, respectively. Normally, these tax years would be considered since the CRA is generally prohibited from reassessing a taxpayer more than three years after the original reassessment unless it can be shown the taxpayer a misrepresentation in filing her returns for these years that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. Judge concluded the taxpayer not pay the amounts for childcare she claimed she paid in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and that she therefore made a misrepresentation in her tax returns.

The wrong part is obvious: the government trying to control advertising could not possibly be a good idea. If ice cream is made to look creamier, does that count? Are we just talking bodies? If so, what "unrealistic" airbrushing and what "necessary"? If I have a photo taken and there a large, visible zit on my chin, can I ask the photographer to take it off?

If atomic decay were happening at 1000x the speed it happens today, it also going to be producing 1000x the heat.And that amount of heat would cook the Earth.Cepitore  4 points  submitted 9 days agoHow much extra heat would be produced if the decay rate was going at an increased rate for roughly 6 months? Also consider that the objective of the flood was to destroy the planet, so there would be a certain level of catastrophic heat that would still fit the narrative.This is all hypothetical, so if we are assuming there is something wrong with radiometric dating data, we couldn't even be sure that pressure was the sole cause of inflated dating calculations so we can't just chalk it all up as 100% due to increased decay rate.My point is, under these hypothetical assumptions, we don't know how much of the misinterpreted data is due to inconsistent decay, and therefore it's tough to guess how much heat the process produced.The main question is still, can pressure possibly alter decay rate? If yes, how much does it take, and if no, why?We just had a treatment on /r/debateevolution that attempted to put a number on this: they took the current heat gradient due to isotopic decay heat, and rolled it backwards to produce the numbers for a 6000 year old Earth assuming we got the decay rates wrong.This isn quite the scenario you asked about, but it fairly similar: instead of a one off event, it a constant rate change, so your scenario would produce a far higher peak temperature; it would still release the same amount of energy over time, so your 6 month scenario would be several thousand times hotter than this.Anyway, 1km underground would be 10x as hot as the sun, which I suggest is probably wrong.

The tips you have provided are good and applicable in a lot of ways.

Eh, I disagree to an extent. Could time management have been better? Sure. But we were also down by 2 points with over 9 minutes left. It took us over 7 minutes to score there. We needed to come away with a touchdown as a field goal would have given Brady time for a quick drive to only field goal range. Much easier to get into field goal range than scoring a touchdown.

On a serene Tuesday evening, as the sun begins to set and the clouds reflect an ethereal glow from city lights, crowds congregate at the Vincennes racetrack just outside Paris. Proud horse owners, the bourgeoisie families gather on the indoor balconies of the hippodrome for dinner as they follow the races with binoculars. Parisian locals, mostly aging lower to middle income laborers and salary men, congregate on the outdoor stands and pore over the plethora of statistics available for each race. They ardently debate each horse genealogical lineage, the performance of the jockeys, the quality of the trainers, the condition of the turf, and whether horseshoes should be worn on the front hoofs, the hind hoofs or not at all. No detail is too trivial to be factored into a bettor secret recipe for selecting the winning horse.
Perhaps the American Dream made sense before the 1980s, when wealth in the US was increasing for all 5 income levels, but the dream turned into dementia as Reaganomics took holdThe deregulation of banking alongside an economic policy of giving money to the rich and simultaneously slashing the social safety net and destroying labor meant that the rich got richer and everyone else (80%) became poorer. According to a study by the American Political Science Association, by 1990, the US had the most unequal income distribution of any industrialized countryAnd yet Americans kept on dreaming. 
Both sides didn't create this problem. The GOP as a whole has become far more radicalized since 2000, and especially after 2008.

The GOP keeps making far right demands while accepting no compromise.

Sounds pretty awesome. I'm glad it had good outcomes for your unit. Although I have to ask, if you've never failed, presumably you're in good shape and plan to keep that way, and don't plan to fail, why all the anxiety? Not trying to sound like a dick or anything, just hoping to see if you realize you probably don't need to be getting so stressed out over something that's obviously not an issue. If you've never failed and never plan to fail, then I don't see what the anxiety is for, since it serves only to deflate you. 8 points  submitted 3 days ago

So, imagine a poor black kid from Brooklyn who never knew the value of dollar and suddenly is given a 1 million in cash to spend and when it comes to the other 29 millions for the fight, Don was taking his piece of 1/3, and 2/3 were divided between Tyson's managers (John Horne) and his team.

Also fun fact that I not sure is true or not but I been hearing since my friends and I listened to this in high school: Apparently the lead singer of this band was the guy that the lead singer of Brand New girlfriend cheated with. So Adam (TBS singer) stole Jesse (Brand New singer) girl and they both hated each other. It also means at least the first two albums by TBS and Brand New are about the same girl!

I will use an analogy, obviously not identical, but just to make my point.

If the news reported that I was foolishly not wearing a helmet, wouldn that seem like they were a little biased? Doesn it seem to remove some responsibility from the person who fired the nail?.

It's funny how people take Pride week so seriously, yet all they are doing is getting wasted for a week straight (at least here in NYC). Of all the people I've seen and known to get incredibly riled up over it and serious about attending, those are the ones who don't do anything other than party. They're not working for LGBT organizations, they're not helping to raise awareness or seek donations for any kind of charity, they aren't performing or speaking in public or helping organize it in some way, etc. Those people are usually pretty fine with whether or not you attend or celebrate, they got important work they are doing. It's just the most indulgent people who take offense to any other gay person saying they'd rather stay home or do something else than march in a parade or go to a pride party.

In a suburban style house seven miles south of town, surrounded by two acres of lawn and a swimming pool, Detective Captain Dennis Smith of the Ada police force was at home with his wife, Sandi. They were planning to go to bed early, because they had to get up early the next morning. Though a veteran of eighteen years on the police force, the detective supplemented his income with a paper route. Every morning, seven days a week, he and Sandi, who worked as a building inspector for the city, started their day by driving around town delivering 650 copies of the Daily Oklahoman, out of Oklahoma City, the largest newspaper in the state. Sandi would drive the family car while the detective, a stocky, sturdily built man, bald almost in the manner of television's Kojak, hurled the rolled up newspapers onto the lawns of subscribers. Getting up early wasn't fun; tonight, because the clocks would be moved forward, they would get even less sleep than usual.

Most game historians disagree with the above and state that poker is from an 18th century French game called "Poque", and yet others reference a German game that involved bluffing called "pochspiel" and some even say it is derived from the Hindu word "pukka". The opinions continue with some referencing the word poker came from an underworld slang word "poke" a term used for pickpockets and "hocus pocus" the term popularised by magicians. There is no clear links and no definitive answer; it is safe to say modern day poker arrived from an amalgamation of many different games and words.

To say that it is true John believes p is to say that John entertains some set of logically possible worlds, where those worlds are compatible with what he believes to be true. These worlds don literally exist, but we can treat them as if they do for the purposes of evaluating propositions. We can paraphrase, then:

Saturday evening's Class 4A boys basketball state championship game was billed as a clash between two powerhouses that have spent the past calendar year on a collision course toward one another.

June 7: Facebook finds a "bug" that changed 14 million people's privacy settings.

Any discussion of muscle building foods requires a spotlight on meat. Sure, all ten foods could be derived from animals (beef, buffalo, bison, elk, venison, lamb, ostrich, turkey, fish, and eggs) but that would be boring and unpractical for many of you who aren't avid wild game hunters. Still, there is abundant evidence that meat provides a better quality protein for the body to use for muscle building and optimal anabolic hormone function.
Oh the other hand, from an exploitative standpoint it might make sense to bet bigger for pure value so that you can set up a shove by the river, whereas you would have made a small bet with your bluffs.

The next step to handling your receipts is to have a physical ledger and a backup, such as a computer software program that can document the receipts. By doing this, you have a primary means of logging the income and expenses that you have, and you have a backup system in case something happens to the primary method. When dealing with your own company, regardless of what you sell, it is absolutely essential to keep accurate and duplicate records. This is especially true when it comes to contending with receipts for that business.

The clarinet is easy to get a tune out of and is a good introduction to woodwinds generally. But to play the clarinet well, you need to strengthen the muscles around your lips. This can only be done by practice, so a clarinet player needs to practise every day for at least 15 minutes. 30 would be better. Every day that you don't practise is a step backward as your lips will get flabby.

The first player uses the three of clubs in their first hand. After that, the next player can play anything ranked higher than the last hand. If the player put a single card, the following players must play single cards until the round is over. If they put pairs, everyone has to play pairs until the round is over. If they play a five card hand, however, the players following them must play a five card hand. Each play should be higher than the last, meaning if I put a full house with three nines, a player can beat my hand with a full house with three cards higher than a nine or a four of a kind.
