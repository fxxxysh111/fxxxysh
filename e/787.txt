While in the late stages of the rush poker tournament you will need to know there are 2 types of players. First the players that are going after the win.

Hands end in one of three ways: one person bets and everyone else folds, one person bets on the final round and at least one person calls, or everybody checks on the final round. If everybody folds to a bet, the bettor need not show the winning cards and will usually toss them to the dealer face down. If somebody calls on the end, the person who bet or raised most recently is supposed to immediately show, or "open", their cards. They may delay doing so in a rude attempt to induce another player to show their hand in impatience, and then muck their own hand if it is not a winner. Don't do this yourself. Show your hand immediately if you get called. If you have called a bet, wait for the bettor to show, then show your own hand if it's better. If the final round is checked down, in most card rooms. everyone is supposed to open their hands immediately. Sometimes everyone will wait for someone else to show first, resulting in a time wasting deadlock. Break the chain and show your cards.

Your first statement is really a common paradigm that people fall for. Poker doesn really work that way. In theory you supposed to bet less on each street. On the flop typically you want to have 2 bluffs for every 1 value bet. 1:1 on the turn, and 2 value bets for every bluff on the river to be at equilibrium and to make your opponent indifferent to bluff catching. So hes going to fire every value bet on the flop and X number of bluffs. The turn is a brick but that doesnt mean hes going to continue to barrel with every bluff he used on the flop and in this formation I think hes lacking in bluffs in his preflop range. On the other side almost no players are going to check back value here. So to answer your question I calling on the flop because I not always facing another turn barrel. Our hand performs significantly worse vs bet flop and turn compared to bet flop check turn.

Or, since it is notarized, is it possible to take the degree into the Chinese consulate in Seoul and get it authenticated that way instead?

Like the flop bet, can prob size up a bit to pot. Good hand to barrel when FD bricks. Would fold to flop raise though. You have enough hands to defend against this already and don't have odds to call ur gut shot. Also from an exploitative standpoint alarm bells should be ringing when most people raise this flop vs PFA multi way. As played x/jam on turn vs aggro regs is prob fine. Be careful Vs fish and weaker regs when it comes to weaving bluffs into lines like this tho were villian is often too value heavy/stationy. Depending on ur stakes u often dont have enough FE here vs population for this to be profitable

Yes, it was a paradigm shift in the franchise, but there is zero reason to separate it from its franchise kin, especially when it is a superior game to all those that came before it.

First of all if you have a kid and aren't prepared for them to turn out different than what you perceive as the "default", reconsider your life and your expectations of other people.

As a former middle school teacher, I hated hearing from certain students that their parents didn care, have any consequences, or practically rewarded them for their bad behavior in class.

Online poker can be sustained simply because fish lose money too quickly when the skill disparity is so great, especially at higher limits.

If you mismanage degenerative tendinopathy in an NBA athlete, especially quadriceps tendinosis, you can have very bad things happen. An example of this is Blake Griffin. The quad injury that kept Blake sidelined the majority of the 2015 2016 season and playoffs was degenerative tendinopathy of the quadriceps that was mismanaged and led to a partial rupture of the quadriceps tendon. Even with rehabbing this injury, Blake has lost some of his explosiveness and is still at very high risk to re injure that tendon.

One reporter brought up the interesting point that "there a responsibility for countries to take these people back and that they . stand trial and face justice in their own countries because . it could be a national security threat to actually leave them in these camps where they could be radicalized and, you know, left to languish with a very uncertain future." essentially, though isis is on the verge of defeat, leaving these people for dead instead of repatriating them and having them stand trial can be viewed as setting ripe conditions for more extremist islamic activity. repatriating these women and imprisoning them is an option worth considering as opposed to just repatriating them with a slap on the wrist.

I was on a family vacation to Atlanta, about 1972. We went to visit some cousins of my grandmothers. Twin sisters, never married, in their 80 The house was in a rundown neighbourhood. From the street you think it was abandoned. Overgrown yard, part of the roof caved in, boarded up windows. Inside, it was all antiques, and furniture from the 30 and 40 slowly deteriorating, and it looked as though they hadn dusted in years. Wallpaper pealing, old portraits half fallen. Looking up to the second floor from the stairs, just cobwebs and collapsed ceilings. They said they hadn been up their in years. And definitely rat noises. They both looked and lived like ghosts, and seemed half mad, very civil and proper but off. As an 8 year old, I was terrified, especially when one of them joked and said "You should leave him here. He can live with us". I burst into tears, and we left.

Hey everyone, please delete if not allowed :) I have a friend who joined the gym about a year ago and he used to be quite skinny, but now he has gained a fair amount of muscle. We went out for breakfast and he ordered two sets of individual pancake meals. He also just eats a lot of whatever, even if it's not necessarily good for him. My question is basically, when people talk about nutrition as it pertains to muscle gain, it seems that there are certain kinds of foods someone should eat. How come so many dudes 'bulk' and just eat anything, even if it's considered 'unhealthy'? Can a female go about this in the same way? I'm in the process of starting to build my body up and I'm pretty small (52 kg female) but all my research indicates that you can't just eat whatever you want to bulk up.

Then, with a dramatic pause accompanied by a look of apprehension and a caress of his imaginary chin beard, he pointed instead to the Florentine Chicken Crepe, suggesting it would be an absolute shame to miss the chef's delectable cream sauce.Though he had our mouths watering in anticipation, he switched gears again and spent the next minute waffling between the Florentine and the Neo Seoul, an eclectic crepe package filled with shredded barbeque pork and kimchi.It's clear that A Cafe is trying to put a fresh spin on an old menu favorite. Inventive and unique crepe fillings, along with enticing baguette sandwiches and Parisian inspired starters, pepper the new and improved menu at A Cafe, formerly Arlene's Creperie Bistro and, before that, Crepes a la Carte on Broadway in Boulder.Along with the menu revamp, you'll find sweeping changes inside A Cafe.An ambitious makeover has transformed the once nondescript crepe joint into a quaint, cozy, Parisian style cafe complete with chandeliers, exposed brick, hobnail framed mirrors and woven rattan bistro armchairs.

Mark "Pee Wee Herman" Frost, Mike "Englebert Humperdink" Stabbins, Tony "Spikey" Hake and Phil "The Mad Professor" Owen were just some of the elegant styles on display as we greeted our opponents for the evening. The rules were quickly amended to allow everyone to play and we decided on a six hands per team with the sixth hand played man for man for beer. Puddletown took an early lead on the first hand but were pegged back on the second to be only 6 pins ahead. The third hand would see something special from the Wanderers. Just as Skipper Hake hit the first team spare outside of Somerset last year, Food Chain Phil hit the first flopper outside of Somerset, to rapturous cheers applause and man hugs from the usual suspects. We were still in the hunt after four hands. Man In Beige Stabbins was also doing well, despite insisting on his run up. At least the doors stayed shut this year! The threat of any player (home or away) hitting six and under would be "gelled" seemed to affect the home team more as they struggled to find any sort of score. Skipper Hake came good on the fifth hand with a spare, although how he did it nobody knew as he seemed to be on auto pilot! At least the home spectators at the back were treated to Tony's arse cleavage show!! After the beer hands it became apparant that the Wanderers despite being worse for wear after a day on the drink and playing on a very short and unfamiliar alley, had amazingly run out winners by 3 pins.

Where Did They Come From?Crocs started life at sea as a deck shoe   hence the holes and the non slip soles. Their genesis is a business fairytale: in July, 2002 three men on a Caribbean sailing trip fantasised about a pair of shoes that was slip proof, waterproof, comfortable, fun, smell free and didn't leave marks. So they decided to make them. Following their initial success with boat users, Crocs were adopted by hospital workers because they could be easily sterilised, and by those in the catering industry and other professions who were on their feet all day because of their comfort. Crocs' rise to fame was somewhat meteoric, relying as it did on word of mouth alone in the early days. By 2007 they were a fashion craze and their presence on the high street became ubiquitous.

Outside of trauma, the body maintained a wonderfully effective selective barrier in the small intestine, one that allowed nutrients to enter, but kept out metabolic wastes and microbial toxins rampant in the intestines. Since the 50s and 60s, antibiotic use has been frantically prescribed for every infection and inflammation, particularly pediatric ear infection, bronchitis, and sore throat.It is sadly ironic that most of these infections are viral in nature, and not only are the antibiotics damaging, but they are ultimately unnecessary.
