Don Eat in Front of Customers Never eat in front of a customer, or eat while talking with a customer on the phone.

"If operators open and close the machines an hour later or earlier then that is a little thing they can do to help people who need help. "If the ATMS are further away then hopefully that break from sitting at the machine will make gamblers think, 'do I really want to take that extra $100 out or should I walk away?'." Cr Moran said he hoped other councillors supported the decision because he was trying to help gamblers as well as gamblers' familiesfrom suffering.

Final table was gonna be of 9 people. So we were all still in 2 separate tables. I knocked out 3 guys, and I got up to 5000 chips including my 1000 new chips. We moved to the final table. Everything was going fine, until I got pocket 8 I checked. The flop was 8,J,4. I checked again. The guy next to me said raise 400. Everybody folds. I say all in. He called instantly. I flip my 2 8 and get up. I know if I win this, I am the chip leader. I get up and everybody is saying "Oh he hit a set. Nice". And the guy turns 2 J We both hit a set on the turn with pocket pairs. He could not cover me but I went down to less than 1k. Then I got somebody else out on a pair but I was barely at 1.8K chips which were very less. We were last 7 players. The bubble according to the rule was 5 players. I did not know that the table can decide to change that if they all agree. I went all in before the flop on AJ suited. The other guy who called me (Almost same chips, he had 100 more when we checked) had A9 unsuited. He hit a 9 pair on the turn or river.

Although it is possible your fingerboard is warping, there should be a curve to your board, just about how you described it. A board with no curve to it is more likely to buzz. If you want to post a pic with the straightedge against the board so I can see the dip, it will help confirm, but it more likely that the temperature and humidity changes between summer and winter have brought the neck angle up, and that why the bridge seems low. If it a regular problem, you might look into getting a summer bridge and a winter bridge and switching them out as need be.

So they called us in a little while later and showed us the images of the scans and discussed every minor detail with us. I must say, if we had any doubts about their competence before we left home, the doubts have been completely replaced with confidence.

Let's not invalidate people being sexually harassed or taken advantage of just because they happen to be 18. That's a pretty shitty thing to do to other people.

I came away from Thinking in Bets with a robust toolset, including a system for making calibrated predictions, an approach to evaluating outcomes, and an overview of cognitive pitfalls.

No, I left it on. I had enough room to get her into the pack and play on the open side. As she got longer, I would usually lay her horizontal in the pack and play, and either her feet or head would be on the same side as the changer, but it was so far away from her face (and hands), I didn't think it was necessary to take it off. I dropped the mattress as soon as she gave any signs she was rolling, so I never worried she would grab the changer.
Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

C'est sans doute regrettable, mais c'est ainsi. Les personnages officiels, blanc bleu, admirs et honors par la bourgeoisie bon chic bon genre, suscitent rarement la ferveur. On les respecte, on les honore, mais la ferveur, elle, est le privilge des irrguliers, des scandaleux, des maudits. Si le Bon Dieu existe, il aura illico accueilli Simone Veil dans son paradis, j'en suis certain, mais le charmeur, l'enchanteur, le tentateur, ce n'est pas Dieu, c'est le Diable.

But, in this modern and unarguably unsustainable economy, there is a strong correlation between the amount of money spent on something, and the CO2 emissions required to build that thing from scratch, with a few exceptions (buying a forest to preserve it, investing in steadily improving next generation solar and battery technologies).

This is exactly what happening now with the whole misgendering issue, you forcing people to accept that someone has changed genders simply because they said they did. It works both ways. This is why misgendering shouldnt have it own rule and should just fall under targeted harrassment.

Player 1 loses but gets back $100, and they play out the next hand for the remaining $200 ($100 from player 1 and $100 from player 2) in the pot.

Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss Everdeen, winner of the 74th annual Hunger Games, in this sequel based on the best selling series of books. President Snow (Sutherland) is upset by the rebellion that has started through the victory Katniss and Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson) achieved in the first film.

Naturally, Katniss and Peeta are selected, and they'll have to fight for their lives again, this time taking on the best of the best from previous Hunger Games.

How can you deliberately kill somebody who isn even born for over 100 years after you die?! In my opinion, murder is carried out by the living, or maybe very rarely the very recently deceased in the case of some kind of deliberate, delayed explosion or something.

(I owned a golden before and thought I knew how to take care of dogs, LOL)  within 5 minutes of the first google search I turned to my wife and said "we have made a terrible mistake." omg, fencing, walking, running, turning her into a sled dog (because she can go to dog parks because she eats little dogs), she also pulls me on a bike and we are learning to do skiing, now  she escapes, she howls, she jumps, she pulls, she is the worst dog. We love her so much and I still can believe how much work she is  I have four kids and my dog demands more personal attention every day than my kids do; and will destroy the house if it is not given. If you do not have about 90 minutes a day for walks, loves, treats, whatever, you do not have enough time for your husky. Had her for four years now, she awesome, but when she dies there will be zero chance I will have the energy for another one. She sits right now, as I type, looking at me  she just picked her head up  I think its time for a walk. Tons of snow, so it will be a good one.

In the narcissist view, they are wonderful parents, but you are the problem, you are "wild," you are impossible, you are "terrible"  all because you are standing up to them, and not subscribing to their delusional view of themselves.

Short of spending six figures on something ultra high end, I can't think of another interior that's quite so opulent.

For many individuals, it is very important for them to protect their privacy, while others are simply concerned that buyers will make assumptions about them and judge them instead of simply judging their home.

My wife and I attended the funeral of a guy we had played poker with for years. I mean, 4 nights a week for 6 years! When we walked in and went to sign the guest book, my wife suddenly got a case of the giggles, out of nowhere! Now, we had spent a lot of time around this dude, and laughed a lot with the guy over the years, but his family was mortified. I had to walk my wife out, through his entire family, while she was laughing so hard she was snorting and crying. Good times. A few weeks later, we received a thank you note from the family for being at the memorial service. RIP, Mr. In the 15 years I've been riding, I've logged over 100k miles and two cross country trips. I also almost lost my life when a woman hit me last year, totaling my Fat Bob and landing me in the ICU for a week. But even if I hadn't done any of this, it wouldn't matter. I'm doing me. You're the one triggered by some dude's SoA keychain. That, to me, sounds like the lowest common denominator of butthurt.

But how do you propose we welcome the types of young men who are inclined towards MRA? They generally support it because of some sense of the very specific feeling of victimization that is emasculation, so trying to show them that the wealthy elites are the ones hurting them won really do anything. They simply are socialized to think that masculinity has some set of characteristics and must be protected first and foremost, and destruction of masculinity is and must be a core value of leftism.

Fair enough for trying to justify his selection but this is clutching at straws, even if we pretend that euro tour/floor events don count towards selection and that the World Series is remotely relevant then you can just say that Barney reaching the semi of some random exbo event in Australia has the same weighting as Whitlock reaching a ranked TV major final. Hypothetically speaking should someone reaching the World Championship + World Matchplay finals yet losing in the first round of two world series events count for the same as reaching the final of two world series events but losing in the first round of the World Champs and Matchplay? No of course not, but your scoring system grants those achievements equal weighting..

Focus more on the human side of management. In his 1996 article, "The Human Side of Management", Thomas Teal noted that "mediocre management is the norm" and that one reason for this is that "in educating and training managers, we focus too much on technical proficiency and too little on character But we're still in the Dark Ages when it comes to teaching people how to behave like great managers   somehow instilling in them capacities such as courage and integrity that can't be taught. Perhaps as a consequence, we've developed a tendency to downplay the importance of the human element in managing." Twenty years later, this still rings true. Poor management demoralises people and ultimately takes a toll on performance. At a minimum, perhaps we should have everyone read Bob Sutton's first book, on building a civilised workplace and his second one on surviving one that isn't.

However, you need only to glance at the snowflakes on an officemate's shoulders or your own limp, lifeless locks in the mirror to realize that unhealthy scalps are a problem. A damaged scalp can be itchy and flaky or oily and scaly. In severe cases, a person may develop scalp sores or suffer hair loss. Many things including diet, hormonal fluctuations, medication, hair care products and the environment affect the health of your scalp. Like Sue Sylvester's corrupted coif, many modern scalps   and the hair they wear   could benefit from some TLC. Here are a few tips to help you get your scalp back into superior shape.

How come ordinary people can pay a 37% tax rate on textbooks and then a 20% tax rate on all future income earned from that initial investment? Call it "long term knowledge gains". Oh, that right, because if ordinary people paid as little in taxes as the ultra rich and corporations the whole system would collapse. Like if the entire New Zealand stock exchange only paid $130M in taxes.

I think islamist is not just using islam in a political manner, at least not in practice. If that were enough, basically every government of every muslim country in the world today should be considered islamist when they are certainly not described that way in news media.

That does not mean i was not gonna try or that i will not be sad when it failed. However the fact that it failed after 4 years, that is what hurts the most. 
But generally, is this a spot where it worth it, even if my pot odds are right, when I feel like I better than the table? I think I have enough of an edge that I find better spots where I farther ahead, and that I making good money on steals/aggressive play post flop without showdown. Curious for thoughts.. 
And it now seems likely that the casino will be closed for some time as Mr Mulholland may have to seek a material contravention to secure planning permission for the casino at its current location. The area in question is zoned retail/industrial and as a casino type development does not fit these planning criteria, the development would need the support of six of the nine Castlebar town councillors to materially contravene the current Castlebar Town Development Plan..

Additionally, you have a chance to showcase your salesmanship and persuasive communication with a good response. 
Hahah that's a pretty funny and accurate analogy on his demeanor. I've never met him irl, but the reason I despise him is the way he treats people. In several of his videos he projects hate towards other players just for being fishy or unknowledgeable about poker. 
More generally, for poker rules questions, I suggest consulting Robert's Rules of Poker. A home game version of the rules is also available. 
I wouldn do it personally, but it not like something so gross that I have to turn it off.

GROWTH"Gambling is now bigger than baseball, more powerful than a platoon of Schwarzeneggers, Spielbergs, Madonnas and Oprahs. More Americans went to casinos than to major league ballparks in 1993. After 1978, gamblingaccelerated at an incredible pace and it is a big business, withstaggering dollar amounts: on a typical day in the mid 1990s,consumers spent $627,213 every minute of every day on all types ofcommercial "gambling" in the USA and all of these commercial "gaming"ventures combined made a profit of $56,970 per minute! If you wish,you can legally gamble (or be "entertained") in 48 of the 50 statesand only Hawai'i and Utah have no legal gambling activities. 
Then I (and the lab tech) signed a sticker that is placed on the cup and they sent it to some lab (out of state in my case) and the results were emailed back within 48 72hrs. 
Really just depends on what you consider depressing.
Nerfs. Not sure what route they take there. 
It did, however, paint one hell of a picture of the marriage of Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore ) as we learned how they met and, we're assuming, what happened just before they were torn apart.Despite the fact that drank the entire way, Jack made it to Rebecca's show in one piece, and continued to drink. 
Ah, I see what you mean. In my experience, I've known quite a few attractive Indian guys (so I never had that indianpeoplefacebook stereotype in my mind). I may be unique since the school I grew up in was very selective and we had a disproportionately large percentage of good Indian guys and the hottest girl in the grade (a blonde, interestingly) was crazy for Indian guys and cheated on her Indian boyfriend with another Indian guy so I guess I never had the thought that Indian guys were inherently ugly or something. 
Because it an effective means of controlling the population. 
They cut all her hair off. 
We feel a new framework is required that changes the way research is administered to rebalance the system away from an industry that has created most of it back to a focus on the patient and those with the primary responsibility of looking after them..

The Volunteer Center maintains an online database of service opportunities that is searchable by potential volunteers. 
Which side? I honestly not sure what you arguing now. He has no actual arguments beyond "common sense," he dismisses evidence specifically and science generally when it clearly rules out his pet theory, he has absolutely no evidence for any of his positions, and the majority of his writing descends into crude Victorian moralising..

One Piece is an epic, and it used to be my favourite, but I think after 900 chapters, while still very invested in the story, it loses a lot of its energy.

I see them analyzing the board, thinking about the hand, etc. 
Or at all in some cases. Of course if you have a very "rich" friend that has a lot of poker chips, and plays on high stake tables you can also get poker chips from him :). In any case what everyone should watch out for is Scam emails and messages in facebook where you are supose to be awarded or baned for any reason, and you are asked to click a link to verify your account, where you would need to login of course; when you login to that link you don't actually verify anything you just give out your password and account to some hackers. 
I don know about that. 
An electrode implanted in the brain of a rat had slipped from its intended place and had come to rest on the medial forebrain bundle, a group of nerve cells that leads from deep in the brain to the prefrontal cortex. 
Even the less ideal but still desolate planets would be far superior to say building a base on the Moon, since they can use the Stargate back and forth. Getting water to where we want to live outside of Earth is one our biggest challenges, but the Tau can just set up one planet to source water for all the others that need extra.
Prosecutors have to have fun, too. That could be mined for tax revenues that could help pay off some of the debt S is so worried about. 
I wish I could tell you that non housebroken patrons were a freak occurrence, but it actually became such a huge problem for us that the Mohegan Sun now has an environmental services team just to come in and take our soiled chairs away for deep cleaning.

I think the fight he just had was a piss poor showing of any untapped potential he may have in this specific organization.

EDIT: Oh FFs stop jumping down my throat. I was just addressing the bit about her talking to him about her kids. That's it. Honesty is powerful. Making ammends means turning himself in. Sorry I didn't write a book to make that clear. I never said she shouldn't turn him in, he should face up to his crimes. but I do think it does everyone more good if through honest conversation with his daughter he decides to do the right thing and inform on the traffickers and distributors by turning himself in. THAT is how he makes ammends for his actions. He is unlikely to get jail time. We're answering a question posed by his own kid. If we have compassion for HER, encouraging him to do the right thing would give her more peace than the swat team showing up.
He was also an outstanding fastball player for many years, and was known as one of the best players in and around the Toronto area. Further, he had been considered a star goalie, and at one time drew interest from Conn Smythe, then owner of the Maple Leafs.

In many states, you have to be 21 to enter a casino. However, in certain states this is not the case   and sometimes different rules apply to card rooms. If you're under 21, try to find a place in your area where you're allowed to play with others who take it just as seriously as you do..

First time tourists arrive for the main street stroll, where historical re enactors stage gunfights with quick storylines, check out where legendary Wild Bill Hickok held his dead man poker hand of black aces and eights, and maybe make the arduous trek to Mount Moriah Cemetery to view the graves of Wild Bill, his adoring Calamity Jane and sheriff Seth Bullock. 
6. MANDATORY AND AUTOMATIC whole life sentences for online racist twitters Their words, not mine.
This threads a fucking rollercoaster. Apparently this streamer has both "obviously heard this track before as otherwise this is impossible" and at the same time is also "displaying a very ordinary talent that any professional musician has". If you not allowed on that ride because of a pre exisitng medical condition, you can hop over onto the slightly less jarring "only popular on twitch because she hot and blonde" and "a breath of fresh air because she so conservatively dressed" ride..
