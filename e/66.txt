I haven researched it much, but I suspect it was meant to be something to be used for the all the anma joints (sex parlors disguised as massage parlors) or gunma joints (same but no sex) and be censored or blurred out, but the photographer collection got leaked.

If you are in a bad mood then you are likely to lose focus and play emotionally rather than rationally. If at any point in the game you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated you should get up and take a break for 10 minutes or so.

I think the high APM (still have to go check the video myself for it) hurts the significance of the event quite a bit.

Why, up until now, same sex couples  even when reproductive and married  have often been denied the right to be with their partners in the hospital.Listing the usual litany of heart breaking stories of partners denied access as their loved ones die, the Obama administration is now demanding that any hospital receiving Medicaid/Medicare funding MUST not discriminate against anyone on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.Again, if the situation were reversed and straight couples were denied visitation rights, most people would see that things need to change.

ANOTHER CASINO AMENDMENT: The attorney general today gave approval to the form of a constitutional amendment that would allow casino gambling   specifically four Nancy Todd's Poker Palace and Entertainment venues in Pulaski, Miller, Crittenden and Franklin counties. Don't know anything about Nancy just yet, but she's repped by Peter Kumpe of Williams and Anderson and her website provides some background.

Alternatively, two muscles that attach below the knee joint that are capable of producing the pain you describe are gracilis (also a hip adductor, but crosses the knee joint), and sartorius. The action of sartorius is to flex the knee, flex the hip, and internally rotate the hip. When cycling and strongly pulling up on the pedals (as in a seated, low cadence climb), sartorius is powerfully contracting and can lead to both a tendon friction injury across the medial joint line (inside of the knee) and also an inflammation of the bursa (fluid filled sac designed to reduce friction) at its insertion (attachment) below the knee. Inflammation of this bursa (pes anserine bursa) produces a particularly exquisite burning pain. If it is one injury, sartorius fits the bill. If a secondary injury followed then it requires more posts..

Is this no limit tournament style play, or a limit cash game? Strategy between the two can be wildly different. I am a reasonably competent (but by no means great) no limit player, but I am worthless in a limit game (I just don't have a good feel for it). As a general rule, though, don't bluff. If you feel that a hand isn't worth playing, don't play it. Fold. This may mean you fold an entire orbit's worth of hands, and then only see the flop when you're big blind again. That's okay. If the other players are any good at all, they'll notice this. When you do play a hand, they'll assume you've got a monster. This will allow you to occasionally steal blinds with a marginal starting hand (Kxo, for example). When you do make a hand, though, play aggressively. Bet, bet, and bet some more; you (usually) want to bet out marginal hands before they have a chance to see more cards (and get lucky). Especially if you've got that one brash guy at the table who will call anything. He may bully a lot of people out of hands, but when he loses, he'll lose big, and you'll benefit.

H1, H2 and H3 viruses are common in humans and so a lot of human have at least partial immunity against them, so that the effect of an outbreak might not be that bad. If for example H5N1 however evolves, or merges with a pig or human virus in some barn in the world (which is imho very possible, as there are billions of birds, pigs and humans), then human will have little to no immunility to the new virus until a vaccine is available. The virus can easily be transmitted and morbidity and maybe mortality as well might be very high around the world.

9s9c is a great bluff hand you double block the nuts, and Ivey would def play 9Ts like this. He also blocks spades. i dont remember if the Q and J were both spades, but i think only one was. So Ivey can possibly have a hand like As9s, Ts9s, Js9s, 9s7s but that might be too loose.
The next poem, The Lost Art of Kissing a Government, delves further into the corpus both literally, and figuratively, as Taito refers to mouths (x 3), lips, teeth, tonsils, forked tongues, eyes, screams.

With the help of drink, poker, and a beguiling gypsy, they encounter the void within each other lives.Drink, cards, prophecy, comedy, and tragedy pervade this intriguing piece of theatre which examines identity and the way in which the seeds sown in the past have a habit of sprouting unexpectedly, whether we like it or not.The older of the play two male characters is Dave Duffy, instantly recognisable as Fair City stalwart Leo Dowling. 
The really strange thing though is that when they told me I pushed for 3 hours, I didn remember that at all. For me I thought it was the worst 15 minutes of my life.

The worst is doing a withdrawal and their site is empty of chp and they have to reload. People win chp they don even have to pay out. So peoples withdrawals are declined until they reload their cashier with chp. If you leave chp on that site you don own it they do. And thats not decentralized poker. Whatever is your personal wallet they should not be able to touch and what is in the players wallets should belong to you. But thats not the case. Its just like any other poker site. Your chp are owned by the site and when they run out you can with draw off the site even though it says you have a ton of coins in your wallet. Its a lie you don own those chp and your wallet chp is just a number there is no chp in it. They have the chp in seperate wallet and they run out even though your wallet says you have your chp. That might be the reason for mass sell off. I sold all my chp after I saw another player and myself get our withdraws declined because they didn have any chp left in their cashier. You can have these kind of problems. And sometimes the mtts dont pop up even though you entered. Also had a mtt recently freeze. Pretty much poorly ran company.

So, Lymond asks Christian about JC. Christian asks Dandy. Dandy lies to obtain the prisoner. This all seems like it (in a roundabout, unknowing way) to help Lymond.

Always the big performance, Lymond, I hope it not a Spoiler to say our guy needs a therapist, not just because the French translates (I think) to "I am a bird". The way he talks, he lucky sir George understands it a blackmail situation and not just the circus come to town.

Training and developing more business/management talent adept at building scale ups is paramount to catalyzing Canada economic potential.

The two forms of vitamin D used in supplements are D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). D3 is the preferred form, as it is chemically similar to the form of vitamin D produced by the body and is more effective than D2 at raising the blood concentration of vitamin D.[27] Since vitamin D is fat soluble, it should be taken with a snack or meal containing fat. In general, 100 IU of vitamin D daily can raise blood concentrations 1 ng/mL after 2 to 3 months (TABLE 2).[28] Once the desired blood concentration is achieved, most people can maintain it with 800 to 1,000 IU of vitamin D daily.[28] Even though dosages up to 10,000 IU daily do not cause toxicity, it generally is not recommended to take more than 2,000 IU daily in supplement form without the advice of a health care provider.[29] Individuals at high risk for deficiency should have a vitamin D blood test first; a dosage of up to 3,000 to 4,000 IU may be required to restore blood concentrations.[29]

Full disclosure, I help run these cruises, but could answer a few of your questions from WPT perspective. The price on WPT Cruise includes port fees, taxes gratuities. I believe after that is sorted, its probably only slightly higher the price you were quoted from RCI, although RCI does run some great specials and you might even get it for cheaper directly if you just want to go on a cruise. We get our cabin block early and price might be a bit higher. The WPT rents the conference area w/food, brings the tables, chips, cards, dealers, swag, talent, instructors, etc, so there is some extra cost.

As for how long it takes to see results. it depends on what you seeing them for, how often you seeing them, and whether they are a good fit. It may take a few tries to find a good working partnership   don be put off therapy altogether if the first attempt doesn feel like a good fit. There are a LOT of therapists out there and they all use different approaches and have their own different personalities. I would say that I usually expect to see some change by the third session, but it takes a while to see BIG changes for most people, I think. You should also be taking steps to figure out how to still get things done within a framework that suits you, otherwise it becomes your partner responsibility to keep you "on task" and that is a one way ticket to resentmentville. That said, it may also be that things you aren great at managing are totally not a thing for your partner   leverage that. Learn to be okay with accepting help and splitting things based on each other strengths, if needed. It isn a weakness, but I know many people take it that way.

I moved to Germany 3 years ago with my husband and I did the whole immersion classes. I would suggest you find a tutor instead of going to group classes. I not saying they are bad but I believe you learn faster by talking often and by having someone correct you right away. The classes I attended (and I did over 5 months of 20h/week of German classes!) had over 20 people in each group. There are so many people that you can speak enough with the teacher (answering questions and so on) or you are grouped with another student and you speak together (make mistakes and are not corrected). I don want to discourage you but the struggle is real! After 3 years my German is still not super good. People understand me but I don always understand people. And I still practice at least 30 minutes per day (vocab, watching German shows, etc). Don be too hard on yourself if it difficult. Feel free to PM me. 7 points  submitted 1 month ago

In poker you should drop out six out of seven hands (in stud, after the first cards are dealt; in draw, after looking at your initial hand). However, you should also win six out of seven hands in which you stay. So the odds are in your favor. Same holds true in selling. Drop out of the deal if you can't reach the decision makers. Not all deals are for you.

Yeah, I think the "ephemeral" quality of Sazae san where every episode is one that you watch and then is lost forever is (though not necessarily part of it initial success) a bit part of why Sazae san continues to hold such prominence in the rankings. I never seen any sort of academic study on such a thing, but I think people respond positively to the concept of nostalgia that can be easily "reclaimed" so to speak, versus all the nostalgia where you just buy the remastered DVD edition of the first couple seasons and never watch them.

"Texas Hold 'Em is so popular because it manages to accurately hit the mark between 'enough information to devise a consistently winning strategy' and 'not enough information to do much more than guess.' The charm in such games is that there is no perfect strategy, in the sense that there is no algorithm guaranteed to win in the long run against any other algorithm. The best poker players are able to use different algorithms against different opponents as the situation warrants."

Not sure how popular it was because a smaller proportion of people used personal computers, but Usenet was the main game in town if you wanted to stay in touch with a global social circle. It was the weirdest thing from today perspective: completely unregulated and anarchic but still the most effective way to access a global pool of people who shared your interests. There was even this phenomenon you could find unbelievable today where Usenet was a way to distribute movies, which special software would break up into smaller files you spend ages downloading one at a time before your software reassembled them into one file. There were also relatively crude dial up based file sharing services that we find hillarious today.

I remember specifically getting caught drinking in the garage when I was 16. My dad was PISSED and I had to write a 20 page essay about what the consequences of teenage drinking were to my 16 year old brain, how much legal trouble I could have gotten into, and how much legal trouble my parents could have gotten into for allowing teenage drinking.
Watching porn might make you bisexual. At least that seems to be the takeaway from a study released by the online porn portal xHamster. Dubbed the xHamster on Digital Sexuality and released Tuesday, the survey of 11,000 users finds that the more porn you watch, the likelier you are to go both ways.
The conceit of the game central factional squabble   Stormcloaks vs an Empire   is evocative of the same ideological tensions around through which so many of us live today : Nationalism/Globalism, Racism/Multiculturalism etc etc. Even in a very specifically American context, the colors of the game factions are Red and Blue..

It was Madhavendra Puri who began the bhakti of Radha Krsna. And it was finally Mahaprabhu who gave the topmost understanding of rasa and the consequent supremacy of Krsna tattva from that point of view.With all due respect, teachings like this are much more condescending than anything on that site.In fact this site has been condemned heavily by multiple Dvaita leaders for its offensive and often times character attacks on Srila Prabhupada.I wasn't aware Dvaita leaders had condemned it. But I don't find it surprising that people attack Prabhupada's character since he himself was very disrespectful towards many teachers and even Gods.

I needed a cash infusion into my REI business so I began looking for a Fix n Flip opportunity. I found a wonderful 4/2 foreclosure with a private pool in Orlando that needed quite a bit of TLC. When I first walked in it there were a few other people in there shaking their heads saying it needed too much work. I kept my Poker face though because I was seeing mostly cosmetic repairs needed and some updating. It was listed in MLS as a 3 bedroom but is actually a 4 bedroom. Score! It's in a quiet neighborhood that has mature landscaping and even has sidewalks. (You don't realize how nice it is to have sidewalks until you have them in one neighborhood and don't have them in the next) The work started about 2.5 weeks ago and we're still pretty close to where we should be in my 30 day rehab schedule.

From Cappadocia we drove towards the Mediterranean coast. About an hour into the drive, we got pulled over for speeding. This in a country where there are no speed limits posted! And where you share the road with sheep and goats. Of course, theygave us a ticket which we paid on the spot (about $30) and then started chatting with us. By the time we left them, we were wishing each other pleasant days and thanking each other. Like most of the Turkish people we met, they were so nice and friendly and seemed happy to meet American tourists (granted, Wendi and I were a sight, flying by, driving an ancient Turkish taxi with our hair blowing in the wind and Madonna on the discman!). As we pulled away, I thought, "They just gave us a ticket and now we are pals???". But we drove on (a little slower, but not much) and we were looking forward to the sun and beach of the Mediterranean.

Secondly, Star Trek is a futuristic utopia in which humankind evolved beyond crony capitalism and have embraced a post scarcity system of sustenance and exchange. Healthcare is universal.

Okay, these two images1 the head and foot of this post have almost nothing to do with Mars and Francis Galton, except that they were advertisements in the issue of Nature 12, 1896) in which his notice on the possibility of extraterrestrial communication is discussed. That, and that the ads are very engaging, as is the report on Galton. Actually this is a report on a Galton paper that appeared two weeks earlier in the Fortnightly Review ("Intelligible signals between neighbouring stars", volume 60, pp 657 64, November 1, 1896), and shared to a more scientifically centered reading population than the other journal. Given the contemporary mileu of possible/expectant life on Mars, Galton thought about ways in which we could send some sort of communication, and what the logic of that "language" might be. He presents the idea of symbols, picture writing, with a combined arithmetic etymology to display an additive language that would show Martian observers a level of intelligence on Earth.

These are the rather perverse questions that Michel Foucault sets out to examine in his History of Sexuality. Foucault suggests that such "liberation" politics do not transcend oppression, but are in fact within systems of oppression.

My (ex)girlfriend and I where in Wildwood a few weeks ago for the fourth of July weekend, we were camping with some friends in at Driftwood just a short drive away and we wanted to see fireworks. I had never been there before. We got to the boardwalk at just about 10pm, the beach was "closed" but really there was no one or anything stopping us so onto the beach we went. It was amazing. The sky was crystal clear so you could see all the stars and the walk to the water felt so epic, how often are you on a giant beach essentially by yourself? It was surreal. And the moon. dude, it was a full blood moon hanging over the ocean and it just made it seem like we were on another planet, it was beautiful.
