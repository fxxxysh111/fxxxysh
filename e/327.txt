He would find that variable stars in Andromeda were an order of magnitude further away than the greatest dist ant of the furthest star in the Milky Way, and so determined that Andromedia was a galaxy unto itself, and not within our own. 
All you young starters, hang in there. One day you will get run support! And Brian, get off you ass and get us some players that will get them and us that run support for Gods sake! We are sick and tired of so so teams. 
Thelred did take action in response to the Viking invaders, yet what he did do was ineffective. 
It simply a rather transparent attempt to justify theistic faith which is, by definition, believing in things despite the lack of good evidence to do so, by claiming that atheists have "blind faith" in science too. However, it simply not a valid analogy. 
Why is poker called poker?
(team 1 went 3 0 and team 2 went 3 1). Now that we are going to the playoffs, they will still be ranked no1 and no2, even though they both faced each other in the beginning, because their round win rate was so dominant. In this particular example team 2 actually ranks above team 1 (75% rounds won VS 77%) but that only because they are so dominant VS the rest that playing one extra game push their average higher. 
This game is called fun poker and rightfully so because it is thoroughly enjoyable! Fun poker is much a celebration of skill as luck. 
Finally on the very last turn I was able to play enough cards for each spirit with exactly enough energy to generate enough fear to clear the last two fear cards, giving me the win. 
(Thank you, six7s!)
The Fat Cat bankers have their hands in the People pockets. Again they laugh maniacally. What or who will save the People from such a crime? Superman? Perhaps little Shirley Temple with her curls and big eyes tugging on the fat cat banker sleeve with a "Pweeze Mr.

It's your body. Just like if someone has their ears fixed or a nose job. They don't need to volunteer that information.cssnide5   279 points  submitted 11 hours agoHe's Hispanic and therefor cannot be racist because his group does not hold institutional power in our society. Is OP white? If so she is actually the racist one because she didn't understand the cultural musical differences because of her white privilege. 
Now to be clear, nothing is ever all down hill around here, you are always climbing in order to descend, so you always have to be turning the pedals. 
Button open is fine with these stack sizes and a fish in blinds. Flop play is ok with a nice disguised gutshot and great implied odds here, if the fish is raising for value here, he is never going to fold when you hit.
Tanjung Pinang is not a vy ideal place to go unless you want to hv a quiet stay for 3days 2nite.

It could be different study design, different durations, different measurement techniques, poor data reporting, erroneous conclusions. They might have used the wrong statistical calculation. 
The new Market District food court has great food, and out of all the Detroit casinos, this one has the nicest staff. 
They are more accurate that one would think, easy to fix in the field, easier to suppress with items simply found around us, they are often not as loud as a rifle, and certainly quieter than a shotgun, they do not have a short range, they are honestly harder to fumble or drop, less recoil means faster refire while retaining a general ammount of accuracy, and 9mm (the most common pistol round) can penetrate most surfaces at close range. This is all assuming that we talking about a glock or M9. 
If you want a great conversation starter, Hollander suggested putting thePuppy Bowlon TV before the big game. The show features adorable rescue pups frolicking on a small gridiron.
I wish I knew who you are. Curiosity is killing me. But anyway, you could always be like a Batman or something. Just configure a whole secret identity and do that. We could trade places for awhile if you want. I have five cats, unemployed, and I binge eat. You could totally hide out here and no one would be the wiser. You get a cool set of flip flops and everyone calls you "the cat lady". Other than that, you could always get into video games or something, create an online identity and just make friends through there. Anywho, sorry you hate being famous. I would hate all of that too, but, I bet you look a lot better half naked on your couch than I do in my living room watching every series of everything on Netflix. So you win. Have you considered blogging?
We politely declined all forms of transportation, lowered our heads against the wind and blowing sand, and toured the site. The buildings carved into the walls are beyond incredible. Petra was built by ancient Arab tribes, the Nabataeans, who came from the Arabian Peninsula 2,200 years ago. 
This is why Obi Wan said that he failed Anakin; Obi Wan never managed to impart his wisdom of the true high ground to his apprentice.. 
Sleep sounds like a given, right? Not so much. While your friends and family are reminding you to "stock up on sleep" before the midnight feedings start (as if that's even possible), a full night's shut eye becomes more and more elusive thanks to your changing body shape, late night leg cramps, endless trips to the bathroom, and your husband's snoring (which never used to keep you up!).

Thin women have cellulite. Dimpling is common on the thighs of cellulite sufferers, but it can also occur on the buttocks, lower abdomen, hips and arms.

As outspoken as he is tall, Ruhanen joins the Ad Lib podcast today to discuss all of that and more   not only the current state of TBWA, but of agencies in general. He's bullish on his shop, which comes with the territory, but has some words of caution for everyone.
Better reach out to non bernie voters than youtube. Youtube will most likely only recommend Bernie streams after you already watched socialist ish political videos. 
Having a job even a nearly full time job was what helped me stay most focused at school (BS   EE/CE). It helps avoid procrastination excuses, helps with managing time, and if you work it well enough you actually have some semblance of independence at the end of the day. If working is overwhelming but you still need money I would tell anyone to focus their damned hardest to get a job with the school they attend. 
Given its ambitions, it unsurprising that Crazy Rich Asians has been held to high standards. It was criticized before a single scene was shot for the casting of British Malaysian actor Henry Golding as Nick and Japanese British Argentine actor Sonoya Mizuno as Araminta Lee. But the litigation of whether mixed race actors are enough has overshadowed the number of cast and crew members who are Straits Chinese, such as Lim, Yeoh, associate producer Janice Chua, actor Tan Kheng Hua and Ronny Chieng, who was born in Malaysia, grew up in Singapore and cinched the multi national life of his character Edison Cheng by attending law school in Australia. strived very hard to match the perfect accent to every actor, and I think we did a pretty amazing job, but sometimes we had to make concessions, Kwan says. this actor was amazing, but he not going to sound like he went to Hong Kong top boarding school his whole life.

There have been TREMENDOUS changes due to community feedback. However traditional things that we have historically received with past content drops (vendor resets, strikes, and crucible maps/modes) being absent with the annual pass while not necessarily a slap in the face can still feel like it to long term players who have become accustomed to these in the past. One thing that I noticed about ANY community is that they don like things being taken away from them after a pattern has been established. 356 points  submitted 5 days ago
Handling is a very important consideration when it comes to casino poker chips weight.

I watched the whole thing and it was amazing. I think that most people that claim to be "woke" or knowledgeable arent out here watching almost 5 hour long videos.

I have bad experience with TGV, but in France.

What they encountered in Iraq (and for some reason they had all served in Iraq) was racism against the Iraqi people, religious bigotry, and even racism and religious bigotry within the military itself. They also encountered the truth that America had been "misled" (lied to) about the reasons for being in Iraq. And finally, they encountered the awful truth that they could be sent back indefinitely, that making it through one or even two tours of duty did not guarantee them freedom.

Incredibly, she says she has more to say about the SNC Lavalin scandal rocking the Justin Trudeau government.statement to the committee was not a complete account, but only a detailed summary, the former attorney general said Wednesday, the same day two key Ottawa power players told their side of the SNC Lavalin saga.Gerald Butts, Trudeau former principal secretary, and Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, both denied pressuring Wilson Raybould to let the Liberal connected, Quebec based company off the hook on criminal corruption charges.Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, prepares to appear before the standing committee on justice and human rights regarding the SNC Lavalin affair on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on March 6.But the testimony of the two powerful insiders raised more questions than they answered. And by the end of the day testimony, it was obvious Wilson Raybould needed to return to the witness stand.The Vancouver Granville MP said she would happily comply.would, of course, make myself available to answer any further questions and to provide further clarity, Wilson Raybould said.High profile MPs Jody Wilson Raybould and Jane Philpott have both left the Liberal caucus amid the SNC Lavalin affair.

I would not isolate this hand even if the guy is pretty loose. First is limping from utg so the guy is likely to like his hand and not folding. But that's not a real problem as we are ip. The main problem is that it is a fairly low buys for a live tournament and from my experience it is full a calling happy player. Especially in the early stage of the tournament . You basically have no fold equity. So I would just limp along, expecting to be called by btn, sb bb very very often. And 150bb deep T9s is not a very good hands especially multi ways as your suit will likely to be dominated by vilains ( I'm not talking about standard ranges here, I talk with my experience of live mtt.

Hand 1: For me this depends on my roll. I play extremely over rolled (I have 4k in money I could contribute to online poker if I so choose) and only play $1 $20 tournaments, heavily weighted towards $5 $10. If your roll is similar this is an awesome spot to just rip it in and pray for a double/triple up. At higher stakes players are definitely capable of the cold 4b with weaker holdings than AA and KK unlike in lower stakes. If BB is competent I would imagine he recognizes button is a fish with a short stack and is trying to isolate. I like putting the pressure on here and being prepared for the rebuy or being extremely comfortable with a big stack ready for a deep run. Tons of dead money up for grabs and with your stack size feels like a great shove.

Three of a kind is when you don't have any pair to make it a full house, while two pair is having two sets of pair in a hand, such as holding jack of diamonds and clubs, and another pair of two of hearts and two of diamonds. One pair is when you only have one set of a pair. And lastly, the lowest hand is when you only have high cards such as the ace, the king, the queen. This hand does not form any of the better hands thus its lowly level. As in any variant of poker, the thing to remember in free poker is that the degree of difficulty in forming the hands determine the value it has in the chain.

Oh, so a straight man can marry God/Jesus and it no homo, but if a gay man devotes himself to a masculinized church, it homo? confusing, to say the least, but not nearly as dangerous and just plain mean spirited as blaming pedophilia on homosexuality.

For the NL variants, I would expect one to beat the lower stakes by modeling the market and the higher stakes by modeling individual players. As there are sites logging each hand played on the major sites, it would be interesting to see whether it would be possible to beat players by making their simulacra from that data and train bots by pitting them against those simulacra.2) It has intriguing property that like Go and Chess, it is easy to dispense with the real time constraint and in lieu of modeling human players, create synthetic experience.

I agree with you 100%. I think the usefulness of student evaluations would increase substantially if students took the time to actually do this.

That makes the evaluations so much better than. "The textbook was completely pointless." Now I get comments like "I don understand why other students complained about the textbook, I actually did the assigned reading and it was really helpful for reinforcing information from class".

Personally, I love the fact that there an upper deck on the A380, and where possible, I always try to book myself an economy class seat in the solitary upper deck cabin (not all airlines have an economy cabin on the upper deck). This is the big game changer for me being able to sit higher off the ground and know there another cabin beneath you is a great feeling! The B787 Dreamliner has its benefits too, though, with the entire aircraft designed to give you a smoother ride and to reduce the effects of jetlag upon disembarkation.

I worked in administration for one in the 90s and had my children in them for daycare and various preschool programs for a few years. Back then, they were very well run. Accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, which had much higher standards than state regulations. Higher child/caregiver ratios. Frequent training, tuition reimbursement for employees, much higher pay than in the civilian world so that there was little employee turnover, a ton of oversight. All of this was done in response to how crappy childcare was in the 80s and how many joint military couples, working spouses, and single parents were in the military. One of my jobs was to go to all the rooms hourly and go over the logs and verbally confirm feedings, bathroom breaks, diapers changes. I also checked bottles in the refrigerators, and did spot checks to make sure that the correct bottles were being fed to the right babies, and also checking to see if the amount of bottles in the cubbies matched the documented feedings. It was very serious business. I had to fire someone for feeding the wrong bottle to a kid, and it was immediate, she was gone. We had ample staffing so that if there were any issues, we could replace a caregiver in minutes. All of these things and more were in every standard operating procedure for every CDC around the world. I wonder what the fuck happened that so many are now being investigated???

This can come in the form of a driving license, a pilot's license, a hair dresser's license, a funeral director's license, an embalmer's license, a veterinary license, a masseur's license, a sports therapist's license, a real estate license, a mechanic's license, a clergy's license, an electrician's license, a gas safety inspector's license, to name a few.

Not only did it not work since most children are still abused by people they know and this issue wasn ever really addressed. But the net so big that too many people are being named sexual predators and too few actual sex criminals are being monitored.

So if you 61, don send photos to your 62 year old lover. And if you 17, do not snap the photo of yourself nude for your 16 year old lover.

In October 2016, the SPLC published a list of "anti Muslim extremists", including British activist Maajid Nawaz and ex Muslim activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The SPLC said that Nawaz appeared to be "more interested in self promotion and money than in any particular ideological dispute," identified what it said were gaps and inconsistencies in his backstory, and rebuked his claim that British universities had been infiltrated by radical Islamists.[103] Nawaz, who identifies as a "liberal, reform Muslim", denounced the listing as a "smear", saying that the SPLC listing had made him a target of jihadists. Mark Potok of the SPLC responded "Our point is not to make these people targets for violence.

In purely economic terms, there are reasons to join the military, get married and send our children to parochial schools that are much less expensive because they are religious. In a country where income distribution is by far the most unequal in the industrialized world, where access to higher education involves huge amounts of debt for the majority of Americans, and where jobs that pay a livable wage are few and far between without a university degree, the military is one of the few promised paths to future financial well being.

Moderation in this group is always biased FOR the OP (the person who made the post   not the commenters). For example, if an OP does not appreciate comments of a religious nature, the moderators will defend the OP boundaries.

We often see commenters confused and feel that any comment should be allowed, because this is a support group. But, we are biased FOR the OP needs and boundaries. When you write your own post asking for support, we will also be biased for you.

We have entirely shared accounts with the exception of our individual retirement accounts and a single credit card each (though all are aggregated into Mint which we can both see). It's what works for us, and I totally understand why separate accounts might work better for others, but I don't understand secret accounts except in cases of abuse.

There is more that they can do to ensure that their retirement income is not eroded by inflation. Top of the list pay off the $40,000 home equity loans. Half of that is at a floating rate of 4.2 per cent and half at 3.29 per cent. Interest rates are rising, so using some cash from non registered investments makes sense. They can also cut expenses $1,900 a month for food and dining out for two people is high; some trimming could save $500 per month. They are shelling out $1,000 per month to keep one car running. Trade it in, Egan suggests. They have a sailboat on which they spend $500 per month. If pressed, that could go. And there is $1,612 of cash savings as a cushion. It would grow if some expenses were cut.

Tl;dr, I thought it was weird that everyone is complaining about frozen food still being frozen after being in a microwave for a short period of time.

It turns out you guys have higher wattage microwaves, and that direct frozen >microwave meals are a normal thing over there, and everyone complaining is for some reason not following instructions.

Right now, the tech can't be hacked because it is all wired: the brain chip is connected by cable to a computer, the computer is offline (not on an Ethernet or WiFi network), and the decoded instructions for movement are transferred by USB to a muscle stimulator that is in direct contact with Ian's arm. We are working towards remote control of devices (car) for mobility, and that will require a secure, non hackable network. If brain activity were hacked, what the hacker would see is a large stream of numbers, ranging from  1000 to 1000 microvolts (though numbers can be larger with environmental noise). The real concern would be if the connection to Ian's arm were networked, and thus, hackable   we don't want a hacker taking control of Ian's hands! This is why we are currently using a wired system.

Never show your hand if you win refers to not showing your hand if you bet, and everyone else folds. In that case, you win no matter what the community cards (the five cards in the middle of the table) are. If you win this way in an earlier betting round, they won't even finish dealing the community cards out.

This adaptation was made before the full enforcement of the Hays Code (1934 68), which means the film has a surprising degree of nudity and sexual references.

Our store phone was broken for a few months or so(which has been nice not taking calls) but it gets a lot of questions why we dont pick up the phone when they call.

Remember, tournaments are partly about staying alive, consider what is obvious but often ignored: wagering all your chips on a gamble will at best double your chips if you're lucky but at worst get you busted out of the tournament.

Challenges: Most interactions regarding challenges are controlled through the app on your phone. But if someone on my Fitbit friends list invites me to a challenge, I can join the challenge via the notification on my versa (make sure you set your versa to receive notifications from the Fitbit app).

Missing link bonding capability. Hopefully in the future instead of using a model where at any given time a customer is using a single upstream pathway which when a problem occurs requires a 5 minute outage to switch to another pathway, some form of link bonding is used so that multiple pathways are used from a single customer to upstream houses at all times and as latency increases or packet loss increases, traditional packet by packet routing decisions are made to route around the poor link.

Trump judges everyone by his own greed and vanity.

Transportation cost is low assuming you only use public ones. Monthly it would be around 300 RMB if you work and live in the urban part of Shanghai, and since students have more leisure time to hang around, 500 would be a reasonable maximum per month.

Why and how those problems occur, and what to do about it, are still very much matters of debate. Is severe problem gambling a disease or an illness? Is it an addiction in the clinical sense? Are people born with a predisposition to problem gambling? Could there even be a problem gambling gene? There's no agreement on the answers, and yet they're crucial in shaping our responses to problem gambling: clinically, economically, governmentally, and individually.

In Tripoli, Lebanon, a depressingly complacent 40 year old baker still lives with his mother. He is, with no exaggeration, the epitome of a "mama's boy." His mom cooks for him, cleans for him she even keeps his nights busy by acting as his poker buddy or by making him help her dye her hair.

As an attorney I have to take substance abuse prevention/awareness classes every 2 years to continue practicing in my jurisdiction. It really doesn't seem to be helping though. We had something called barristers' ball at my school (basically law prom) and it was the craziest display of drunkenness and poor decision making I have ever seen.
