I don think I gave up professional fulfillment, really. I still worked in higher education, just not in the sub field within higher education that I wanted to due to nothing in that area being available at that time. I still was able to gain experience that actually made me more competitive for the position that I have now. And, not living in my dream place was not something that was a deal breaker for me, obviously. I said that to illustrate how important the relationship was to me. I wasn unhappy, necessarily, living in my home state. I just would have preferred somewhere else. I made a small sacrifice for someone who was worth it in my opinion. And living in that state was extremely important to her. You have to compromise every now and then on those things. I guess that part of the reason that I deemed the relationship perfect. On anything we may have differed, we always compromised in healthy ways.
I don regret watching it, time you spent being entertained is hardly time wasted. 
While Trump tries to buy time, the exchange of threats from Washington and Riyadh is more than bluster, said Dr. Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

"The question is, is there a way for everyone to win here while getting justice for the alleged murder?"

All true but it wouldn last very long lol. You would be hopping from casino to casino, country to country making ridiculous amounts of money with sick plays but people would figure you out and word would spread very quickly that you are some kind of freak that can predict outcomes and basically no one will play you. Would be the same for Blackjack if you could predict the card before hitting, every casino in the world would ban you real quick whether they believe you cheating or not. Even if you bust or lose once in awhile to make it seem less obvious, the fact that you consistently make money almost every time gambling would be the red flag. 1 point  submitted 1 year ago

2. Focus on your cards and not on your opponents   an example of this common mistake is when a player goes all the way to the river with a pair of aces no matter what. If you have a pair of aces, the flop is Ten of diamond, 8 of diamond and 7 of heart, the turn is 6 of diamond and suddenly a passive player starts betting or raising, most of the chances that your pair is beaten and you should fold. There are so many possible hands that beat you, and you have practically no 'outs' to get.

Anyone who thinks they know about Pacific Films will be amazed to discover the enormity of the company's output, described so well by John Reid after an immense amount of research. And anyone who thought that Pacific Films faced only occasional opposition will be shocked to discover for how long it faced so many stubborn rejections   not only from both of New Zealand's two theatrical exhibition companies at various times, but also from the monopolistic government owned National Film Unit and later from the equally monopolistic and inward looking state television system (which refused to show anything made by Pacific Films or to commission any productions, except during a brief period when Tahu Shankland was head of production.)

Written a few times in this blog about what I think isfound/unintentional antiquarian Dadaist art, as in Floating Eyes and Ears, 1650, (and also (here, here and here) and would like to continue that thread with this found bit of 1930 Costumery.]The Beaux Arts Ball, Halloween 1931, featured a dozen or so of some of the principal architects in NYC dressed as their most esteemed structures. The end result in this uncomfortable assembly is delightfully absurd the outfits could have easily been found on stage in Berlin in 1923 than as this salute to privilege. (For example see my post from last week on Oskar Schlemmer.)For the record, we see:A. Stewart Walker, dressed (and almost completely engulfed) as his Fuller Building at 57th Street (and not the Fuller building which is today known as as the Flat Iron Building);Leonard Schultze as the Waldorf Astoria;Ely Jacques as the Squibb Building (so delightfully nestled in there with the Plaza and Savoy Plaza);William Van Alen as the Chrysler Building (which, three years now after its groundbreaking, was still the tallest building in the world, though it would be eclipsed within months by the completed Empire State Building. The New York Times Building is the exact height of the Chrysler Building, though this bleak structure in no other way can compare to Alen masterpiece.)

Perhaps we could even take a lesson from Christian Orthodoxy for our postmodern, secular cultures and apply iconography to contemporary media.

John Sarno coined the term TMS and wrote the controversial book "Healing Back Pain" some many years ago. He suggests an emotional answer to people back pain, which I wholeheartedly agree with. Many people have been helped by his book whereas other methods have failed. However, he was very unfriendly in his book to PT DC LMT LAc and the like. He thought that any sort of hand on therapy or exercise program was total hogwash and barking up the wrong tree. I don really agree with him.

In Sweden, hundreds of bank branches no longer accept or dispense cash, and thousands of ATM machines have been permanently removed.

But that turns into free to vote for who they are told to vote for behind closed doors. If you have a system than can be manipulated it will be.

Most likely a more business friendly candidate like Beto or Biden will be chosen. And then we will have 4 more years of no meaningful reforms.

After a hard day fighting stressed out executives, soulless co workers and brain dead bosses, nothing feels better than a nice, soothing massage. Massage is a millennia old technique, similar to acupressure, of using pressure and motion to relax muscles. Like acupressure and acupuncture, massage as a science probably has its origins in China. However, it is now practiced in all parts of the world, and is recognized as a legitimate medical art by all.

Note: Homeopaths warn that using the wrong remedy may bring on a mild case of the symptoms that the remedy treats.

Never done this in the snow but I have made corner "tieouts" by double layering duct tape on the corners of my polycryo and using some shock cord to tie out to the corners of my duomid. I only do the two "back wall" corners and then use two wire stakes to do the other two corners so that I don overhang my groundsheet too much into my vesitbule. This has worked pretty well. If the corners start to wear out, I just throw another piece of tape over them and punch a new whole. Normally they don become unusable before I replace my poly though.

Bluffing is an essential part and aspect of playing poker and in our opinion, it is the best and most enjoyable feature of the game. Poker is exciting because you not only have to guess what your opponents have in their hands, but you also have to disguise the cards you have.

Whole thing is meant to be a joke, indicating emphasis on simple concepts with a gesticulation that became somewhat popular from "unintelligent" reality TV characters who did it for everything.

That more to do with the people and not the joke. Besides, the people most likely to say inflammatory political statements with no apparent consideration for opposing views are going to say that regardless of the clap emoji.

He does call Credence "my boy" in the final scene when he presents him with a wand)

I may be completely off here but judging by the fact that for some people resolve the issue by either taking the side of their case off, maxing their fan speed on their gpu, lowering fps_max, lowering the texture streaming setting, increasing power performance to "prefer max performance" in nvidia control panel, disabling their 2nd monitor, closing discord or in my case minimizing discord and usually it hardware accelerated by the gpu. It seems very likely that the crash is caused by mismanagement/lack of GPU resources or a sudden dip in GPU performance. Considering all of those options either improve cooling performance and thus decreases the chance a GPU will underclock itself from getting to hot, provides maximum power for the GPU to utilize or just using less GPU resources.

Could England Have Been Stronger?There is evidence to suggest that England could have been a much stronger power and created a much stronger resistance than it in fact did. In 1008, thelred started work on building a navy whose ships were described as being 'more of them than had ever been in England in the days of any king'.

One last thing I'd say though   I think it would be worthwhile for you to be proficient in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) too, particularly some of the more advanced CSS2.1 and CSS3 stuff that will be available cross browser when IE8 is released (because it's already supported in FF, Opera, and Safari), and become familiar with javascript libraries like YUI. I often see people writing crazy server side code for things that could much more easily be accomplished in CSS and / or a bit of javascript. Plus those are also the technologies you'd use to make your app look slick and sexy.

I had a set of Aces on an Ace 2 4 flop in a 4 bet pot, and jammed into.53o. No bluffs got through (and I really mean none). I had AcTc on a 6c7c2s board, called a jam from a guy bluffing with Qs8h, and the turn came 9h, river 10h.

The rules of hold 'em are simple enough. Players get two cards down (in the hole). There is a round of betting. Five more cards will come, face up, and players share those cards. First the dealer turns up three cards (the flop), then one card (the turn) and then a final card (the river). There is betting between each deal. In tournament hold 'em, every player begins with the same number of chips and plays until they are gone or he gets them all. Certain odds have been committed to memory since the game was invented in Robstown, Texas, nearly 100 years ago. You are 4 to 1 to win with any pair in the hole against a lower pair; you have just a 1 in 15 chance of hitting a flush when dealt two cards of the same suit.

It was during that process that I found out there are federal agents in each hospital that oversee what the doctors prescribe. The doctors where afraid of these federal agents deciding they prescribe too many pain killers and then ruining their medical practice because they allowed a cancer patient who was going to be dead in a few weeks to die a comfortable death..

The fervor and ideological fury with which many people attempt to dismiss the modernization benefits is a prime example of revisionism people feel justified ignoring facts about one area of history because of ongoing anger over the atrocities committed by the imperial regime.

Complaint: I filled the holes with rocks, hired trappers, installed sixty feet of hardware cloth around the base of the wall, and still the skunks will not stop trying to get under my porch. I hear and smell them at night, wake up every morning to find dirt moved from different spots, and usually find one hanging out on the far side trying to rip through whatever it can reach. It doesn even run when it sees me. It stands there waiting until I bang a stick against the wall to scare it away. Why is my house so alluring to these things? I don even know if killing them would make a difference. There an endless supply, and they eventually going to get in again because there only one of me and I have to sleep sometime. I feel better now, thanks for listening.

But in my defense I was only 24, how was I supposed to know better?
