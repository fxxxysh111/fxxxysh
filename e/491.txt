The tomatoes can then be chopped and used in sauces and other cooked dishes, the peaches in baked goods and smoothies. Some people skip the coring and the bags, and just freeze the fruit loose with skins intact.

I was really concerned about seeing someone without a photo, but my curiosity got the best of me. Not to worry guys. Rev. Roxanne is no skinny mini, but she is attractive and well kept. She has soft skin, and skills like you wouldn't believe. I found her easy to talk to, and very enthusiastic about her ritual work. If you're tired of getting promised an experience, and coming away disappointed, then you need to go see the Rev. My experience was WAY more than I expected, and we ran over on time a little with no extra donation required. That was nice, but I tipped her for her efforts anyway.

As it turns out villain has 98 and not a flush anyway because he has no idea what he doing, but even then it not the short term results that matter but the reasoning behind your actions.Turn sucks, river even worse, and you still 3barreled your whole stack in never considering you could be beat, with the last barrel being double pot. That verrrrry spewy.Is it because I am in first position that a lead out is bad on the flop?? Say if im in last position and everybody checks then would a lead out be bad. Because I dont think i should be giving flush draws a free card.I understand now that the jam on the river is a huge mistake as good players wont fold their flush draws there.The guy was counting the cards on the board, im sure he had some sort of straight so that takes out all flush possibilities, with that information how would you play the river when a club comes out?Yeah he could be counting as a false tell but hes a fish and so am i apparently.I play my tournaments at all pubs across Melbourne Australia this was one of them where the buy in was $50 feild is decent.

It takes great skill to pretend you've got a low hand but keep your opponents thinking otherwise and experienced opponents will have seen every trick in the book many times. The way you bet, the amount you bet, the amount of time it takes you to bet and the difference in the way you play one hand over your previous hands all influence those who know what to look for.

Yeah, but thats because the government uses its tools of force to prevent that. If the government disappeared tomorrow, then the Tony Sopranos of the world fight it out until one of them has enough firepower to enforce his sovereignty, and then you have a regular old government. Perhaps you could say, government should be kept small and local and should not be allowed to do what it did at Waco, and I would agree with that but that not anarchism thats just being conservative.. 
The point of the 3 bet is to fold out hands (squeezing, rarely happens in live poker), limit your opponents range (live poker isnt happening), make the pot bigger so if you hit your hand on the flop you can get max value, and make the pot bigger to go all in with the best hand preflop.

It also follows some disappointment about the fast feeder's marketing strategy. Last year, McDonald's admitted that at times it had put too much emphasis on national campaigns rather than local ones.

I was interviewing for a job at one of the companies whose products we resell. They were offering a much more interesting position dealing with things I already had prior knowledge of. The interview generally went well, but it lasted for close to three hours and I was told of so many things that had nothing to do with the position. The interviewer had been listing tasks for an hour before she got into what the open position would be, which was completely different from what she had been talking about. She asked me about my grades in high shool, from which I graduated in 2011. When she asked what about the job ad had caught my attention, I listed off some of the things just to remind myself and she said "oh, that is definitely part of the job, this couldn have been on the ad". It was. I cheked later. The other two people were completely silent almost all of the interview and one of them was sitting so far away from the others I could not look at her comfortably to include her.

Whether he meant it to be funny or not, he doing what you claim is negative.

In other cases when the person said that he is "all in," this just means that he is betting all the chips that he has. He is taking that risk of winning back what he bet or losing the game. Sometimes, individuals do this to intimidate the other players and to make them think that he has a really nice hand. The problem is he can just be using this as a bluffing strategy to make the other players fold and stop competing with him in the round.

This is likely the correct answer. When mixing thick purees in a blender like hummus, you experience what called cavitation, which is when a pocket of air is created around the blade and the blade doesn get enough contact with the food in order to blend it properly. That why you constantly have to scrape down the sides/stir or add more liquid. Blendtec twister jar solves this problem. The Vitamix tamper also solves this problem. If OP doesn have a blendtec or Vitamix, then making hummus in a blender is still possible but just more difficult. A food processor would be a better tool in that case.

The best comps are associated with games in which the casino has a more significant edge and likewise stands to make more money: Those dollar slots, 3  and 4  card poker and Caribbean Stud are good examples. Contrary to common belief, games like blackjack, roulette and craps aren't actually the biggest moneymakers for casinos, so it's unlikely they'll will give free rooms to anyone who plays moderately at these tables.

Clever casino players usually try to realize their casino bonuses quickly   somebody stakes the entire amount on chances, in the hope to double it (just imagine, you stake all $200 on chances, with a probability of 49% you'll win neat $200, with a probability of 51% you'll lose your $100 and $100 of the bonus, that is to say, a stake has positive math expectancy for you $2000,49 $1000,51=$47), some casino players use progressive strategies of Martingale type. It is recommended to fix the desired amount of your gain, for example $200, and try to win it, taking risks.

NTA   I can't speak for everyone in the military, but I know that myself and my coworkers (all active duty) hate when civilians try to cop that. They don't have to get up and run 3 miles every day, they didn't sign their lives away for 4 or 6 years (they can quit any time), they know when they get to go home, they usually don't deploy (usually contractors), and they don't wear the uniform. It's a hard life, but it is one we chose. With that, some places are generous enough to remind us that they remember our sacrifices, and give us that discount. It's small, but it's meaningful to us. Someone who hasn't done the above doesn't deserve to abuse their kindness like that.

Childbirth isn done in public because it requires medical intervention. Even back in the day with no hospitals, women were still taken to a private place to give birth.

Trust isOptionalWe need players, rules, and the game needs to identify players. Because the individual players may not know or trust each other, we need a way to secure the players.

What happened to all the people who said they come? He got over it, continued to invite the people and last year had around 60 people actually come, enjoy themselves, and thank him later. Personally, I would not have been so forgiving! But as others have said, it definitely has something to do with the impersonality of "parties" or any group invitation, people thank you for the information and wish to be supportive, but they consider it an entertainment option for the day, like movie listings say the movie is playing but you don decide to go until the last minute because nobody really cares if you, personally, attend, it happens the same with or without you.

I think this context is important. It hard to say what would have happened had they followed his plan to a T but it probably would have had more of a shot than sitting around avoiding losing dated ships.

I had AskedMeFi recently about any standalone poker games for OS X and was tipped off to pokerroom; it's certainly better than anything I could download (because apparently the AI available on the different Mac games sucks, whereas the real people you play with are much more reasonably irrational)..

Just because you are in the top 10% of players does not mean you are the best player at the table (even in a 9 person table). You can be the 5th best player at the table at all times, but the 5 good players play many more hours and stay at the table for 8 hour straight while the other 4 seats rotate with an endless stream of fish who donate money. You can end a session with the same 5 at the table for 8 hours, but have 45 people rotate through the other 4 seats in those 8 hours, making you top 5 out of 45 people. This is a slight exaggeration because people don rotate that quickly, but there are a lot of people who fill up those seats to lose money.

Misdeclaring is an angle because as seen here players will muck prematurely out of frustration etc thinking that the dealer has verified the hand or that if you are lying you lose. I've never seen someone repeatedly misdeclare a hand at showdown after being warned about it but I would hope many floors would potentially kill a hand and award a pot to the other player if it continues.

I guess King wanted the book to be about something other than just the Kennedy assassination and thought he could add some heart to the story at the same time.

Further, although other studies have suggested that CCD related mortality in honey bee colonies may come from bees' reduced resistance to mites or parasites as a result of exposure to pesticides, the new study found that bees in the hives exhibiting CCD had almost identical levels of pathogen infestation as a group of control hives, most of which survived the winter. This finding suggests that the neonicotinoids are causing some other kind of biological mechanism in bees that in turn leads to CCD.

Now with touch phones, people in very isolated places can do banking or get news with apps. When I was a small child my parents had a phone, but it was a large box on the wall and had a crank that they turned when they wanted to make a call.

Even so, I can help but love what we got for this series.

The use of 3D printing is already transforming many conventional industries. For example, GE is able to replace a third of the parts on an aircraft engine using 3D printing and by fusing materials together they can reduce the overall number of parts. Honda created an electric vehicle entirely from 3D printed segments. On demand printed cars may be just around the corner. Even homes are being 3D printed at highly reasonable costs these days although a bit rudimentary, the output can only get better. It will reduce transportation and waste and thus help to minimize emissions. It may also reduce the overall cost for consumers while increasing local jobs.

I had this problem as well. It went black randomly for no reason at all. I panicked as I thought i had a dead beat monitor. But after a while, it worked and showed a display. All i can remember was it had picture on the screen saying it could not find an input even when I made sure my plugs were connected, and the power button was lit up. Also, the other buttons didn respond when i was pressing it. So the only solution i can really give you is wait for it to do something. Maybe keep it unplugged to discharge the monitor for a minute or so, and try again?

Listen, I know you don't want to hear "break up", but it's legit your only choice. You will either have no kid and he grows resentment/try to sabotage your birth control (which has happened on this sub) or you do and you're not only miserable, but you possibly take it out on the kid after sleep deprivation and a possible divorce anyway. You two want very different things, it's unfair to ask him to give up his dream to have children just like it's unfair for him to ask that of you when you don't want to. It's hard, but it's the only way you will be happy. Take it as a lesson to learn, make your intentions up front with any new partner and say you won't change, if they keep pressuring you leave. You both deserve to be happy, don't you think?

Everyone is always telling her she should open a cake or cupcake shop, etc. Beyond the risks of trying to operate a competitive and profitable bakery, nobody ever considers the fact that baking 10 hours a day would get old within the first week; that you can just train some hourly wage high school kids to be as good as you or to care 1/10th as much as you; or that you really can expect to maintain your small batch standards of immaculate perfection across hundreds of cupcakes per day, every day, forever..

You want to smooth the piezo output (someone mentioned dedicated ICs for this), then run the output to a battery charge controller so you don overload whatever kind of batteries you using. Once you done that, solder on a USB connector to the battery output and you be able to use a USB power meter (search ebay). You won be measuring the output of each step directly, but it would give you a good average output if you calculate it.

At NL2 3betting can be very profitable since most players over fold (fold too much) to 3bets and generally continue with a very strong range. As long as you don spew money with top pair post flop, then 3betting in position with suited connectors and A2s A5s (especially BTN vs CO) can be very profitable. Do it occasionally with these hands (because they have reasonable equity against premium hands) and all the time with your premium hands (JJ+, AQ+, KQ).

Environment and Climate Change Canada said it has issued a permit for Ottawa Bluesfest organizers to move the killdeer and its four eggs to a nearby suitable habitat.Mark Monahan, Bluesfest executive director, said an official who has a federal licence to handle migratory birds started work Tuesday evening to move the eggs."We're hopefully going to have the nest and the eggs to a safe location by the end of the day," Monahan said, adding that setup work on the stages should start soon."It's not ideal, but we have enough time," he said. "We may have to work some extra hours, but we should be fine."Environment and Climate Change Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the relocation will allow the nest to remain   and the eggs to hatch   in a natural environment.The bird and its eggs   both of which enjoy protected status in Canada   were nestled on a cobblestone patch that would normally be directly underneath the main Bluesfest stage.Workers came across the killdeer last week when they arrived at the festival venue, which is being set up for a July 5 start date.What the workers described was an agitated bird   the usual defensive habits of an adult killdeer when a threat or intruder has come too close to its nest.Organizers put up yellow caution tape in place around the nest site, and the National Capital Commission paid for 24 hour security on ground overseen by the federal agency.Eggs generally take between 24 and 26 days to hatch, and it is unusual for them not to hatch by mid June. Killdeer young are able to fly away soon after they are hatched, but there was no way to know whether they would hatch quickly.Killdeer are not considered a species at risk, although their domestic numbers in Canada have been on the decline over the last four decades.Still, moving the nest required federal approval, which arrived ahead of a deadline that would have caused a cascade of construction problems for the 11 day festival, which gets underway next week.Monika Melichar of Woodlands Wildlife Sanctuary in Minden, Ont., some 300 kilometres west of Ottawa, began the painstaking move by placing a replica nest with the eggs inside near the real one.The mother killdeer flew away at first, but returned a short time later, resting on the replica nest."These birds are good   the parents haven't given up yet," Melichar said.She will be moving the nest one metre every 20 minutes until it reaches its new home about 30 metres away from where the stage will be located.But if the mother abandons the eggs, which is a possibility, the eggs will be transported to a facility where they have the best chance of survival.The nest' new home is far enough away that the birds won't be disturbed by the hundreds of thousands of music fans who will trample through the festival grounds to see the likes of Shawn Mendes, Bryan Adams, Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band, among a host of other acts."There was a big learning curve, those of us involved with the festival had to quickly get up to speed on what needed to be done, so certainly it's not something we'd like to go through again," Monahan said.
