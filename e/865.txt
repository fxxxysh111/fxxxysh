As I am in the middle of nowhere, it is pouring rain, pitch dark, and 42 degrees outside I be lying if I said I wasn crazy bummed about a missed adventure and whatever is going on with my car/how much it might cost to be fixed. But I am at least grateful for all the day hiking I did this week, for peanut butter M for warm layers, and you better believe I grateful for AAA. Also, the day before yesterday a very difficult and closed off non verbal autistic kiddo held my hand as I walked him out of the treatment room.

Can maybe 4 bet AJs, but even that of questionable EV. You can maybe get away with flatting 77 TT. Live winrates depend vastly on player pool so if you a 10 bb/hour winner at one card room, you can just take that number, account for the difference in rake, and automatically assume you going to be a winner at that winrate.

I like to stay below $200 but if I can find a set I really like I pay more, the only thing is I don really like the way normal chips look and I want this set for aesthetic as well. As far as cards go there are some extravagant looking cards that don cost much at all but the whole while I searched for chips I have yet to find ones that don look like spinoffs of the original style of chip. The best example I can find is these borrowed time chips but they are overly expensive:

As much as the marginal gains in delayed commercial deliveries can help extend the life of a series and justify a higher unit cost, the devolution of live scripted series viewing is making it more difficult for the networks to meet advertisers' expectations. Agency execs believe that more than three quarters of the people who watch TV on their own schedule zip or zap through the ads, and it's unlikely that such avoidance behaviors will be unlearned. Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.

I try to stay up to date with what going on in the Haskell community, but even so I missed out on the FPCo survey too. Hopefully that means they were targeting a different group of people, like perhaps C level executives. Regardless, I will make a point to work with them over the course of the next year to either combine our surveys or increase the visibility of their survey. I don expect that to remove selection bias, but it will let me (us, really) say: We doing this together for the benefit of all sides. And if people have problems with the survey, I want them to feel comfortable trying to fix those problems, even if they not on my said: "A question did you hear about this survey   this could at least help to disentangle outreach bias, or notice it, depending on if it induces any correlations." And I replied: "Asking how people heard about the survey is a great idea. Not only would it let me identify the best ways to reach people, it could also be useful in dealing with selection bias." And then indeed the survey did include that very question.

But before playing a serious game of poker with your friends, check whether playing for real money is legal within your area. While some areas permit small stakes poker games among at home, some places have stricter gambling laws. It is a fine idea to note the risks of an open low stakes game. 
Thank you, you speak the truth. I work at a bike shop and oh my god, if I had a nickle for every time I saw a damaged Schwinn or Mongoose come into the shop, I would have like, uh, lots of nickles. The saddest part is that most of the people buying those bikes at Walmart or Target aren even aware that they buying garbage, and then they come into our shop pissed that their wheel is bent or their brake caliper snapped off, when they "just got this thing 2 weeks ago." I once had a guy come in with a brand new Schwinn that sprang a flat just as he was taking it out of the local Walmart to his car. He hadn even had time to take off the stickers on the handlebars and frame yet. The prevailing wisdom is that a $200 bike is actually more like an $800 bike after all the maintenance work you have to pay for. Do not ever go big box for a bicycle. Go local.

While many people enjoy their home poker game for its comraderie, others want to walk away winners. Particularly for the skilled player, the home poker game can be a continual source of frustration because the poker played there is so unlike the poker one reads about in book after book after book written on the subject.

If you're concerned about your son being pulled out for the majority of the day, make sure to address and speak up about his service delivery time. When making an IEP, the services are described as X times per week for X amount of minutes; if you feel that the service delivery their offering is too much, address it. However, I will say, there are many special education teachers that do wonders for students and help close their educational gaps. I don't recall if you mentioned what grade your son is in, but elementary grade special education teachers are able to spend a lot more time with students (small group or 1 on 1), but once your son gets to middle and high school that may change. I'm sure it varies by state, but in my state middle and high schools use the co teaching model where special education teachers attend the core classes and provide service delivery within those classes (no pull out time); this inevitably means that many students do not get all the attention they need, sometimes there are upwards of 15 students in the core class with IEPs and the special education teacher is trying to deliver services to all of them at the same time while the normal class lesson and instructions are being delivered by the gen ed teacher. Just an opinion, if my child was still in elementary school, I would want all the attention he could get while he has the resources elementary schools have. Instructional intensity is one of the most recommended strategies for dyslexia, including more time, smaller groups, targeted at individual reading level, systematic sequence of delivery, extensive opportunity and feedback.

Also as far as weapon combinations I feel like laser plus missile combo is a waste. Lasers bypass shields completely but the missiles fare very poorly against shields. So if somebody has a build with decent armor and shields you splitting your firepower between some lasers nibbling at armor and your missiles all hitting shields and point defenses. Better from my experience to either stack one weapon type, or do a combo including high rate of fire ballistics.

A star is one parsec away if it moves in a little circle with a radius of one arc second (1/60th of 1/60th of one degree) over a year. If its little circle is half an arc second, it two parsecs away. If it 1/10th of an arc second, it 10 parsecs away. So, given that astronomers like using arc seconds to measure angles in the sky, using parsecs makes the mathematics really simple. It a geometric unit that we can measure directly. Light years are less direct, because we can directly time how long it takes light to reach us from a distant star   we have to calculate it from the speed of light and the distance.

The virulently feminist students just sort of shrugged, so maybe I'm really not onto something here. But isn't describing the surface of female politicians their hair, their clothes, their shoes just another way of minimizing the content of their ideas? And isn't that part of a larger misogyny?

Momentarily forgetting the wisdom of Batman, I made the wrong decision to take a shortcut through an alleyway when a junkie jumped out and made a move for the cash box. Unfortunately, unlike the time David Copperfield was almost robbed but used his training to convince the robber he had nothing in his pockets, my guy already had my money in his hands, leaving me no other choice but to wrestle him for it. That's when he pulled out a kitchen knife and plunged it into my left side, just above the hip bone.
I mean, that's just not true. A lot of what ICE does is try to prevent human trafficking. There's a lot of reasons why there's issues involved in catching traffickers. That's not to downplay what Kutcher and Moore have done, but to say there's practically no efforts being given is absurd and untrue. Saying that discredits all of the actual good work that law enforcement agents have dedicated their lives to doing. And it's certainly not an easy job that they do, that takes a huge toll on people.

There are probably aspects of control / government power / censorship of ideas at some level. But I recall the initial censorship started back when there were all these kids and men who would get online and gamble until their eyes fell out or they were broke.

In the right circumstances, however, the player sometimes will break up a flush, a straight, or a pair of jacks or better. If you do not have one of the "always keep" hands, use the following list. Possible predraw hands are listed in order. Find the highest listing that fits your predraw hand, and discard any cards that do not fit the hand. For example, if your hand includes jack of spades, jack of diamonds, 10 of diamonds, 9 of diamonds, and 8 of diamonds, you have four cards to an open straight flush in diamonds, and you also have a pair of jacks or better. The four card open straight flush is higher on the list than the pair of jacks or better, so you would discard the jack of spades and draw to the four card straight flush. You are giving up the certain 1 for 1 payoff for a pair of jacks, but you have a chance at a straight flush with either a queen or 7 of diamonds, could draw a flush with any other diamond, or still could finish with a pair of jacks by drawing the jack of either clubs or hearts.

Because handguns are easier to use, easy to conseal, lightweight, you can more easily find compatible ammo, magazines, and even carry several magazines in your pockets, they are very easy to reload quickly, and many have as many bullets in a mag as a legal rifle magazine. Also anyone who says that dual weilding pistols is impossible or even all that impractical is wrong. They are more accurate that one would think, easy to fix in the field, easier to suppress with items simply found around us, they are often not as loud as a rifle, and certainly quieter than a shotgun, they do not have a short range, they are honestly harder to fumble or drop, less recoil means faster refire while retaining a general ammount of accuracy, and 9mm (the most common pistol round) can penetrate most surfaces at close range. This is all assuming that we talking about a glock or M9. Magnums, revolvers, and other large round handguns are also common (though significantly less than say a glock), a 44. Round is strong enough that a shot to the chest comes with enough force to throw you on the ground like youve been shoved by someone twice your size, for comparison, a 9mm feels like a hard punch, six of these can be held in some revolvers, and can cause fatal trauma in a single shot to most areas of the torso, there are also semi automatic handguns that fire this round. There are also automatic handguns, magazines can have all manner of sizes of extended magazine, which, are difficult to aquire, though not impossible, and often the largest pistol magazines hold more than a rifle magazine.

Someone called in claiming the phones weren working, so I started doing basic troubleshooting, and turns out the internet was completely down.

Let me preface this by saying that instant cameras are not really a great replacement for traditional 35mm film, especially in this day and age. 35mm film is far more versatile and, with the newer formulas for films like Kodak Portra and CineStill, are far more translatable to digital than any instant film that is currently in production..

Higher education should not be distributed on the basis of wealth, but on the merits of the student. Nearly all industrialized countries (and many industrializing countries), this is an obvious fact.

When someone gives a lecture on a college campus, they can more or less say whatever they want to say since they are protected both by the principles of free speech and academic freedom. However, when a college throws its institutional weight behind someone  for instance, by inviting them to commencement or naming an endowned chair after them, the stakes are much higher and the symbolic weight of that person speech much heavier.
