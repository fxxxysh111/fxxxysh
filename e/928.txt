If you notice a tight player folding more than is optimal, than bluffing more than optimal is going to be the best strategy to make a profit. (Full Answer).

Technically, a small business owner would be what we call "petit bourgeois", essentially middle class rather than working class as such. However, that doesnt mean artisans and corner shop owners are the enemy of socialists. A socialist government would nationalise the commanding heights of the economy  the huge billion dollar industries and the banks. Under a nationalised economy these artisans would benefit from decent loans on the basis of banks run for need not profit.

The promotion would pick a random table every hour (usually between 8:15 AM and 10:15 PM) and if your table was picked, everyone dealt in the hand got at least $100 (I think it was $200 on Friday and Saturday). Not every table was eligible (like the higher staked games), but all the $1/$3 tables WERE eligible. 
I haven run the math on a typical EV regarding that promotion, but I hit Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and then on my last day (Tuesday), I hit THREE times. That money was rolled into my buyin and buyout numbers.

Fun fact! It is actually cheaper in the long run to just give homeless people homes than let them stay homeless. If they don have shelter and healthcare they get much sicker and end up at emergency where treating them is more expensive. If you give someone a steady place to live they have a much better chance of getting a job and being able to contribute more to society and the economy. And many people become homeless because of an existing health condition that isn being properly treated eg because they can afford it. But generally people don like the idea of just giving away things they had to work for, so politicians don like to change towards social housing or healthcare, and everyone ends up paying more overall and making homeless people suffer

If an ICO (initial coin offering) for a company has a unique concept that investors are interested in, it's important to get proof of that concept out to market as quickly as possible. By getting in early, you can develop the necessary foundation to expand market penetration, coverage, and investment opportunities. Entrepreneurs across the board will tell you that without risk, there is no reward. If you're looking to play it safe on every single hand, you're never going to win the monster pots. Sometimes you have to take that leap of faith, and that's what poker teaches you.

But too many commentators on the left and the right have accepted the ridiculous idea that the Obama administration is actually socialist. Time to do our homework and show that the Emporer New Clothes may just be the same ol neoliberal con job of making the rich richer gussied up as populist policy.What if the result of all this consolidation of financial power in the hands of a few is that the rich get richer? There is no guarantee that the economic collapse is going to result in a redistribution of wealth, despite the screams of socialism coming from Fox News commentators.In fact, some experts are suggesting that what is really going on is that class interests are being protected by Secretary Geithner and his gang. In other words, there may be a veneer of populism in the new administration rhetoric, but it is disguising the same old class interests and the consolidation of wealth in the hands of the few that has been going on under the guise of neoliberalism for three decades.If Harvey right and what we seeing is the continuation of the consolidation of wealth and assets rather than the reversal of this trend, then it time for an organized and concentrated effort by the media and grass roots movements to reveal what going on.

I can defend security. I was going in and out of the store multiple times during the weekend (albeit via blink) but the regular line was never super long except on the first day, which is of course when people are buying all the stuff they expect to sell out. If you not doing Blink shopping, you can complain about the store line   those people are choosing to be there. Most of the most popular stuff (especially key art stuff) has always sold out by the close of the opening ceremony. Last year when I was trying to buy pins in the DMF area I waited 3 hours just to get into the room. Not saying the lines are great, but last year it was managed way better than in years past.

The Volcano has the air pump before the bowl so this is no issue.It depends what your goal is. If you want to make a volcano, take a Mighty apart, fit an air pump on the air inlet to the heating element and do it that way. Your Mighty is then unusable as a normal portable.If you do it the quick way and fit an air pump to where the cooling chamber would be, it won last long and you would have to be careful with materials used.Also, the heating element may not be up to the job of having continuous air flow.

The Paleo Coach is really intended for a general audience. Seib makes two assumptions: that paleo is the "natural human diet" and will help you lose weight and improve your health, and that you're going to have a tough time sticking with it, since giving up grains and dairy is a seismic nutritional shift for most Americans. "There are only two reasons people fail," Seib writes, "lack of good information, and lack of motivation." He does a good job providing both.
Right at the start here I like to say I know nothing about the Chicago subway system I would however like to share this little gem on it that I just found.

6 months later I go for my annual eye exam to update my contact prescription. Two minutes in, the doctor says I have amblyopia in my right eye caused by my prior ptosis. It turns out I'm incredibly lucky that it's so mild (20/25 is rare with the severity of ptosis I had and how long it took to get it fixed), but my eyebrow muscles were compensating and lifting my lid enough to prevent major damage.

The scope of the experiments and projects increased dramatically when confronted with the reality of an entire planet to use as a research lab, and that of course meant the footprint of the facilities and staff grew much larger. A true colony effectively had to be created just to enable the research projects to continue, which by default meant that the facilities became a prosperous human colony and attractive to interstellar migrants.

2010: Eventually, however, I started to figure out a few things. I made friends with some other poker players and actually began to discuss hands and read forums like 2+2. I discovered Holdem Manager and realized that I was just clicking buttons aimlessly. By 2010 I was making some reasonable money online. 1 2bb/100 playing 200nl rush on Full Tilt. However, rakeback was absolutely insane at this time. By putting in 100 200k hands a month, I was somehow getting something near $10k in rakeback. Blackcard gave somewhere around 40% rakeback and then there were rake races and affiliate bonuses that I also got. So even with being only a slightly winning player, simply by putting in the volume I could make decent money. I was in school at this time so couldn put in as much volume as I wanted, but I knew that if the poker landscape stayed the same, I could make a living out of it.

All that to say from my limited experience in poker, when most people say they love to go pro, they likely much better off keeping it as a hobby. It easy to get tunnel vision with "I love playing," "I can win several hunderd in a few hours, can do that at my job" "no boss or timeclock". They don think about going to work for 1, 2, sometimes 3 or more weeks and losing money. Downswings aren the only downfall. Do you drink? How much? Do you play games in the pit? Sports bet? I seen people handle upswings worse than they handle downswings.

Well it not, but you need to take it seriously and be willing to put in the hours like you do now. When poker your job, every decision you make is + or  ev, set a plan, set goals and priorities then set about a way to achieve them.

A deficiency of both spleen qi and heart blood produces dizziness, poor appetite, and fatigue, with a pale face and tongue. This pattern often appears in students after excessive studying. The standard formula for this pattern is Kwei Be Wan. In addition, longan (long yan rou) fruit can be eaten as is or boiled in a decoction. It is sold in dried form, but in tropical climates it can sometimes be found fresh. It nourishes the heart blood, making it a good supplement to herbal therapy. If the underlying disharmony is liver and kidney yin deficiency, symptoms are fatigue, blurry vision, low back pain, sexual dysfunction, leg weakness, and night sweats. The treatment principle is to tonify liver and kidney yin with Rehmannia Teapills. Another tasty fruit, Lycium berries (gou qi zi), can be added as a supplement for this pattern. The berries replenish the yin of the liver and kidneys, nourish the blood, and improve eyesight. The best quality fruit is brownish and soft and can be eaten as is, cooked into cereal, or boiled in a decoction. When anemia is the result of spleen and kidney yang deficiency, fatigue, a pale face and tongue, lack of libido, cold limbs, and loose stools can occur. Moxibustion is especially helpful in this pattern. Also, the person should avoid cold foods. In this case, a good patent remedy is Nu Ke Ba Zhen Wan, which tonifies both qi and blood. In addition, a decoction made of 10 grams dried ginger and 10 grams cinnamon bark tonifies the yang qi.

The Boulder District Attorney's Office has also filed two crime of violence sentencing enhancements in the case.Prosecutors allege that Collins struck 71 year old Katie Kulpa in the head with a fire poker at her Lefthand Canyon residence in September, fracturing her skull and nearly killing her.Prosecutors also allege that Collins who had open charges from an unrelated incident at the time of the alleged attack cut off his ankle monitor when he fled and altered his appearance to avoid capture.However, testimony revealed that Collins suffered a chaotic childhood, which resulted in stunted emotional development and left him less mature than the average 16 year old.Collins also reportedly suffers from multiple mental health and substance abuse issues that have been left largely untreated. He was hospitalized twice in the year leading up to the alleged attack on Kulpa for "suicide and/or drug overdose," records show.Kulpa had taken in Collins and his two friends after they became stranded in the mountains near Ward in September.

Athletes have fairly stable plaques instead of the unstable mix of calcium and lipids seen in unhealthy people, and stable plaques don rupture as easily and cause heart attacks.In the case of endurance athletes, the hardening and thickening of arteries is most likely a natural process and not really a "disease."Interestingly though they categorized them as either 3000+METmin/wk or less than 1500METmin/wk so if I understand that correctly it means high activity (not necessarily endurance athletes just self reported as highly active) versus not so active (including all the way down to no exercise per week).

The weighted risk difference in perineal traumas that required suturing was  0.23 (95% CI:  0.35,  0.11) in favour of avoiding episiotomy, compared with liberal episiotomy (n=4,631). This is equivalent to an absolute decrease of 23% in the risk of sutured perineal trauma. Avoiding routine episiotomy in 4.4 women would prevent one case of perineal trauma that required suturing. The risk difference was similar when the only trial of median episiotomy was excluded. There was significant heterogeneity between the trials that was not eliminated by excluding any one trial. When including only the 3 trials with a high quality score, the risk difference was reduced to  0.14 (95% CI:  0.27, +0.01), but there was still significant heterogeneity. No difference was shown in anal sphincter trauma (n=4,650).

Sometimes you will be in a hand at the river against two opponents while you have the best low hand and they are both raising. It is extremely likely that you will be quartered in this situation, and you must decide if there is enough money already in the pot to warrant calling all of the raises. Against two opponents, if you have a low and it is quartered, every dollar you put into the pot will return only 75 cents to you..

His stunning lack of depth regarding his proposals.   Any time he has been really pressed to explain his proposals, and how they could become reality, he fails.

Didn we hate it that Trump supporters seemed to believe everything he boasted about during the election? How "he alone would fix it". Yet, aren Bernie supporters just a naive and gullible? Why do we mock Trump supporters, yet fail to look at ourselves in the mirror?

For some ChIP seq examples, some transcriptional activators and repressors work by binding near gene promoters and interacting with the transcriptional machinery there directly. Because of this, you would tend to annotate these proteins in relation to transcription start sites. On the other hand, there are certain proteins you would expect to be over gene bodies. These would include proteins like the RNA polymerase, and certain histone modifying enzymes (and the marks they themselves modify). There are other proteins whose expected regions of binding are a little less well defined in relations to genes. These could include proteins that bind to enhancers, and other proteins involved in 3D chromatin architecture, such as cohesin and CTCF. It may not necessarily be informative to annotate these naively in relation to gene features, but rather other higher order DNA architecture annotations would be better instead.

After all, she represents me, an American, and is respected for how she looks in a bathing suit, so of course I want to base my understanding of the world on what she thinks.

I like what they've done to flesh out his character in the series. Whether it was for that purpose, or to serve as a red herring, I believe they made it abundantly clear how compliant he was in Adora's torture. In this episode alone: he consoles Amma by offering her cake (unbeknownst to Adora), and he confronts Adora by telling her to cool it with the "medicine" (but then backs off and says it's "her area"). However, the BIGGEST kicker to me was when he cranked up his music to the nines (to hide any other sounds in the house, maybe?) and then tells Dick a blatant lie concerning Camille's whereabouts. He might've been able to just say "she isn't feeling well," but HE KNEW BETTER than to draw suspicion. Ohhhh Alan.

Herbology. Herbs and flowers were probably among the first ways human beings treated sickness. We also know that animals will eat plants in response to certain illnesses. Today, some of our most widely used medications and treatments are plant derived, including digitalis (foxglove), for certain heart conditions, and pyrethrins (chrysanthemums), a main ingredient in many flea control products. The chemicals in herbal remedies have been found to strengthen the immune system, provide relief from pain, and calm the mind.

Much like a plastic protector covers the end of your shoelace, telomeres keep chromosome ends from fraying, which keeps an organism's genetic information intact. Without telomeres, cells could not divide without losing genes. However, as cells divide, which they do throughout our lives to replenish skin and other organs, telomeres shrink. Once telomeres are too small, cells stop dividing and our skin (and other organs) begin to degrade. The shortening of telomeres has not only been linked to aging, but also to cancer and increased risk of death.

I seriously looked into this in college, it isn as easy as it sounds. First off they judge you like you wouldn believe on health, family history, appearance, grades and standardized test scores, etc. the higher you score combined in all the categories the more they will offer for your eggs, if they want them at all after evaluating you thoroughly.

Heck, I don think it important in a poem either haha. Of course it an important tool, but the sing songy poems with all end rhymes, those are sort of a thing of the past. Rhymes are used internally, within the lines quite a bit, but freeverse poetry is much more common these days. It that same mentality that forcing a poem to rhyme but sacrificing the quality of the poem isn worth it. If you can maintain quality and rhyme and rhyming suits the poem, then that awesome, but rhyming shouldn be more important than the message or story or idea being conveyed. Which is great because I suck at rhyming lol.

You are oversimplifying what Hilary said to support this WWIII argument. The crucial point is that her rhetoric and threats might have actually given Russia pause over their actions in the region. Why is it that when Hilary speaks everything is taken literally but Donald Trumps statements during the debate about firing weapons on Iranian ships is completely ignored. Bottom line is you can give either case benefit of doubt if you view their statements through the lens of geopolitical posturing. The charge that, as you put it, "she WANTED to go to war with Russia." Really? You think she "wanted" it? Literally no one on this planet "wants" that. The idea is stupid on it face and is traceable directly back to Russian state media.
