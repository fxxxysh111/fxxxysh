Belgian director Bouli Lanners brings us his third feature length film, "The Giants," about three youngsters spending a summer in rural Belgium on their own. With their mother out of the country, teenage brothers Seth and Zak fend for themselves, surviving on dwindling funds and living in their deceased grandfather's country house. One day, while driving around the countryside, they meet 15 year old Dany, and a friendship quickly blossoms among them. Unrestricted by parental control, the three teenagers relish their independence. We watch them dodge cops, smoke weed, camp around a bonfire, shoot birds, break into solitary homes, dye their hair for no reason, talk about girls and dream about a spirited future in Spain.
Ugh! Went through this with my DD. My GMIL and SFIL are Soooo just yes ( even after over a decade after we broke up they have been a huge part of my support system) However FIL and SMIL criticized everything because she was a kindergarten teacher. TBH she gave me some awesome resources. for 5 yos. when DD was less than two and I didn't immediately start using them, because duh, and she got super upset! She wanted to parent my child I was so grateful that distance and selfishness kept them away for the most part. At 13 she is VERY inoculated to JNOs because of my mother ( something I realized I put her through recently and still trying to process. proud she knows not to pander to the bullshit but wishing she never had to. Been tempted to post about my own issues especially as no contact is on the horizon and I'm scared my spine isn't shiny enough. fwiw this sub has been awesome for making me realize how bad it really is and not wanting to subject my daughter to it forever)

You get a temporary credit score boost. That because all they do is (fraudulently) dispute all your negative items and spam all your creditors with debt validation letters. While your negative items are being disputed, they stop affecting your score. But as soon as the dispute is resolved (in their favor, assuming they valid debts), they go right back on. And nobody is going to give you a loan while you have active disputes, so the "credit boost" is worthless.

Serotonin imbalances are known to be associated with mood disorders, specifically depression. Dopamine, too, plays a role in mood; think of it as the reward and pleasure hormone. A study published in the International Journal of Neuroscience found that massage therapy had a positive impact on the levels of serotonin and dopamine in the body, which translates into a positive impact on our mood. Serotonin levels increased an average of 28 percent after a massage session, and dopamine by an average of 31 percent. Massage also helps lower the levels of the stress hormone cortisol in our bodies by an average of 31 percent [source: Field]. This hormone is involved in our fight and flight response and when we have too much circulating through our body we're at risk for chronic inflammation and a weakened immune system.

Thumb bird. Place your thumbs together and stretch your palms out, as if you were miming a bird. Place your thumbs on the centre of the baby's stomach and wrap your hands around the waist. (the tips of your thumbs should come up just above the belly button). Now separate your thumbs, stroking across the stomach and round the baby's sides. Arms and Hands Milk the arm, making sure you get into all the creases, especially behind the elbow. Roll the arm Stroke the back of the hand, starting at the wrist and going down over the top of each finger in turn Do the same on the palm of the hand. As you reach the tip of each finger, give it a little roll between your fingers. Draw small circles around the knobbly wrist bone Armpit   raise your baby's arm above their head and flat onto the towel. (If your baby stiffens their arm, try jiggling it gently from the elbow until they relax.) Now with the other hand stroke down the inside of the upper arm, into the cavity of the armpit, and off. Make sure this one is firm, so that it does not tickle. Movements: holding it by the wrist, take one arm down to the baby's side, then up and across to the opposite collarbone, in the style of a Roman salute. make sure you return the arm to the baby's side afterwards Do this five times with each hand. Now take a wrist in one hand, and the opposite foot in the other. bring the two together, meeting somewhere over the baby's belly button. Make sure that you return both limbs to he ground between movements. repeat five times with each side. Legs and Feet Start with the left leg

The other guy made one last comment before he got banned from the forum. I would imagine he lying to you about a lot of things, including how profitable he is at poker. Get proactive about this now. Get on your facebook group, 2p2 marketplace, anywhere you can and name and shame him. It entirely possible that he oversold to the sat (did you really make the offer to him, or did he start saying "Oh man, the national championships are coming up and I know I crush in them, if only all my money wasn tied up with this move.") or that he doing or is planning to steal from other people. The best thing for you to do is to get him to buy you out of your equity ($900) since you can really trust that he going to pay you. It would be a bit rich for me to go to the fb group etc cos I was telling the other guy how it is none of his business what deal we do and saying that he was just jealous that he couldn play in the big game etc and my friend got that guy banned from the group, he a bit of a minor celebrity in poker circles in my town/country so I don want to rock the boat too much. I will be at the tournament to get my 10% if he does cash though for sure and I don think I will be making any more deals with him based on the feedback here. I asked him about this and he said that the other guy was just a jealous loser and reiterated the numbers so I don think I am going to get more than 10%.

Cuts and Stitches. Aside from getting yourself a good pair of scissors, learning how to make basic stitches are also important. If you selected a pretty fragile cover material for your microbeads, you can't expect the sewing machine to do all that handiwork for you. If you are a knitting fan, you can try bump stitching.

She may be a great person/smoking hot/out of your league, but she isn't likely great enough for anyone, including you, to sacrifice their twenties and thirties for (as well as the dreams you might have of having stable minded kids of your own). Be prepared, though, for her to raise hell if you try to back out. She is probably feeling lucky as hell to have found you (since no other guy would likely tolerate even a fraction of what you have) and when she knows she's about to lose you, there may be no limits to what she says or does to keep you around.

You make a very good point here that I don't feel has been properly explored by the series (I can't speak for the book because I haven't read it yet). Amma obviously didn't kill her friends back in Wind Gap   or accomplices as we now know   and it leaves open the question about the racially charged atmosphere both in Wind Gap and in the Preaker household, where their maid was forced to wear that truly absurd and dated maid's outfit. Amma killed the girls who were labeled different and outcasts; but could this also mean that she considered them her friends because they were white? I think it's worth adding, too, that Amma, being the deceptive psychopath she so obviously is, chose to befriend an African American girl when she moved with Camille to St. Louis as a way to "keep up appearances", as we've heard people say so much throughout this series, before dispatching with her in the ways that she does. Just ugh.

Like when the President was caught on camera. Respect him by giving him the space he needs. Men are usually portrayed weak and stupid, and women as competent and with they're act together. Certainly, consistent and appropriate consequences to deter such behavior are in order. Stop repeating the same painful patterns over and over again. But it's such an astonishing attack that we had to include it. For example, the debate over deterring terrorism continues but effective solutions must apply limits and consequences that show evidence of the desired outcomes rather than emotional or politically advantageous responses to offense or outrage.

Who have known wearing a Cradle of Filth shirt with "fucked by jesus", and "fingered by god" with respective images on the front and back is a huge no no at a job interview? I never actually did that, but that my point. I enjoyed that point of my life, but I was a kid doing kid things. I had a lot of fun. I still listen to the same music from time to time, but for the most part, that part of my life is behind me.

Omaha Hi/Lo: As in Omaha Hi the player starts with 4 hole cards and similarly the player can only use 2 of them. But in Omaha Hi Lo the big difference is that you can have a high and a low winner in each hand. The player with the "high hand" wins the high (hand rankings according to Texas Hold'em) and the player with nothing "low hand" wins the low. The pot is split evenly between the High hand and low hand. In certain cases when there is no low winner the high hand takes all.
My point here is that the plastic body is not passe. And I'm not just saying that because my book, American Plastic, will be published this year.

Modernity demands that we work on ourselves, seek a better version of ourselves, and buy products to make ourselves more like the unattainable ideals that float through our cultural consciousness.

The boats is about being encased in a shell or "boats" except hands, feet and head, then being covered and (force )fed milk and honey, likely repeatedly, attracting flies. No releasing in a swamp. Flies would mate and lay eggs, eggs would turn to maggots, the victim would urinate and excrete inside this enclosed shell, (both of which are acidic and excrement is full of bacteria), then the maggots would settle in, festering in the excrement, multiplying still, eventually infesting the already rotting body through orifices and wounds inside the shell, and would eat and multiply within the still living body of the victim until it died.
