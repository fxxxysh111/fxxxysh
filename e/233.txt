I can see how a bot looking for visually similar content would flag such videos and since it has no way to tell that it not an original composition it just flags it. Not that this is right in any way but false positives are always a possibility when dealing with an AI. at least verify the flag by a human for channels over a certain size or give better support if a false positive happens.
The way the lawyer talked, only the 3 yr olds name would be on the trust fund, but since she under 18, I believe there has to be an adult name on it as well.

I think it was described as being burned and electrocuted at the same time, and far out of proportion to the animal or the amount of venom. I remember one guy said it impossible not to scream and writhe in agony just from the pain. 
I enjoyed the video and felt for him during that end rant (I want a new Valve HL game as much as the next guy), but Yahtzee explicitly stated that shovelware games like Hunt Down the Freeman somehow overpower and "drown" games like A Hat in Time on Steam, and that Valve are responsible for that.

First, he sounds like an ass. Who really makes fun of their wife for having some extra weight, with or without the fact that you just had a baby?

This is generally fine because you can use the unwanted unit to get dragonflowers, you can HM farm them to get up to 5000 feathers, and you can give their skills to another unit.

Yes it boggles my mind that more people don see this as the crisis it is, and that blame is still applied to the "whining millennials" that simply don want to pay for college.

Trained vaidyas ayurvedic doctors who practice India's 5,000 year old system of holistic medicine oversee the cleanse and reboot treatments at Elemental Embrace, a small wellness spa 90 minutes east of Toronto. The number of guests is limited to 20 to ensure a guest to staff ratio of about 1:1. Though you can get the usual facials and wraps here, most people come for the ayurvedic treatments (such as swedana, an herbalized oil massage followed by an intense steam bath, $55) and for colonics ($100). The real standout, though, is the creative, Indian inspired cooking; dessert is served first to give the body time to break down hard to digest sugars.

Curated by the San Francisco Film Society, the festival is hosted by your favorite local film venues, from the Sundance Kabuki in Japantown to the Pacific Film Archive on the UC Berkeley campus. It will be impossible to go to the movies in the next few weeks and not hear something about SFIFF. With the festival's annual inception, the landscape of the city changes.

This year's highlights include the opening night film, "Farewell My Queen," directed by Benoit Jacquot; the new thriller "Twixt" by old timer Francis Ford Coppola; a Castro Theatre presentation of Buster Keaton shorts accompanied by the live music of tUnE yArDs. Amid the headliners, the fest offers smaller narrative films and documentaries and a few experiments that integrate both (such as provocateur Harmony Korine's "The Fourth Dimension"). SFIFF will give several awards, including a directing prize for Kenneth Branagh and a tribute to the brazen Judy Davis.

Free medical school? Greater access to care? People forget that medical school is literally just the front door. No way in hell would I trust myself or any of my colleagues if they haven even completed a residency program. Let go pump out more medical students and keep the residency programs limited, cause that fix access /s. Realistically, you dumb down and saturate the quality of medical school and make residency programs EVEN MORE competitive. No way in hell free medical schools are going to increase access. Look at all the "free medical schools" out there   those are elite. You don get into those with garbage grades. Poor people aren going to realize you need to buy those $500+ question banks to churn through because medical schools don even teach you what you should be studying for your boards. Oh, your boards aren cheap either.

Everyone who was doing quotes (ten of us) had to have two quotes and he mixed us up into groups of five and told us to pick quotes and mix up what order we said them in.So I am going with the following:(a) "But the problem is that when I go around and speak on campuses, I still don't get young men standing up and saying, "How can I combine career and family?"  Gloria Steinem. I think I am going to attempt a bit of a dude voice on the last part of that quote.(b) "No woman gets an orgasm from shining the kitchen floor."

This is your opportunity to try on all the styles you never thought to try before. Be honest, look at yourself the way you look at a famous actress, your neighbor, or a complete stranger, and judge yourself with eyes that say, "That girl over there (in the mirror) has great style" or "What a ridiculous girl, wearing that!" Now, you have one new dress style? Maybe two or three? Hey, one is never enough. It is not like you have to own only one style.

(Presidents usually do the precise opposite: they struggle to avoid any appearance of disunity.) This is a breathtaking gamble, and the question arises: Is it witting or not? Is the Administration's disdain for diplomatic precedent a strategy a conscious effort to challenge the institutions and arrangements of the past 50 years or merely a matter of presidential pique? The flattery, handholding and creative fudgery that are at the heart of diplomacy are the very sort of fancy pants flummeries that the President abhors. This has been a radical experiment John McCain's Straight Talk Express taken global and the results have been dreadful.

So I'd like to possibly turn you onto to something I've been doing and get your insight. I'm sure you are familiar with EMDR. I tried it once with my therapist using bi lateral stimulation hand sensors and I loved it. So I bought my own, and I've been using them for the last 6 months during my daily meditation practice. It's hard to say exactly what's going on, so maybe you can tell me. But the analogy I like to use is if meditation is walking, then meditation with these buzzing sensors is like walking on one of those moving sidewalks at the airport. The benefits of my meditation (which are hard to quantify bc they are vast and intangible) are greatly enhanced when I use these sensors. Any clue on what's going here and why this seems so effective?? I feel like I'm onto something good here and would love to hear what you think. Thanks!!

Getting rid of headaches by applying slight force or pressure to certain pressure points is called acupressure. Acupressure is derived from the ancient Chinese healing method of acupuncture. Pressure points are clusters of nerves located at various points on the body, which help regulate blood circulation. Headaches   especially those brought on by anxiety, the common cold or menstruation   are caused by a tightness and stiffness in the neck and face muscles that inhibit blood circulation. Stimulating the pressure points by massaging them will help relax the tight muscles and increase blood circulation, thus relieving the headache [source: Scientific American].

Pronouns aren really in the Japanese language, sure there are different ways to say "I" (the closest thing we can get to a pronoun in Japan) but it not really restricted to any gender, woman can and do use boku/ore even when it usually men who use it, and men can use watashi even tho it can just be women who usually use it. (btw I think iirc I saw someone saying Rin was using Boku). There also the  chan/kun thing.  Chan is usually used for girls but it can just as easily be used for boys, vice versa for  kun (which is usually used for boys, but can easily be put on a girls name too). So basically the "Is" and "chan/kun" can give you an idea on a gender but it not 100% concrete assigned to one gender. Japan really doesn care about assigning gender pronouns. Erica scolds them for not realizing Rin was male. Vincent asks if Rin is an Otokono (which is specifically and ONLY referred to male crossdressing as female, and again "The concept of otokonoko does not directly correspond to a particular sexual identity or gender identity. Otokonoko may be of any sexual orientation."), and Rin agrees. So that three characters using male identifying language, and one of them is the character in question them self.

The pitch: Accessible, affordable massage therapy. That is the concept behind Halifax based Massage Addict, the latest venture for Lori MacKenzie, owner and president of the company.
