On the other hand, when you cremate a body, its contents also returns to nature that will ultimately nourish the ground (not that we need more CO2 nowadays). Although there are some pushes for a natural burial (which presumably is also more common in rural area), it is virtually nonexistent in urban environment where land is of premium.

That the thing though. Employees aren usually able to bend the rules of return policies because if you allowed that, Mr. I Don Give A Fuck About My Job could potentially abuse his new found power. A manager is usually a manager because they have acquired the knowledge and ability to make tough business decisions and they are held to a higher standard than the employee at the register, so if they fuck up, you better believe that manager is going to get more than a firm talking to about it. I think a lot of retail businesses don tell their employees these things and I think it would honestly help them understand these situations better if they did.

Dubbed 'Facelock', it could put an end to forgotten passwords, and protect users from prying eyes.

Eggs become transferable. Transfer any egg you don want for 1 candy of the Pokemon it would have hatched as (because the game knows egg species as soon as you receive it), with a daily limit on how many eggs can be transferred to prevent theoretically unlimited candy.

Nonetheless, numerous Republican senators have signalled that they plan to use the possibility of default as a bargaining chip, ie, that their support for an increase in the debt limit depends on whether Congress mandates additional spending cuts..

A popular belief is that the Chinese invented the game around 900 AD deriving the game from Chinese dominoes, it is reported that they played "domino cards".

Now that you understand what type of casino poker chips are actually available today, the next step is to learn how many will be needed in order to enjoy a game with your peers. If you will be playing with up to three other players, it is probably appropriate to have at least two hundred chips on hand. For games that involve a total of up to six players, having about four hundred chips is appropriate. Six hundred chips are great for games with about eight players. Larger games that integrate up to about ten players benefit from having eight hundred or more poker chips on hand!
Regular or egregious violations will result in a ban. The amount of money and good they do is substantial, but the mentality people have about it is so warped. The THON orgs are mostly just treated as a way to make friends which would be fine if they didn't also carry a religious like devotion to it.. 
I also have pretty extreme bouts of motivation upswings/downswings.

COOKED GRAINS. Not only is this a great way to save leftover rice, quinoa, farro and so on, it a smart way to meal plan. Make extra grains when you make a batch for dinner, and then freeze them in small containers or bags. When ready to use them, defrost in the fridge, or if you are adding them to a dish, you can add them still frozen.
I didn want to go into too much detail, but if this kind of thing interests you, read up about it because it all very neat tbh
For instance, if you have a foundation pile containing a six, five, and four, you can place those cards (in that sequence) on top of another foundation pile with a seven as the top card, as long as the seven and six from the separate piles are opposite colors.. 
That one possibility.. 
For fun, I also started reading about how the diaphragm contracts to expand the volume of the thoracic cavity, which decreases pressure, sucking in air through your nose and/or mouth as you inhale. Then there is some "elastic recoil" where the muscles go back to their previous shape, which decreases the volume, (increasing pressure) squeezing the air out like a deflating ballon, making you exhale. So roughly speaking, inhaling "actively" uses the diaphragm muscle and exhaling is just the same muscle springing back into the "original" shape. All of this is just to say that I think the inhale is the thing to not consciously control, because the exhale is more "automatic" anyway, and doesn require as much "letting go of".

Sofern auf der anderen Seite die hhere Bildung der Studenten einen gesellschaftlichen Vorteil bringt (Externalitten), sollte sie subventioniert werden werden sie aber auch noch nach der Einfhrung der Studiengebhren. Dieser Vorteil ist vielleicht empirisch nicht einfach "mit Geld quantifizierbar", eine gesellschaftliche Entscheidung wird aber trotzdem getroffen. Sollte der Vorteil von Philosophieabsolventen sehr gro sein, knnte man die Studenten ja auch durch staatliche Stipendien frdern (und somit mehr Leute zum Philosophiestudium anregen), das Geld und der Aufwand dafr wrde dann aber an anderer Stelle fehlen. Eine implizite Einschtzung des Geldwertes eines Philosophieabsolventen macht der Staat damit trotzdem.

One advantage of getting knocked out early, is that the failures can play in the Super Satellite at 3pm. And boy did I get lucky. I got personal when someone raised my big blind for the third time in a row. I called with 3,4 of clubs, intending to bluff the flop. The flop came, and hold on a sec, I can't possibly bet this. A,2,5. The other player bluffed again, and I called (after a small think of course). Then the poor guy turned a 7 to match his pocket pair. And we proceeded to re raise until all our chips were heaped in the middle. We turned over the cards, he fell of his chair, the river didn't pair, and I coasted into a $10,000 seat for the big one. Not a bad start at all.
Once you've decided how much to budget for the day, play at a level appropriate to your bankroll. If you have $20 for a couple of hours in the casino, you can't afford to play $1 slots or $5 blackjack. You'll need to stick to quarter slots, and at that you risk being finished for the day in about 15 minutes.

The cards that the players get are dealt in a random manner. This means that players do not have control over the cards they will be getting. So, the only control that the player has is to be in charge of how much money will be on the pot, based on the hand which the player holds..

Sidenote: he also made sure the busboys were taken care of by the servers. If they didnt tip us out at night, he would order us to ignore that server tables the next night, to let them bus their own tables for a night. If the server bitched to us about all their tables being dirty and we are standing around, we were to simply said "speak to Oben" and until they did, we were not to touch their tables. Very few servers ever repeated that mistake and if at the end of their shift or at closing they couldn find us, or we had to leave early, they would put the tip in an envelope, seal it, write both their and our names on it and place it in our time punch card slot.

Was vielleicht auch betrachtet werden sollte ist das der "weibliche Sexkauf" oft in einem seltsamen Grenzbereich zur Sexarbeit abluft. Frauen kaufen sich wohl eher "Beziehungen", treten als Sugarmommys auf (gerade im afrikanischen Sextourismus) oder gehen mit einem Gigolo Essen oder Tanzen.

To top it all off, the movie's untrained actors (friends and family of the directors) are unable to sustain their intentions for long.

The rising cost of healthcare has even previously led some public figures, like philosopher Daniel Callahan[2]and Colorado Governor Lamm,[3] to advocate healthcare rationing against older patients. In the US, healthcare costs have risen from 5% of the GDP in 1960 to 17.4% in 2013.[4] Costs have grown because of the discovery of better diagnostic tools to prevent illnesses, the treatment of hitherto untreatable diseases, and the prevention of unexpected death by CPR. These technologies improved quality of life and increased life expectancy from 47.3 years in 1900 to 78.7 years in 2010.[5]They have benefited every age group, yet it is the "elderly" alone who have been made the targets of calls for healthcare rationing in order to curb these costs.

The other guy made one last comment before he got banned from the forum. I would imagine he lying to you about a lot of things, including how profitable he is at poker. Get proactive about this now. Get on your facebook group, 2p2 marketplace, anywhere you can and name and shame him. It entirely possible that he oversold to the sat (did you really make the offer to him, or did he start saying "Oh man, the national championships are coming up and I know I crush in them, if only all my money wasn tied up with this move.") or that he doing or is planning to steal from other people. The best thing for you to do is to get him to buy you out of your equity ($900) since you can really trust that he going to pay you. It would be a bit rich for me to go to the fb group etc cos I was telling the other guy how it is none of his business what deal we do and saying that he was just jealous that he couldn play in the big game etc and my friend got that guy banned from the group, he a bit of a minor celebrity in poker circles in my town/country so I don want to rock the boat too much. I will be at the tournament to get my 10% if he does cash though for sure and I don think I will be making any more deals with him based on the feedback here. I asked him about this and he said that the other guy was just a jealous loser and reiterated the numbers so I don think I am going to get more than 10%.

A final note: in prose and poetry the Latin word "Quantum" has been mixed up with the word "Quintum" time and time again; Quintum means "a fifth" of something and has also been used as a measurement (equaling 3.65 grams) in pharmacy.

Chances are that this happened in other languages, too, but that now is the moment for a native British linguist to step in..

The surgery   done without such pleasantries as anesthesia or antibiotics, because those things didn't exist   began with a pair of assistants pretzeling the patient into the sort of pose that Clive Barker's Wishmaster would inflict upon a struggling gymnast. Then the surgeon . Um, probed the patient with his finger until he was sufficiently sure of the location and size of the stone, at which point he made an incision just above the anus and popped that sumbitch out like a champagne cork on New Year's Eve."Well I'm not going to kneel directly beneath him.

Im not certain at all but if I were to do this then the black would be highlighted up with eshin grey. I do it with an airbrush and do mostly just mixes of black and eshin grey to get it up to the final highlight. For kill team models you won need to do an airbrush, just simple edge highlights will work. The orange I use fire dragon bright. Orange is a really tough color so youd likely want to build it up from a light brown first. Probably edge highlight with an orange one shade brighter. Recess wash with nuln oil gloss for the lines in the armor panels. The gold is pretty easy with just retributor, wash with agrax, highlight with retributor then finish off with liberator.

He immediately got defensive, raised his voice and stood up in my face, ultimately shoving his finger into my chest. To this point my voice had not raised and I had not cussed.

Going forward I made sure I avoided this massage therapist. However, I took a break from getting a massage for a couple months and I cancelled my membership and just wanted to use the massages that I already paid for. I call and ask the receptionist to book me a one hour massage with any of the available therapists. When I arrive at my appointment I find out that I'm booked with the guy that grabbed my junk; and yes, he grabs my junk again. I never returned to that clinic and I still have a prepaid massage there.

This hearkens to Marshall MclLuhan statement that the medium is the message. According to his theory a new medium affects the five senses and will make one of the senses more dominant than the other four ( the ablative process). In this case we have outered a sixth sense, the central nervous system, at the expense of the visual, linear message of the printed word.
Yes, they do. You can see the resulting advertisements in the sidebar, and as sponsored posts. There's no behind the scenes nefariousness taking place, though.

A couple weeks ago I ran 18m at 8min pace with negative splits. So started slower (8:20) and slowly ramped down (my last mile was 7:20).

But I think the real lessons are far more complicated than that. People who are motivated by hate do not stop hating because one of their heroes is suddenly revealed to be less than perfectly hateful.

This is got to be one of the worst clickbaits of the year. For those who still haven read the article, it clearly say the plan will NOT ELIMINATE the disease but will aim for better prevention and control of the spread of the virus. Which is something not really that big a step that should be making a Business Insider headline. Also, the major step that needs to be taken for this "elimination" is deciding on a health budget for 2020. Now ironically, the spread of STIs and access to safe reproductive healthcare which is very deeply connected to the rise of HIV cases is a part of Planned Parenthood, a concept that Trump and his cult mob stand against.

As I mentioned in other threads last week, yesterday, 2/24 was the Hyannis Marathon. It was my first race of 2019 and my second marathon of my life. It was also the worst race that I have ever run. My damn callous got a damn blister! And it is due to the terrible weather and the my equally terrible training. Officially the temp was 40F at race start. With the rain and the wind (weather app said gusts around 20mph) the feel like temp was 29F. My training was effectively 6 weeks worth and that included only one long run. I was confident that I would finish and I did, yet it was a close thing. Around mile 14 the wind picked up and when it was a tail wind it was great, but running into it was was less than enjoyable. So my performance crashed and the last mile, well, let just say if I hadn heard the sounds coming from the finish line I might not have finished. By that point I was wondering if I needed medical attention.
