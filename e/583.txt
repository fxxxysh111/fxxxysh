I could go through your comment point by point again, but I think we both know that it won't serve either of us. My evidence won't convince you, and your deductions are things I've already seen debunked a dozen times before. I'd normally keep the debate going in order to educate anyone who might make it this far down in the thread, but nobody else is going to see it at this point. As a final note, though, I'll just encourage you to keep from repeating rumors and hearsay, because if you're genuinely interested in highlighting the real problems   the spammers, specifically   then you'll need to start by clearing away all of the misinformation and myth.
Having Gatorade or pedialyte in your room is always a good idea in addition to Tylenol/ibuprofen and snacks as well. A hat isn't a bad idea so you don't get your face absolutely cooked.. 
Be realistic in assessing whether you ready for the first week of the schedule. For example, if you been running 20 miles (32 km) per week and your longest run in the last several weeks is 6 miles (10 km), now isn the time to suddenly jump to a 33 mile (53 km) week containing a 12 mile (19 km) run and a 4 mile (6 km) tempo run, as the first week of the 18 week schedule calls for. The idea behind the schedules isn to make you as tired as possible as soon as possible but to apply repeated training stress that you absorb and benefit from.

While the aluminum case is as professional as can be, there are several other benefits to this poker chip set. It offers scratch resistant glass (which we didn't realize initially), the 11.5 gram chips with 39mm diameter, three colors, and designs that look just like they came from some casino in Vegas. Oh, and probably the most interesting part to all this is the case is made from aircraft aluminum. Oddly enough it is extremely lightweight.

Two guys in black suits (think Agents from the Matrix, security earpieces and sunglasses, the whole bit) came out of nowhere and full on tackled this guy. There chips all over the floor and this guy is full on crying, wailing, screaming "I can lose this money, I gonna be homeless, I can I can please please please." They scooped him up and dragged him out of the room. Snapped off an all in, and at showdown he grabbed his stack and just left quickly. My card room is upstairs from the main casino only accessible by elevator, which has a (poor excuse for a) security guard stationed in front of it to check IDs. Nobody stopped him, and somehow, less than six months later he was allowed back into the casino. He is now a regular again.
Think of Sandy Hook as a theatrical production   a Greek Tragedy if you like, where all the action takes place off stage. The characters on stage (the police chief, the medical examiner, the grieving father, the good samaritan neighbour, the concerned President) are real people, playing versions of themselves. They proceed to tell the audience what happened off stage (the narrative), and how they feel about it. None of it was real, and the very unconvincing performances by Wayne Carver, Gene Rosen and especially Robbie Parker are testament to that.
But it's by and large a solid film, and, compared to most comedies out there, a daring one. 
6 months for a listing is a given. 6 month holdover is a given. I agree that it a long time to be stuck with an agent and it would suck if they were bad at their job. A longer contract affords agents some protection against sellers who make it difficult to sell the property for the desired price after the agent has put time and money into marketing the property (photos, video, ads, staging, etc). Some sellers will smoke in the house, fail to keep it tidy, or decline reasonable offers to the point that the agent might lose money if it doesn sell. So if you asking for a reasonable price and can commit to pulling your weight, a shorter listing contract is a reasonable thing to ask for. If you want to sell for above market and don want to keep the place in good order for showings, an agent might be in the right to ask for more time to get it done.

TOMATO PASTE. This is one of my favourites. When a recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, don cover the rest of the can with foil and shove it into the back of the fridge. Scrape it into a freezer proof bag, press out the air and freeze. Snap off pieces as you need it; just guesstimate what a tablespoon would be, and usually you can just add it frozen to a recipe. Most recipes calling for tomato paste involve heating it, and it will melt and blend in quickly.

On the caboose of the spring train of Bay Area film festivals rides the San Francisco International Film Festival, which is the biggest of them all. Curated by the San Francisco Film Society, the festival is hosted by your favorite local film venues, from the Sundance Kabuki in Japantown to the Pacific Film Archive on the UC Berkeley campus. It will be impossible to go to the movies in the next few weeks and not hear something about SFIFF. With the festival's annual inception, the landscape of the city changes. Suddenly, it buzzes with the enthusiasm of cinephiles, filmmakers, actors and artists from all over. This year's highlights include the opening night film, "Farewell My Queen," directed by Benoit Jacquot; the new thriller "Twixt" by old timer Francis Ford Coppola; a Castro Theatre presentation of Buster Keaton shorts accompanied by the live music of tUnE yArDs. Amid the headliners, the fest offers smaller narrative films and documentaries and a few experiments that integrate both (such as provocateur Harmony Korine's "The Fourth Dimension"). SFIFF will give several awards, including a directing prize for Kenneth Branagh and a tribute to the brazen Judy Davis.

In none of the institutions you linked, historians never went over the arguments and views used by Turkish side to do a comparative analysis to at least show why they should be seen as a wrong way of looking at the events and address the most common concern of Turkish people that the genocide is recognized purely for political reasons.

But rather than a mother fearing passengers reactions, I rather we created a society where a mother might have reason to expect kindness and empathy instead.

Her ex MIL only mentioned the kids and the DV on this sub, another woman came forward as well saying she had 3 kids and not 2 and her ex came on to confirm that what she had said was true. Name calling began after Larissa called him a crossdresser and accused him of cheating on her with other men. They didn trash her as much as they could have, only basic info that can be found publicly were released. Without them, we would never known about her kids, DV arrest, etc. I still think she benefited and spun up her own sad story about her kids which her fans bought.

That "common sense" word is one Palin uttered several times during her speech. Tea Party is built upon it. Yet this is clearly not so. No one, or no one functioning very well, doubts that rain wets; but there may be some people around who question the proposition that one ought to come in out of it, holding that it is good for one character to brave the elements hatlessness is next to godliness. And the attractions of playing with fire often, with some people usually, override the full recognition of the pain that will result. Religion rests its case on revelation, science on method, ideology on moral passion; but common sense rests its on the assertion that it is not a case at all, just life in a nutshell.

Some of these quotes conflict, and that doesn mean we should discount them; it means we should take into consideration that everyone has different time horizons, goals, and risk tolerances when it comes to investing. Also, it shows that even the best investors need to maintain a sense of uncertainty when investing because even the best investment decisions can result in losses. A healthy sense of skepticism towards your investing ideas can help you spot weaknesses in your thinking, so unforeseen risk doesn blindside your investments..

Turn the heat up to medium high and sautee all this for a few more minutes until you see a sear on your veggies.Now add your toasted grain back to the pan, add water or stock, cover with a lid, and simmer on low heat or medium low heat until it gets cooked.When cooked, garnish with lots of cilantro or diced scallions or toasted chopped almonds or all of the above!Because the grain is toasted and the veggies are seared separately, the texture will be a whole lot different than a clumpy soggy mass. The grains would be separated and the dish overall would have a lot more texture and "cooked/seared" flavor.Instead of dry toasting, you could also add some oil and sautee it.While academia admittedly has many large flaws and I absolutely didn't have a fun time overall, I do think it was a really amazing learning experience and I think it achieved the goals of the program.

In order to be a full time player you have to know you can sustain a lifestyle at it. If you're uncertain you're not there yet. I was playing full time between Oct Jan for the first time in my life recently while I was in between jobs playing 100/200NL online. I averaged about 5 6k net a month which is higher than my full time job. I still decided to start my job anyway because I think it's more valuable to grind on the side, grow my bankroll, and move up stakes before going full time. I will evaluate again if I move up to 500NL 1kNL and see if that's the lifestyle I want. In your case I would grind on the side and improve until you're a winning 2/5 5/T player, have a large sample size that verifies you're a winner. (I had 250k hands before I did). You'll feel better prepared and have a higher income

As a result, my bankroll whittled down to just 5000 HKD (1 buy in) near the end of March. Gut check time. Made myself a promise that I would start playing my A game and give it my all my next session; if I went broke at that point, I'd quit poker for good and go back to school. Sat down at the Venetian at around March 31st noon, played for around 21 hours til 9am the next morning, ran pretty fucking well, and finished the session up 22K. A huge turning point for me, gave me a ton of confidence. Also probably the most stressed out I've ever been lol. Games were nice and soft, but I was a giant fish who had barely any idea what I was doing. I still managed to only lose slightly/break even while 4 tabling 25nl or 50nl for months. That how soft the games were back then.

I absolutely agree, 100%. When I was growing up my dad had a friend I called "Auntie David." Auntie David, like my dad, was gay and I knew that but I also knew that he was a drag queen and would sometimes come over wearing makeup and wigs. He bring his box of jewelry, makeup, and feather boas and we play dress up together. That was my first introduction to drag culture. It was normal for me. I a bit older than a lot of the people on Reddit so I still remember seeing RuPaul music videos in the early 90s when I was in elementary school and my dad watched The RuPaul show BUT I was only allowed to watch the introduction and then I had to go to bed. As I got older I was introduced to more drag culture through movies and television (one of the ways I knew my husband was "the one" was when I popped our VHS copy of Priscilla while we were still in high school and he wasn like "oh this is weird.") I have a two year old now and we take her to the children festitivites during pride (they do drag queen story time, "love bubbles" where they have someone come in and blow huge bubbles, that sort of thing) but I don watch Drag Race or queens youtube channels around her because it not really appropriate content for children. I think there also something to be said for people who take their children to drag events but don really do much to support LBGTQIA individuals. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth because they taking from a community for their personal entertainment/gain but not actually doing much to support that community itself buuut that a different soapbox entirely.

I asked my friend to do this when she was biking to her car on a road with no bike lane late at night. I fell asleep before getting a reply and woke up a few hours later with no response. I texted her and called her multiple times with no response. I then was checking news websites and didn't see a report about an accident. I texted her mom (at about 2 AM) asking if she was at her house. She wasn't. So I had her mom call her dad to see if she was at his house. She was.

While the first couple nights playing with the Complete Craps Set was a learning experience, most of us are well informed about the Basic Craps Rules today. Personally, my favorite is playing the pass line, doubling up on it when a 6 or 8 is rolled, and playing the 6 and 8 during rolls. For some reason those two come up like crazy when we play, so getting that extra money is a nice bonus. Unless of course, Brandon is rolling.

So deep undercover, Spider Man couldn't afford to let the gig slip, so he maintained his cover as the tiger Richard (Dick) PARKER, who Pi Patel fucked on a regular basis because he was a lonely adolescent teenage boy, only problem is: they developed a deeper relationship, so when Pi Patel says his final goodbye, Peter Parker (Spider Man) says his catchphrase "you'll always know where to find me.", and so therefore the final scene where Mary Jane says "go get 'em tiger" at the end of Spider Man 2, she is willingly giving Peter Parker permission to don the identity of Dick (Richard) Parker the Tiger for one last booty call from Pi Patel.

These aren quite the same genre as the games that you mentioned, but I do have a couple recommendations that have great story, twists, and are quite easy! Have you tried episodic games or interactive films? They aren everyone cup of tea but they might be worth trying! Beyond Two Souls was a really enjoyable game full of twists and mystery. Another extremely popular one is Life is Strange. These are both on the line of paranormal or mystery instead of sci fi, but they were still a lot of fun to go through.

Directly to your question, the games have a section in there about experienced characters, which talks about the benefits your characters gain by hitting milestones or being awesome at the table.

Don't get star struck. You'll see many of the poker stars that are regularly on TV and if you enter some bracelet events you may be pitted against some of them. Always remember, though, that you're still sitting at a standard sized poker table and playing with the same standard 52 card deck. It's like the scene in "Hoosiers" when Coach Norman Dale has his players measure the height of the hoop in Indianapolis   still the standard 10 feet. The competition may seem greater, but the game is still the same.

Spider Man's secret identity is Peter Parker; furthermore, at the end of Spider Man 2, right after Mary Jane Watson abandons her own wedding to an astronaut (who is the son of Jonah Jameson, the director of the daily bugle) to proclaim her love for the 3rd time to Peter Parker (and not get rejected this time) they kiss in the final scene of the film, where Peter Parker's spider sense tingles once again to then cue Spider Man to go and save someone in New York City. During this final scene, Mary Jane Watson says one very specific line to Peter Parker: "Go get 'em, tiger."

Poker is different from the other card games because of how it is played. The players will be given two cards. Upon receiving the cards, the players can fold. This means that the player does not wish to play the cards that he has. Once everyone has their cards already, the dealer will start laying down the flop. This is actually the term used for the first three community cards that will be shown to the players. The fourth card shown is called the "turn" while the fifth card is the "river". Afterwards, they can either raise or call.

You absolutely right, but that called whataboutism and it doesn address the argument. If anything, it just goes to show that humanity has a lot of stuff that it needs to change in order to live ethically with other animals.
