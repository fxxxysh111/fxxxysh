To these people, we must seem like spinsters, and poor ones at that since our family obviously can come up with a dowry to marry us off!

The important thing to remember is that you have every right to be a part of this gym, just as much as they do. You are allowed to use everything you are paying to use.

He does realize his love for Haidee, but there was so much more to that. He did compare her to a daughter yes, but multiple times he said he would love her in any way, and the comparison to of a daughter is more that he saved her and is her protector.

Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in depth or highly plot reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.

However if you want to get more professional chips, the ones they use in casinos, you would need to buy clay or ceramic chips.

He managed to drill the necessary hole without breaking another bit. Later in the week when we were at poker and it came my turn to deal, I pointedly did not deal a game he doesn't like. My attempt at payback failed; he lost that hand anyway.

Because of the high levels of physical activity, the lifestyles of tactical athletes include high levels of physical stress and poor diets, depending on the job and time available to eat and sleep. Lack of sleep is like a badge of honor in many military units. Sailors are especially prone to poor sleep habits with long shifts and frequently varying shift times. Staying awake for up to 72 hours is common on Navy ships. Service members will also have spent extended times traveling, with regular moves and short/long term changes of duty station. Standard army or flight helmets withvision gogglesweigh between4 and6 pounds. Individuals with extended daily exposure to heavy head gear are at increased risk for neck pain, muscle fatigue, and headaches. Moreover, when head gear weight is combined with vibration and shock movements in vehicles and aircrafts, it increases the risk for cervical spine injuries. The average load for soldiers and marines in Iraq and Afghanistan is between 60 120 pounds. Years of running on hard surfaces, expended periods wearing heavy boots, and being in confined spaces, falls from military vehicles, or accidents and exposure to improvised explosive devices (IED) can also cause pain and cause or contribute to injury.

I don think verbosity is such a holy test though. One might argue that using names like string_compare instead of strcmp adds to the readability rather than taking away from it and also note that C hilariously short names for many of its core functions date from the time that C identifiers could be no longer than 6 characters; as in they could be longer but the compiler would just throw the rest away which is so possible even worse than just throwing a parse error..

Even with complete knowledge of how everyone wants to vote, it is very hard to co ordinate such a campaign to shift votes in such a complicated way. But it should be difficult to tactically vote to get rid of someone you don't like against the wishes of a substantial minority of people.

Most importantly, know that the decision to continue on with your wedding is one you got a little bit of time to make, so don worry about it just yet. We ended up deciding to keep our date, because it left me in fear that something similar would happen and the hospitals here only let spouses and family stay with you in an emergency. 
What helped me was setting myself a period to try it out. I used fasting before Easter (without being religious, it was just convenient timing). It was hard, especially like week three or so, and afterwards I initially wanted to go back to eating meat. Did it three, four times and realised that I did not really need it, so I stopped ever since. To be honest, i wasn much of a vegetable eater before, this really transformed me and opened up more "new" dishes than it prevents me from eating. Before I always went for some kind of burger with fries, now I try many different things and it has been a real enrichment.

Also, they don't do this. There is a lot of intuition and guesswork because you have imperfect information. Just as an example   there are a lot of people who really like betting big if there is a pair on the board   which is a classic bluff   people will think you have three of a kind and fold. If you've played this guy a bunch, then you know that and you will be more likely to call with two pair than you would against an unknown player. But then again, he also knows that you've played him a bunch and will call him on it, and so he might have been playing cautiously which makes it more likely that he wouldn't be bluffing you, and so on.

In 2016, Kavanaugh reported credit card and personal loan debts of between $60,000 and $200,000. Kavanaugh explained that the dollar amount of the debt "was not close to the top of the ranges listed on the 13 financial disclosure reports." He added that much of the debt was spent on a series of home improvements and on season tickets to the Washington Nationals baseball team, an expenditure thatattracted attention from the media. They would divide the tickets at a"ticket draft" at his house. "Everyone in the group paid me for their tickets based on the cost of the tickets, to the dollar," he wrote. "No one overpaid or underpaid me for tickets. No loans were given in either direction."

Went back the next week and decided to take advantage of the priests hearing confession before mass. Now if you don know the Catholic ritual for confession, you basically start by saying "Bless me Father for I have sinned, it has been (X amount for time) since my last confession." Now even when I was still a regular at age 14, I hadn went to confession in a long time. So when it came to that bit I just said "many years" since my last confession. 
Throughout this thread I have provided multiple references, studies, and widespread proof that economic injustice is at the root of the problem of racism and solving it is a key step in removing racism. This is a view supported by the leaders of civil rights movements and minority and black rights movements, both past and present. You have completely dismissed all of that and it clear there is no point in discussing it any longer.

Any discussion of muscle building foods requires a spotlight on meat. Sure, all ten foods could be derived from animals (beef, buffalo, bison, elk, venison, lamb, ostrich, turkey, fish, and eggs) but that would be boring and unpractical for many of you who aren't avid wild game hunters. Still, there is abundant evidence that meat provides a better quality protein for the body to use for muscle building and optimal anabolic hormone function..

I don know what there is in this engraving that speaks "color" to me when it should probably be just concerning itself with the blackness of its deep black (which for me is usually the case). Neither the blackness nor the dimensionality of the thing it seems to give itself some height and depth at the same time say anything louder than the representation of its missing colors, which we are clearly seeing nothing of in these wavelengths except that there really aren any colors here outside of the beautiful black white. contrast is certainly there ("There are dark shadows on the earth, but its lights are stronger in the contrast." Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers), especially in the corner bits, where on closer inspection the blackness is really more white than black. In any event, the print suggests "color" to me for no good reason, except perhaps that it looks very cold, and cold is suggestive of ice blue, and the good contrast for that is yellow. "The sound of colors is so definite that it would be hard to find anyone who would express bright yellow with base notes, or dark lake with the treble." so wrote Mr. Kandinsky, who saw colors in his sound, and who in the midst of things wrote four experimental pieces of theater based upon this observation, the first and perhaps most prominent of which was called "Yellow" (1909). that is why this old engraving seems "yellow" to me (and this without any benefit of synesthesia).

In Swat, Dir and parts of Buner our army has suffered heavy casualties. If the US military had suffered a quarter of these casualties in the two months or so since the Swat operation started, there would have been a storm in Washington. But since it is Pakistan's 'peasant' army suffering these losses it is a different matter altogether. Washington, however, is not to blame. If we remain chumps when it comes to bargaining with the US, the fault is not in our stars but us. Other countries will not put a proper value on us or what we do unless we first put a proper value on ourselves.

Cheers to the female players.

Professionals also take notice of what other people are doing. If most people are tight (often said as "the table is tight") it is better to be looser and vice versa.

"A horse apiece" means, as you supposed, "more or less equal" or "six of one, half dozen of the other." Field researchers for The Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) first heard "a horse apiece" in 1980, but the phrase is undoubtedly much older. A similar phrase, "horse and horse," dates back to at least 1846.

There are plenty ofunique design features of the B787 Dreamliner, although it is difficult to show them in pictures. However, one of the biggest design facets of the 787 is the upward curved wingspan, which reduces drag and gives a smoother ride. Also built in to the design of the 787 is a unique filtration system that is said to eliminate (or at least reduce) bacteria and odour in the cabin air, which is a godsend if you sitting next to a smelly passenger! The windows on the 787 are also around 30% larger than on other aircraft, and these windows have LED shades that can replicate the sunrise and sunset. These are found all over the aircraft, including in the economy cabins, and are said to reduce jetlag for all customers. Another important feature of the B787 Dreamliner is that the cabin pressure is different to other aircraft in the sky. On the 787, the cabin is pressured to 6000ft, which is 2000ft lower than normal, and this helps the body absorb over 8% more oxygen. So, it is clear that most of the unique design features of the B787 Dreamliner are intended to give its passengers a much smoother and more comfortable flight, and this is why so many airlines are purchasing it for their fleet.

By explaining heat in terms of the statistical behavior of atoms and molecules, statistical mechanics made sense of thermodynamics and also provided strong evidence for the reality of atoms. Besides that, statistical mechanics established the role of probabilistic math in the physical sciences. Modern extensions of statistical mechanics (sometimes now called statistical physics) have been applied to everything from materials science and magnets to traffic jams and voting behavior. And even game theory.

But they very specific about space requirements per animal etc   the eggs I buy now are all pasture raised.

This is why I have a hard time reading Alexander Hamilton's writing compared to that of his contemporaries. He doesn't just use big words, he constructs sentences in such a flowery, round about way that I can understand why people thought he came from another planet. Compared to the writings of John Adams, who was just as educated as Hamilton, but who wrote in such a clear and relatable way that a child could read them today and know exactly what he meant, whereas anything written by Hamilton requires going through line by line with footnotes and a teacher explaining what every twist of phrase meant, like when you read Shakespeare in 9th grade..

I work with lots of cables in my job. Although this is an awesome solution now, the stress of the cable pulling in the wrong direction is going to cause damage over prolonged use.

Generally you speak in your conversation in the language that you think the most people will understand. If you have trouble, you switch for a phrase and then try to explain it or ask for help explaining it. Sometimes big groups fracture, and in that instance it ok to speak in the most common language there, but if someone joins, you may want to switch back when you would normally say "we were just talking about X." What you should not do under any circumstance is proceed to speak in a language that someone does not understand (unless you share no languages) because that is just telling them that they are not welcome in the conversation.
