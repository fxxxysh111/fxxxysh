My dad used to be a bus driver/ concrete truck driver and he said there are three trucks to look out for on the road. Number one the trucks that carry gravel. They are usually paid by the load and are driving as fast as they can as get more loads in. They usually don't have the load covered and they don't care if the rocks break your windshield. Number 2 were these kind of trucks, the guys driving are usually construction workers who just want to go home, boss sent them to the dump and they threw it all in the back haphazardly and usually don't have the class c license to drive a larger truck. Number 3 was a concrete truck that's full. They are in a hurry to get the load out before it goes bad, they are usually better drivers but they will go to extreme measures to make it to their destination in time because if they don't it's a huge fuck up for the day.

You can sell your own sex work.

The most common complication of Crohn's disease, obstruction may arise from swelling and the formation of scar tissue. The result is thickening of the bowel wall and a narrowed intestinal passage. These narrowed areas are called strictures. Strictures may be mild or severe, depending on how much they obstruct the passage of the bowel's contents. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction include crampy abdominal pain, frequently associated with vomiting, and bloating. Medications may relieve the obstruction by reducing the local area of inflammation. If the obstruction is severe and does not respond to medical treatment, surgery may be required. Surgery also may be indicated if the blockage recurs frequently.

Cluster   Cluster headaches are headaches that occur repeatedly over a period of weeks or even months. Cluster headache pain usually occurs on one side of the head and is centered around the eye. The causes of cluster headaches are unknown, but may be related to changes in blood flow because substances that affect blood flow, such as alcohol, can trigger cluster headaches. Primary headaches can also be caused by too much blood flow. For example, if you have read How Caffeine Works, you know that caffeine reduces blood flow in the brain. Some pain relievers contain caffeine to take advantage of this effect. If you have been taking caffeine every day and you stop, you can get an incredible headache because of the increased blood flow in your brain. Secondary headaches result from some other problem with your body. For example, How Viruses Work talks about why you get a headache (and other pains) when you have the flu. Once you eliminate the disease, you eliminate the secondary headaches. Most headache pain can be treated with over the counter medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Motrin) and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. As mentioned above, migraines have been helped by drugs that block serotonin, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex). Cluster headaches have been treated with sumatriptan, steroids (Migranal) and narcotics. your welcome;);) (Full Answer)

 1 point  submitted 12 hours agoI played 150+ games on Pathfinder right now. You have some sick outplay potential and you generally good because you insanely mobile. There just 2 caveats: (1) you can cancel your hook mid hook. (2) When you hook a player target, it mostly pathfinder moving towards the target, without being able to shoot whilst hooking.Even if they keep the hitbox the same, I think those two would make Pathfinder among the best characters in terms of level meta.And I noticed that is a difference in range THAT significant? For example 200 FT vs 300 FT, most people I know can clear 100 FT in under 10 seconds when running and close engagement distances, negating range and relying on who has better accuracy or is the better player overall.Short question, I heard different stances on the Rhop, some people have said it barely improves effective range, only improving accuracy while others say RHops increased their range by 50ft. Just need some clarification.Sorry no tech question, but just a discussion question that I felt would relate to teching at least a bit, and didn feel significant enough to justify a post. Thanks for understanding.

If someone appeared on a charge of communicating for the purpose of obtaining sexual services, then the agency would ask to view the information documents on the case.Those documents, which are available to the public on request, include basic information such as an accused offender full name, birth date, home address, the date they were charged, any release conditions, the date of their next court appearance and other details.you can access that information unless you have the (accused) offenders name, so it was kind of a Catch 22 for us, Walker said.The agency discovered the names of several men charged in Project Circuit, including a London lawyer who was charged both with providing police with a false identity and with communicating for the purpose of obtaining sexual services stemming from an alleged incident on Nov.

"Data from the airplane's flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the airplane's right elevator was positioned full trailing edge down (TED) when the flight crew first powered up the airplane on the day of the accident and remained there throughout the accident sequence. An airplane performance study (based, in part, on FDR data) confirmed that the airplane did not respond in pitch when the captain pulled on the control column. Based on the study's comparison with a previous takeoff, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the airplane's lack of rotational response to the control column input did not become apparent to the captain in time for him to have stopped the airplane on the runway.

To understand why greenhouse gases are harder to fix, and you need at least double the yearly energy expenditure to go neutral, understand that 80% of the world energy comes from fossil fuels. Produces 50 pounds of CO2 for every one pound of trash generated. CO2 is a heavy molecule with extra oxygen atoms for every carbon in the original carbon chain and it is relatively diffuse, so it is hard to capture and move. 
However, the other two works illustrated Sokolow darker, more dramatic side, and the company danced them with commitment and polish. The 1952 Suite and the signature (1961) showed the choreographer leanings toward stark, post modern severity, painting with broad strokes instead of flashy steps, favoring silence and stillness, refusing to follow melodic line or rhythmic pulse. As Sokolow admitted in one of the video clips, only way to be popular is to be nice, harmless. . . . That doesn interest me. What the viewer takes away isn movement invention as much as powerful context and imagery that sears itself into the brain. Suite, danced to Alban Berg eponymous quartet, has an austere elegance and formality. Whitney Hoke danced with fierce abandon, matching the pizzicatos and tremolos in the music with quivering hands and skitters across the floor. With arms outstretched, face raised to the ceiling or ducked abjectly, McKinney was a soul searching supplicant.

I think his game here was to give the agents what they wanted   more information to deal with future Chris Wattes and the chance to do something else other than stare at the cell walls. Agents were stellar and developed a good rapport with Chris so they could get him to divulge more. Prison is boring AF  getting to spend the day not inside your cell is a rarity, he probably hasn talked to anyone about this in this amount of detail since he has been locked up and like one of the agents said it was most likely therapeutic for him and lastly if he is in the good graces of the FBI, it will be easier for him to transfer prisons in the future (for example asking to be moved to one closer to NC in the future to be near his parents)..

It is better to have it swing outwards. First of all it as you say harder to kick in (or push in) and secondly it better in a case of fire (see edit). Of course hinges are a weak spot but if you having a "safety door" usually you have metal rods that goes into the wall on the same side as the hinges when the door is closed, so if the door is locked and closed I believe it will stay closed regardless if the hinges are there or not. Also the hinges themselves are not exactly easy to work with, they are very slim and you need to go at them for quite some time to loosen them. You also have to consider that most burglaries (at least here in Sweden) is not committed by going through the door, but rather somewhere else.

The positive effects of physical activity extend to fine cell morphology. In particular, exercise affects the properties of dendritic spines, which are actin rich protusions on the dendrites that contain excitatory synapses. Changes in spine size and quantity are associated with LTP induction and are considered to support changes in synaptic strength.

Acute pain is caused by an injury to the body. It warns of potential damage that requires action by the brain, and it can develop slowly or quickly. Tumors invade healthy tissues and exert pressure on nerves or blood vessels, producing pain. Cancer pain can also be associated with invasive procedures or treatments. Some physicians classify cancer pain with chronic pain. You might think this sounds likea good thing, but it's actually a life threatening condition. Pain serves as a warning against injury, sopeople whodon't feel itcan be severly injuredhurt by things that most of us would react quickly to. For example, Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall describe a girl who got third degree burns on her knees by climbing ona hot radiator. There was no signal for her to stop. Researchers are trying to reproduce this condition by genetically altering mice so that they can study the genetic contributions to pain perception.

1   sometimes when I mourturize my face or back/arm/chest skin (less so with legs and almost never on myfeet) either for a long time, like I just continue rubbing it in, or when I layer two moisturizers like on my face, I find that the moisturizer starts forming these little balls and basically comes back off my skin. What the deal with this? It also started happening when I apply liquid foundation over moisturizer (which is a trick someone taught me a long time ago to get smooth looking skin). Now I have to have completely bare skin for foundation, otherwise it makes the little balls which in turn makes the foundation look terrible..
