The type of coffee you drink can heighten its effect on your breath. For example, an espresso containing a concentrated dose of 75 milligrams of caffeine per ounce will give you hard core coffee breath, not only because of its caffeinated qualities but because its intense flavor will linger. In fact, most bad breath follows a general rule of thumb: The more potent the smell of the liquid or food that is ingested, the more potent its effect on your breath. It's the same reason why eating onions or garlic will lend your breath an unsavory smell for hours on end [sources: Mayo Clinic, Live Science].

What are his check raise bluffs? I think he could have a lot here. That flop hits his range much harder than yours. Depending on villain style of play he could have suited 9x w/ Backdoor Flush trying to fold out any two overs while still having a lot of good turns to barrel. Or, a 5 with a pair or backdoor flush draw. When he check raises to that sizing he probably does not have a very merged range. So, by firing a pot sized bet on the turn he is representing the nuts and some percentage of sets. Why would he be trying to barrel money in the middle on the turn with only the nuts in his value range? I mean the sizing is pretty sick because if you call the turn the SPR on the river is so low you are calling with anything, which means you are folding the turn a higher %, BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT YOU TO FOLD THERE WITH THE NUTS????

If we are to tell a story about the origin of commercial gambling, the history of poker would go side by side, as the two cannot be separated. Dated back to early 19th century, poker is probably a card game with the highest number of variants, the most popular and widely spread being Texas Hold'em. Originating in Texas, Hold'em poker did not cross the state border until the late 60s, when three Texan gamblers brought the game to the Mecca of USA gambling   Las Vegas. At first, the game did not really kick off and for quite a while it was only offered in the famous Downtown Las Vegas casino, Golden Nugget. The reputation of the casino back then did not help with promoting Texas Hold'em to high rolling players and it was not until the game was played at the Dunes casino that Hold'em started to attract high end players.

Yeah, I be "that guy". This guy was a suspect in the abduction, hadn even gone to trial yet (was being brought to trial at the time of his murder), and there were merely "reports" (read: media rumors) that the child had been sexually molested. What this guy did was cold blooded murder. It wasn some crime of passion where he saw the accused suspect and flew into a violent rage. He planned it out. He was waiting at the airport for the exact moment that the suspect was being brought through so he could ambush him from behind and put a bullet in his head. This was premeditated and he most definitely should gone to prison for murdering an innocent man (remember, you innocent until proven guilty, and this man hadn been proven guilty of anything).

For starters, coffee can cause xerostomia, more commonly known as "dry mouth." That's because coffee contains caffeine   up to 200 milligrams in a single 8 ounce or 237 milliliter cup   one of the chief culprits of decreased saliva and, in turn, a dry mouth.

Maybe it was books carried by people who were professional travelers or at least traveled a lot, like Napoleon or Alexander going to "work". What about professional books? I doubt that copies of Newton, Galileo, Copernicus, and so on have traveled very much on their own (though the ideas contained in them are probably among the best traveled of that sort), but I suspect that anatomies (Vesalius, Gray) have some miles in them. There are no doubt other reference books like that that could have traveled save for their size (like Audubon, which could have been useful in the field but which would have needed their own caravan).

Where Democrats really standSenate Democratic leadership hasn't whipped the short term funding bill vote yet   and likely won't until it's clear House Republicans have the votes to pass the measure.

For example, the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate heart rate; widen bronchial passages; decrease motility (movement) of the large intestine; constrict blood vessels; increase peristalsis in the esophagus; cause pupil dilation, piloerection (goose bumps) and perspiration (sweating); and raise blood pressure. Afferent messages carry sensations such as heat, cold, or pain.The first synapse (in the sympathetic chain) is mediated by nicotinic receptors physiologically activated by acetylcholine, and the target synapse is mediated by adrenergic receptors physiologically activated by either noradrenaline (norepinephrine) or adrenaline (epinephrine).

Fortunately, these poker bots may not be a threat for long. But you might think, why should these poker rooms care, since poker bots make as much money for them as real people do?

I have yet to see a study that shows small amounts of a vitamin or mineral naturally present in a food concentrate are better than normal supplements when one is therapeutically addressing a specific condition. And if pharmacological amounts of a nutrient are required, a handful of food concentrate pills is needed.

The scope of a theory is the limits of where it is applicable. 'The Theory of Unsupported Falling' started out with the universe as scope. Testing it with something lighter than air or in a spaceship disproved the old theory and replaced it with one with a narrower scope, the falling objects had to be heavier than air, and the location had to be Earth.. 
Very affordable, and I would encourage anyone who has those ugly UFO dishes in their condo to just pull them down, and replace it with this Ikea fixture. It only $40.

Without suggesting racial discrimination, the choice of color of clothes must also be in step with the naturally blessed complexion. In contrast, if the charisma of the personality is so over whelming, any color would suit them.. 
In the south the largest at risk group is heterosexual african americans. If you surveyed most impoverished african americans in the south you would find many who think HIV is not something heterosexual men get. There was a lot more PSAs trying to break this myth during the 90s but they are rare today. These are conservative states where sex education is much less than liberal states. They are not getting this education in school, they are not getting it from media, they are less likely to regularly go to the doctor so they arent getting this information from their doctor

On my pct thru I was ready for new shoes after about 600 miles for the first pair (NB Leadvilles), My second pair lasted about 850 (slightly more stubborn and cheap), and I rode out my last pair closer to 1100 miles. I think I got used to the idea that my feet were never going to be comfortable no matter what and combined that with pinching pennies at the end of a thru.

By decreasing the length of the string by placing a finger on it, the pitch becomes higher. 
It like an Uber ride; the meter just keeps getting reset to 0 after every fight and you want to keep coming back for more KOs. It's like an addiction, you want the urge (of seeing the KO) satisfied over and over and over but the longer you don't get it fulfilled the more restless you become. 
I am not originally from the Dayton area but from Southern CA. I saw all sorts of 80 hit movies at the mall. It was like the "teen thing" to do in the mid 1980s in SoCal   go hang at the mall for the day. But I understand what you mean when hanging at the mall brings back memories.

Maybe you wouldnt either? (but keep the pad). 
I can't really afford a new laptop. 
I realize there are books and web sites on this, and I've even looked at the old AskMe threads. I'm basically just looking for some solid rules of thumb that a novice like me can carry around in his head so that he has a decent chance of success. (My googling yielded "novices shouldn't bluff" and "very few hands are playable", which have stood me in good stead for our first few games, but I'm ready for a few other pointers.). 
Think that something from the tribe perspective that still needs to be reviewed, Allen said of the Senate bill. Concern, separate from the compact, is that outside influences coming into the state of Florida, non regulated, is something that we don believe is good for the industry in general. I think that that language is something that we have to work through with the state.

It's not Flint, Michigan or Puerto Rico or some place that rich politicians don't need to care about.This is basically New York. If Manhattan Island became sieged like this, the whole country would panic like it was 9/11, and rightly so. 
When I had 32 students in one classroom, I was creating my own activities since I not provide a curriculum/resources, and have one planning period, how the hell can I this actionable feedback that will actually result in student improvement? How am I supposed to give individualized attention without neglecting the other 20 students that period?

When he was outside he was then sucker punched from the back by another bouncer, during which my client slapped the African American bouncers face with an open handed slap for the violations.

Nonetheless my client was extremely disrespected resulting in the slap to the face of the African American bouncer, who started the confrontation in the first place.

When I was looking at getting started with real money poker he/they (whatever) helped me get started. Even gave me $10 free to sign up with ACR. 
This is a 100% clear angle bro and way not cool. Big chips always go in front never obscured. To answer your question, wizards are always relying on Villian's exact stack counts and current financial status on bluffs too. 
The flop comes with 2 10s its very hard to put him on a ten. I would say he has one 10 15% of the time and that might even be on the high side.

Now I get to decide if I want to go back to the Cetaphil, which at the very least doesn cause me to break out, or if I want to keep on experimenting and potentially develop a larger inventory of subpar cleansers.  Of course, I going to wait until my skin calms down (hopefully a day or two, the acne is sudden but minor) by dealing with the acne with my persa gel and just doing a water rinse..

I don't want any second hand goods, believe ME. As for Horace Baxter, he was in financial difficulties a year ago last summer, and he prayed to the Lord for help; and when his wife died and he got her life insurance he said he believed it was the answer to his prayer. Wasn't that like a man?". 
As the dust started to clear and settle, it turned out that a lot of online players planned to move to Toronto or Vancouver to continue their online poker careers.

Brendan says they put her in the car and drove the car to a quarry pond, planning to throw her in the pond, but the ponds were too shallow and they decided against it.
