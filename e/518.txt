And here comes what bugs me most about all of this, it absolutly ridiculous to justify it all by saying "it a game about pirates", likewise the comment "it sea of thieves, not sea of friends".

The only part of this response that I don't buy at all is that the right is "calm." If you've talked to a Trump supporter, you'd know how fucking batshit crazy they are because they are completely divorced from reality. Liberals yelling about how the Trump Admin should not abuse children/babies, shaming the President for encouraging violence toward the press, colluding with a foreign enemy (along with other member of the GOP, several of whom spent the 4th of July in motherfucking Russia) is not the same as people on the right screaming about how Obama is a secret Muslim from Africa, and Hillary and the Deep State are conspiring to attack Trump, and Hillary is also running a pedophile ring out of the non existent basement of a fucking pizza restaurant. The difference is one side is making arguments from real events and the other is in the safe space of their imaginations where all sorts of mental gymnastics can confirm their beliefs..

This broadside was an appeal to like minded people to contribute to a fund to help relieve thew dire conditions of textile worker strikers in Passaic, New Jersey, in 1926. There were more than 16,000 people involved in this sometimes brutal strike, people who were trying to stay even in their lives, looking for a little more money and a little better working conditions than what they had. The Passiac (a working city just south of Patterson in an industrial triangle section of the state) strikers were moving against a number of textile (wool and silk) mills there, trying to force management to pay them something closer to the $1400 annual income for a family of four to survive.

Look at the chip pattern for clues. One reason why it's a good idea to practice with different colored chips is that it makes it easier to tell when something is going wrong with your shuffle. When done properly, your shuffled chips should alternate between the two colors. If you see two or more of the same color next to each other in the stack, you should reevaluate your technique. If there is a general lack of interlacing, you can try working on couple aspects of your shuffle:
American children are taught to fear all adult sexuality as predatory, even when it has nothing to do with them. But how exactly would children be harmed by peeping in a man window and seeing him set the coffee to "brew" while he scratched his underwear free private parts? Perhaps the children would be appropriately grossed out and learn not to look into peoples windows? And perhaps they would realize that not all naked men are a sexual threat?. 
With the issues of property and support behind them, the couple still had one more fight to fight: who would pay the legal costs? Justice Conlan directed the parties to file written submissions on the issue of costs. The determination of the issue was, unfortunately, consistent with the wife uncooperative behaviour, which Conlan described as trying patience of the Judge to a degree that is beyond description. The wife disregarded Justice Conlan direction regarding costs, filing submissions that were both too long and late (the judge nevertheless considered them).

Lap 3. Oooooo things started to be a bit of a grind. I passed by the mystery bearded man again. Ok that has to be Cody Reed. Super cool that I'm racing a Coconino Cowboy, but I knew he was hunting me! I needed to push if I wanted to stay in front of him and show that I can run with the best. But I could feel the gap was closing. I was slowing down. I kept up the gels and hydration and continued trying to stay cool. On the climbs my groin was super tight and painful though. Not pleasant at all! Regardless, I kept fighting. At this point I was just hoping to have enough of a lead to hold him off. About 500m 1km from the last aid station, I took a look back. Bright orange shorts, there's Cody. He's pushing. I figured it was a matter of time before he got to me, and then I'd have to see if I could hang on.

Again, if "not paying taxes" is your complaint we should work on making it easier for them to pay taxes legally.

A possibility to win back the casino bonus in this case is a bit less than 50% (for that you only need to stake the entire amount on the chances in roulette). In order to maximize profits from "sticky" casino bonuses a casino player needs to use the strategy "play an all or nothing game".

Skiing is the perfect sport for the solo traveler, what with wide open pistes and spectacular mountain scenery offering constant companionship, and the ability join the "single's line" for quicker chairlift access.

Now, he innocently asks the honourable judges what he did wrong.

Shipowitz said the company has local legal counsel prepared to argue there's no probable cause to believe any gambling, as the statute defines it, in this operation.

I worked as a host for Red Lobster in college and got accused of being racist multiple times for seating people in the back of the restaurant. The reality was that our servers each had assigned tables they took care of and as a host my job was to stagger the seating so that the servers had more or less equal numbers of tables.

You'll make $5 and hour in daytime, which is 40$ to pay for your drinks at night, but you are beating the micro tables online, so you sure as hell can beat the $1/$2 live game and now you have a good shot to try and make yourself 100BB a night (200$). You aren't currently a winning player at 2NL. The gap to achieve this is going to take you hundreds (if you are exceptionally talented/have perfect study habits) of hours and more likely thousands of hours. If you put that effort into many other endeavors it's likely you'll make far more than your desired 24k/year.

So dark matter has to have a small charge to mass ratio in order to agree with observational data. The easy way to do this is to have zero electric charge, but in principle a really small electric charge is allowed by experimental data. This is so called millicharged dark matter. I don know of any motivation for millicharged dark matter models, but that may just be my ignorance of those models. It worth mentioning though, besides electric charge, there also electric and magnetic dipole moments which are in principle allowed but also constrained (I don have any numbers on hand for these constraints). But you can get dipole moments easily for electrically neutral composite particles when the constituents are charged.

You may like the idea of using herbal remedies because they are natural, but like any other medication, medicinal herbs are dangerous if they're not used properly. They should be given only with veterinary supervision and in consultation with someone trained in the use of herbs.

Before treating your dog with any herbal preparation, check with a qualified holistic veterinarian.

Another time, I found myself making a big raise with pocket sixes when I was one off the button, and then calling when the 70,000 man, now in the small blind, moved all in with A 10. It was torture when an ace came on the river and I lost the hand. 
I also act on my moral convictions. I have previously mentioned that my field of study is anthropology while my field of work is sports related.

While I try to do my best in helping others in real life I think it also important to try and help the world as best I can. I recognize that my summaries aren going to reach everyone, but I feel it my duty to at least try to do something positive.

Ranked choice voting to determine a statewide winner would be a step back into the direction of FPTP here.

Susan Kaye, a therapist working in Philadelphia and Austin, Texas, works with surrogates "below the horizon" for a practical reason   she can't even find certified surrogates in her areas. "I have gotten around it by working with people who are 'body workers,' people I have trained on what I want them to do with clients." "Body work," as Kaye defines it, excludes intercourse, but can include genital touching and genital massage. While patients with a regular sex partner can do therapy "homework," single men and women, who, after all, might be single because they need sex therapy, don't have study buddies. Even a partnered man or woman trying to work out a fetish, or someone who has been raped or assaulted and can't stand being touched could use a surrogate.

There's considerable controversy among triathletes and coaches about exactly what the balance should be between high and low intensity training, especially when it comes to running. Proponents of low intensity workouts contend that running as many miles as possible at a slower pace is most beneficial, while those who support high intensity exercise feel that it's better to run fewer miles at a faster pace. There are valid arguments to support both points of view. High intensity workouts help train your body to pick up the pace when passing someone on the bike or jockeying for position at the end of the run. Low intensity workouts aren't as physically demanding, so they allow an athlete to train for longer periods of time, thus generating greater overall aerobic fitness. An ideal triathlon workout program contains both types of training, with the majority being low intensity.
Topical treatments improve the look of skin with specific ingredients, such as retinoids (which make skin stronger), lactic acids (which remove dead skin cells) and caffeine (which will be discussed on the next page).

This is not about profits to shareholders, this is about the ability to pay doctors for their work. If a hospital isn making enough money because the government can or won pay them what they are worth, they why would they continue in that field? The only way to control the cost at that point is through rationing or by not paying doctors such a high salary. In that case, you going to get less skilled doctors entering the medical field when they can make more in a different field..

He comes off as honest and sincere, very in tune with his approval rating, and staunchly committed to an ever expanding socialist form of government regardless of mixed/disappointing results thus far.

Sometimes fragrance simply tagged along in the footsteps of the famous. For example, Alexander the Great's conquests had little to do with the pursuit of fragrant materials.

I really think that these people are simply led astray by attitude problems in the academic community, which could certainly be addressed. I would go so far as saying that it must be addressed, or else we find it hard to maintain a practical command of the knowledge we acquired so far, given that nobody wants to deal with the assholes who could teach them. There a reason we all agree that education is extremely important, and you can forget that every generation is born with 0 knowledge about anything, and we have to continually re teach all of this stuff to people or it be effectively gone until someone works their way back up to it autonomously.
