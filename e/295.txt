But, I going to say something that is increasingly unpopular in both academic and activist circles: advertising is controlling our minds and our bodies and it controls them so it can sell us more stuff. That how consumer capitalism works. We see these ideal types, these icons of beauty and desire, and we want to be them. We look in the mirror. We are clearly not at all like these ideal types. We feel bad about: our wrinkles, our cellulite, our small breasts, everything about ourselves. We remember that the ads said if we just bought this toothpaste/car/pair of shoes/mascara, then we would be more like the images floating in the space of ads.

True, that consensus is modest. About the only thing MPs agree on is the need to avoid a chaotic, no deal Brexit.

The movement needs to identify a problem which they would like to solve with legestation, or at least start a bigger international discussion about how people should treat people. I think that the movement is very good with the latter when it comes to discussions about consent which is a much needed talk around the world. But on issues that might actually divide feminists there has been less discussion because the division reduce the movements power.

Whole thing is meant to be a joke, indicating emphasis on simple concepts with a gesticulation that became somewhat popular from "unintelligent" reality TV characters who did it for everything. If people are being annoying about their political beliefs, that a combination of them being annoying about politics, ignorance, and a gross misuse of the joke. It like when everyone was making "not" jokes after borat. It fine when used correctly, but people who don know what they are doing starting abusing it and it became excruciatingly annoying. That more to do with the people and not the joke. Besides, the people most likely to say inflammatory political statements with no apparent consideration for opposing views are going to say that regardless of the clap emoji. It changes nothing about how stupid their statement is.

It insanely stupid that you seem to think that Americans are owed a successful company no matter how bad they are at running it but American workers have to prove themselves or else they deserve to make no money because someone will do it for cheaper. Following your brilliant logic, every small family owned construction company can fuck off and die since larger ones will do it for cheaper, right? Either the bottom line is all that matters or it not, you don get to have it both ways.

But even though noticeably large muscles wouldn be any more realistic, women are weaker to the extent that they are smaller. Just like men are. You mention tennis? Men thrash women at tennis. Amateur male soccer teams thrash professional female soccer teams. They can kick the ball farther and run faster, so it not even a matter of skill. A female warrior who could realistically compete with men would be an extreme outlier by our modern culture standards, like Brienne in Game of Thrones. I like her.

And with you dropping the rope, I sure facetime with the thief will die sooner rather than later. So everybody wins! (Well, everybody but the thief. )

In all cases, however, the practitioner chooses the treatment modality he or she believes will be most effective in view of the practitioner's experience and the individual receiving treatment.

So I definitely think I butchered this hand. Looking back, his pre flop play left him uncapped, so there's no reason for me to not fear AK, AQ, or AA on this board. In fact, his lead on the turn probably discounts hands like JJ/TT, as the A didn't scare him off of those. On the river, I think my only logic was basically that combinatorially there were blockers for all of these full house+ hands (the board plus my KQ), but looking back I recognize that those hands just make the most sense given his pre flop play, and I should have respected his range advantage. And while I could hope he made a flush on the turn, there aren't actually many flush hands he could have here either. I need to be more disciplined about looking at the situation (what hands would he play this way) rather than focusing on how few hands in total have me beat.

With an Erick Lindgren Poker Card Protector, a poker player can not think of damaging his cards in his own hands. If you watch the poker tournaments on TV, you will find the leading players with a common bad habit of bending the cards or scratching the cards. They often regret for their deeds later on. However, their regrets don't bring their cards back. Sometimes, they are seen changing the cards during a game they are playing which may be devious for themselves. Sometimes, they lose the game only because of this simple habit. The leading card players have been always concerning and warning the new fellows out there so that they become extra caring for the pieces they play with.

Also, theres a condition called Anorexia Mirabilis which can be seen in ancient texts (it can still happen nowadays but it likely better diagnosed and treated) where people would religiously fast to death for the "spiritual benefits".

Out of position you might want to x/r a low flush draw on a dynamic board a high percentage of the time with an spr of 13, with an spr of 36 you might have to be much more careful (1) playing out of position on a board that may have a lot of texture shifts and where in position gains the ability to put immense pressure with a deeper stack and (2) putting non nutted hands in what may turn out to be a very polarized line at that spr. The same ideas will apply to some of your flop value x/r Some types of value hands will change from not having reverse implied odds to having them, depending on the spr. None of these examples feature pot odds as a significant consideration.

Cowboys Casino has been redefining how much fun a local casino can be ever since it opened for business in time for the 100th anniversary of the Calgary Stampede."It's a new experience like no other casino in Calgary," says Paul Vickers, president of Penny Lane Entertainment and the man behind legendary venues such as Cowboys Dance Hall.Bringing the Cowboys brand to a casino has given people a new style of entertainment, says Vickers.

A manuscript of the study was published online ahead of print by the journal Pain on April 29. "In other words, our results suggest that in some individuals something goes wrong with the body's 'fight or flight' response or the body recovery from this response, and persistent pain results."The study assessed the role of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, a physiologic system of central importance to the body response to stressful events.The study evaluated whether the HPA axis influences musculoskeletal pain severity six weeks after motor vehicle collision (MVC) and sexual assault.Its findings revealed that variation in the gene encoding for the protein FKBP5, which plays an important role in regulating the HPA axis response to stress, was associated with a 20 percent higher risk of moderate to severe neck pain six weeks after a motor vehicle collision, as well as a greater extent of body pain.The same variant also predicted increased pain six weeks after sexual assault.now, if an someone comes to the emergency department after a car accident, we don have any interventions to prevent chronic pain from developing, McLean said.

Speaking of auto flush idiots. I sometimes have to wear a high viz jacket to walk around fork lifts. I always forget to take my reflective jacket off and it sets off the laser in the urinals and toilets over and over. If I sitting the toilet will flush every 10 seconds or so till I remove my jacket. I do this every dang time too. I just know some guy is hearing me flushing over and over while sitting and puzzled all to hell over what it is I think I accomplishing.

Kann es da Zufall sein, dass die meisten Khlschrnke anfnglich jungfrulich wei sind, vorausgesetzt wir haben sie unbefleckt vom Lieferservice empfangen?

But if someone slaps a $20 bill down on the side of the board during a game of Sorry!   what the hell does that mean? How badass can an 8 year old be? Board games are just totally the wrong venue for wagering, and this act is really inappropriate, and not a little intimidating. And in games that are the right venue, like poker or U 12 coed soccer, there are a lot of unspoken rules around the size of the bets. Bets in the single  or double digit range can be fun among friends.

There are a number of research organisations within the effective altruism community dedicated to figuring out which interventions/charities are the most effective.

You could probably trick it though :), not sure if the orange 3.3v wires from the PSU would be enough but you could run one of those in the cable that goes to the mod and connect that to the balance charging pins on the board, it would now see 3x 3.3v, it would think the batteries are low but it should still fire. OR, connect one of these to a red 5v wire in the PSU which will reduce the voltage to 4.2v, and run that into the mod for the balanced charging pins! Then it should think there are 3 fully charged (4.2v) batteries attached :)..

Did you know that 95 percent of all retail sales in Sweden are cashless? And did you know that the government of Denmark has a stated goal of "eradicating cash" by the year 2030? All over the world, we are seeing a relentless march toward a cashless society, and nowhere is this truer than in northern Europe. In Sweden, hundreds of bank branches no longer accept or dispense cash, and thousands of ATM machines have been permanently removed.

Last year it took me 5 days to get from Kearsarge to VVR and then just grabbed a small amount of food to get from there to Mammoth. Red Meadow was not yet open and the bus was not running so I had to take the Mammoth Pass (think that is what it is called??) but it was super easy and not at all a "pass" like the others had been. I am going with the same strategy again this year because I will not know how many days worth of food I will need to get from Kearsarge to VVR, depends on how the snow looks when I get to Bishop.

The lawsuit would basically have to claim that Maguire and the others who won money from this man were "gifted" that money, and therefore they have to give it back since those funds were basically stolen as part of a Ponzi scheme. I think the courts will reject that claim. In some states anyone receiving cash over a certain dollar amount has to make a reasonable effort to ensure those funds are legitimate and not from an illegal enterprise ("reasonable effort" usually includes a call to the IRS), so if California has that there is a chance they could pursue the lawsuit on those grounds, but I still doubt that strategy will work..

I agree with you. I too know I am close to death and have accepted it. I also feel different about what is valuable in life than what I focused on without the threat of dieing. It is differcult to find someone to discuss the ultimat. end of our lives. Perhaps other people say those silly things because they don know what else to say? I think our society should review death differently instead of looking at it as a time of horror. :). For me there is comfort that my end is near. I have lived a long life.

I never paid for sex, but I would imagine that many of the negative factors change greatly on where you live. Just because you don see prostitutes walking the streets in a nicer area doesn mean they aren there. Some places where it legal make it significantly safer as well.All that aside, my understanding is that a bonus of hiring a prostitutes or escort means you can get right to your kink without embarrassment or working up to it with a regular relationship.

There's a difference between being prepared and memorizing answers, and I believe that as president, you need to be prepared for anything you can be. Presidents are given briefings outlining situations before acting on them. Most actions require some level of being able to take info from intelligence sources and applying them to the situation. Being given a short period to review and formulate ideas   not full responses   would show that better IMO. I know I would want to at least know "I am answering " to every question, and then draw upon my knowledge to formulate a proper discussion and response on the fly.

Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890, outlawing contracts and conspiracies restraining trade and/or monopolizing industries. For example, competing individuals or businesses may not fix prices, divide markets or rig bids. In 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, banning unfair competition methods and deceptive acts or practices. The Clayton Act was passed the same year, addressing specific practices the Sherman Act does not prohibit. For example, the Clayton Act prohibits having the same person make business decisions for competing corporations. The three antitrust laws describe unlawful mergers and business practices in general terms, leaving courts to decide which ones are illegal based on facts of each case.

Life has returned to a feudal system ruled by the Kalkar overlords, known as the Teivos or 'brothers', and enforced by the Kash Guard. For the human race life is horrific. Anyone can be killed by the Kalkars for any reason at any time following a military trial at which they are not allowed to speak. Women are considered the property of the state who can be claimed by the Kash Guard at will and for this reason girls are either hidden, disfigured or killed by their parents at birth8. Taxation is so high that the general population barely survive and many are prepared to betray their neighbours for rewards as little as extra eggs to eat. Power struggles between the bureaucratic Teivos and the military Kash Guard are common. In the ruins of Chicago where Julian 9th lives the commander of the Kash Guard is Or tis, a cruel and ambitious descendant of Orthis, who dreams of being Jemadar of the United Teivos of America.

 5 points  submitted 2 days agoWhy are posts that are tweets/content videos from the official teams being removed? I can see an argument if it was in not English w/o subs, but the rest of the content is all great and it's amazing to see more teams doing something this season, so their content should be visible to everyone and not removed because of some rule. Official Team content/tweets etc should be an exception as they are the official pro teams either making a meme about a match, or giving insight to how their team works, no reason any of that should be removed since it's the pro teams you watch play this game. 1 point  submitted 2 days agoNot everything nor am I say everything like you imply. A pro team talking about a match on twitter is on the relevancy scale and a pro team publishing highlights of their voice comms and life leading up to those matches is 100% very relevant as its insight to how a pro league team plays league. If you guys are going to keep nuking posts that are just those things then get rid of the pro team flairs and stop posting match results, otherwise you are having one without the other when you should have both and not having both is being hypocritical. Also so with the initial posts yesterday that got removed that prompted to ask my question they all had different reasons which didn't make sense that weren't relevancy.Edit: an example of how bad it is to remove posts that pertains to the pro teams is it's a like a food and health based sub reddit banning posts about sugar and artificial sugar but allowing posts about candy.

1.) Video Poker   Assume we are playing Jacks or Better and the payout schedule will give us a return of 99.5%. This is based on getting a royal flush a certain percentage of hands, a full house another percentage, and so on. For the long term, we naturally think that we will lose 50 cents for every $100 we put through the machine. But this would be true only if the long term meant playing an infinite number of hands. In reality, we never play an infinite number of hands and our luck will determine what side of 99.5% we will fall. For example, if we are lucky and get more than our share of royal flushes and other high payouts, our return will be greater than 100% and we will make money. But if we get less than our share, our return will be much lower than the 99.5% average and we will lose a lot more than 50 cents for every $100 we bet.

His daughter describes him as " a very positive, fun, down to earth person."But, at the same time, I think it behooves us to consider how much Serling was pulling from personal demons when he wrote characters wrestling with personal demons and, to get to the meat of your question, why this resonated with so many Americans in the late 50s and early 60s.The dark underbelly of 1950 suburbia has become an assumed truth of fiction.
