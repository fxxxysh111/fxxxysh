I know that kind of vague, so let me give some examples. Let take a look at one of the core mechanics of Auto Chess: the piece shop. Every turn you offered 5 chess pieces that you can buy. or not. I consider this "good" RNG. Why? Because even though you not always going to get your preferred outcome, other new opportunities are still open to you. You may be thinking "damn, I didn get what I wanted", but you quickly move on to "but maybe I should buy this piece for later" or "at least I can buy out these pieces to deny them to that other player who wants them", etc.

I lived in Florida for the first 18 years of my life and spent most of my free time outdoors, fishing, camping, what have you. The summer before my junior year of high school I found myself out hiking nearby by my home with a buddy. We were stomping around in some clay deposits inside of a little ravine (even minimal geographic relief is dramatic in a place as flat as the gulf coast) when it started to Florida rain (for those of you who can't relate, imagine a torrential downpour). Our minds immediately jumped to the exciting possibility of a flash flood raging through the crevasses we were exploring. In an effort to make our day more exciting and not take any chances, we began to climb vertically out of the canyons versus take the lengthy path out of it horizontally. We got to the top, put our feet on the ground, and did pull up. As I stood up I felt the ground underneath me squirm. I had stepped on a snake.

Achieving balance means more than just performing well in all three sports; it also extends to balancing your life with triathlon training and finding mental balance. The variety of multisport training can help to break the monotony of training for just one sport, and this helps keep athletes interested and engaged. However, most triathletes naturally favor one of the three sports, making them weaker in others. Seasoned triathletes will agree that you can't afford to overlook any of the three sports, and figuring out how to juggle all three is key to competing in a triathlon.

Leaning back in the chair, talking about anything other than the current hand, getting up to grab a beer, talking to players other than your opponent, folding your arms, etc etc all communicate weakness.

Then, today, out of nowhere, this "other" user messages me trying to say again that I celebrate rape and said that he deserved it, which of course I did not. I though he was just a drama troll, so I wanted to RES tag him so I knew not to take the bait if I saw his posts anywhere.

IDK for sure, it just would be a big coincidence. Then I see this user post here with the same story, being raped and being a conservative and how "nobody cares", but this time he was raped by a woman.

I just want to say that both are horrifically terrible at moderating their communities. The amount of shitposting and trolling in bad faith that I see on those platforms is staggering.

Thank goodness I have managed to return, although with a different research number (still the same me!!) and I am debating whether I can call myself Also Ran1 as my new nickname? Hope so.

Like many people, I had always thought that poker was mostly about luck, being able to bluff, and reading people. I learned that for limit hold 'em poker (which was the most popular type of poker in casinos at the time), none of that really mattered much in the long run. For every hand and every round of betting, there was actually a mathematically correct way to play that took into account the "pot odds" (the ratios among the amount of the bet, the number of chips already in the pot, and the statistical chances of winning).

Eventually, you'll want to memorize these names so you can easily refer to different tiles and pairs. The names of all the tiles and their corresponding pairs are:[9]

In any case, contrary to OP's assertion, we do indeed care about marathoner health. That is exactly why we have 10,000 volunteers on course   one for every 2 3 runners   with water, Gatorade, medical aid, etc. In fact I used to be part of the training crew for one of the big charity teams of the marathon. (The charity teams take amateur runners; you don't have to make the official qualifying times if you're running for charity. Which means charity teams end up with a lot of people doing their first marathon). The team leaders train the new runners for nearly an entire year in stuff like, how to train up gradually over months   they did training runs together, of gradually increasing length, for 10 months. (I would wait halfway with water and carb gel packs, and with my car available in case anybody needed to bail). And tons of advice about shoe choices, clothes choices, race pace strategy, watching out for overuse injuries, how much water to drink, whether to use carb gels, how to train for hills, and, yes, what/when to eat so as to avoid needing bathroom breaks. I mean. is OP totally unaware there is a whole world of advice coaching about how to run marathons healthily and safely? Yes, we want everybody to be healthy, marathoners as well as the obese.

To conclude that "CODE doesn have anything in common with the best unis in the world" from what I said is a logical fallacy. That not what I said or implied.

I actually surprised by all the hate and downvotes it is getting here, as for me and many others this university was a game changer. People are so mad that CODE students actually enjoy and believe in their university. I mean, how dare they, haven they heard school is supposed to suck??

Typically, novices will start out playing for free and very many people do this. Once my confidence was up, and I knew what I knew and what I didn't know, I invested $20 in a bankroll and played high rolling 1c/2c games.

The low stakes keep the sharks away. I never once thought of it as gambling, it's a game with a slight bonus financial element.

Here you can walk for miles and see no one. The Marriott's spa is run by Mandara, the Bali based spa company. The ten couple's treatment suites include indoor and outdoor space, which is good for pairs who have different temperature preferences. Notable treatments: Healing Hot Stones massage ($108) and Thai massage($61) therapist Upadee Tansom is slender but has extraordinarily strong hands. Guest rooms are large and elegant, with great ocean views and raised sala areas with massage mats and triangular cushions. Thumbs down: the cuisine, especially the breakfast buffet.

He says "I sorry" no if or buts and he sounds genuine when he does it, if it a small issue it ends there, if it a bigger issue then he usually briefly outline a plan for avoiding whatever situation occured in the future. I apologize in exactly the same way.

Another fun kind of 100 plastic playing cards are the transparent cards.

Genesis says marriage is one man with one woman for a lifetime." By affirming God's standard, Jesus was saying that any deviation from that standard not just gay marriage but any deviation, such as adultery, premarital sex, or unbiblical divorce is sin because it doesn't measure up to the perfect standard of God. Jesus said marriage is one man with one woman for a lifetime.

NTA   Are you just supposed to sit there while he gives your girlfriend a teddy bear, very clearly trying to steal her from you? Of course not. I mean, ideally, she would have stepped up and been more forcefully clear with the guy, but for anyone who had their hearts broken, I can sympathize with her not wanting to bring that pain on someone else. But the fact of the matter is that sometimes you just have to, and she really should have by politely refusing to accept the gift. Anyways, assuming that she really isn into him, then you did her a favour here.
Some doctors may prescribe medication, and while undoubtedly helpful in many cases mothers should think carefully before taking them. Most common anti depressants, such as prozac or seroxat, are not safe to take while breast feeding, and it is important to be sure that the medicine will make up for any feeling of guilt that may be caused by ceasing to give the baby the best, most natural food available to it. In the UK at present the only drug breast feeding mothers can take for depression is dotheipin. This not only combats the depression, but has a sedative effect which helps the insomnia. However it can cause side effects, the most common of which is very heavy sweating, which can cause discomfort and embarrassment to the mother. Testing medicines on breast feeding women is ethically prohibited, so the situation surrounding medicines is not likely to change any time soon.

The supplementation is helpful for fibromyalgia patients suffering from low vitamin D levels, say researchers in the journal PAIN.In addition to pain and fatigue, individuals diagnosed with FMS may experience sleep disorders, morning stiffness, poor concentration, and occasionally mild to severe mental symptoms such as anxiety or depression.The condition can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life, resulting in loss of employment and/or withdrawal from social life.There is no cure, and no treatment will address all of the symptoms, but some symptoms may be alleviated by physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, temporary drug therapy (such as amitriptyline, duloxetine, or pregabaline) and multimodal therapies.Calcifediol is a prehormone produced in the liver by the enzyme cholecalciferol (vitamin D3).Calcifediol is then converted to calcitriol (1,25 (OH)2D3), which is the active form of vitamin D. The concentration of calcifediol in blood is considered the best indicator of vitamin D status.Researchers hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation would reduce the degree of chronic pain experienced by FMS patients with low levels of calcifediol and also might improve other symptoms."Low blood levels of calcifediol are especially common in patients with severe pain and fibromyalgia."We therefore set out to determine whether raising the calcifediol levels in these patients would alleviate pain and cause a general improvement in concomitant disorders."In a randomized controlled trial, 30 women with FMS with low serum calcifediol levels (below 32ng/ml) were randomized to a treatment or control group.The goal for the treatment group was to achieve serum calcifediol levels between 32 and 48ng/ml for 20 weeks via oral cholecalciferol supplements.Serum calcifediol levels were reevaluated after five and 13 weeks, and the dose was reviewed based on the results. The calcifediol levels were measured again 25 weeks after the start of the supplementation, at which time treatment was discontinued, and after a further 24 weeks without supplementation.Twenty four weeks after supplementation was stopped, a marked reduction in the level of perceived pain occurred in the treatment group.Between the first and the 25th week on supplementation, the treatment group improved significantly on a scale of physical role functioning, while the placebo group remained unchanged.The treatment group also scored significantly better on a Fibromalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) on the question of "morning fatigue." However, there were no significant alterations in depression or anxiety symptoms."We believe that the data presented in the present study are promising.

It just a failure of reading comprehension on your part. They aren saying "90% of police encounters with black people result in a shooting." They are saying that, when they hear about the police encountering a black person, they expect it to end in a shooting 90% of the time. This isn a circle jerk for two reasons. First, as I explained, they are explaining their expectation, which requires no support from any data at all. Second, given that they are referring not to all police encounters with black people, but rather the ones they hear about, it isn unreasonable to suggest that a very high percentage of news worthy encounters do in fact end in violence. The vase majority of police encounters do not make the news. When they do they very frequently involve police violence.

Rather than "orfu vils (mosy) prs ullomis?," these speakers would say "orfu vils prs ullomis, mosy?"When speaking to a superior in a formal setting or giving a speech, the A not A form is generally preferred, regardless of assumed truth value, and the other forms are only used for rhetorical effect.Amiru and Vanawo speakers are in close cultural contact with one another and, as a result, borrow names between one another. Generally, they phonetically borrowed. Sometimes, they might be literally translated, so Yagha, meaning "flower," would become Ukau, or Itsostwazro, meaning "bonded with the gods," would become Wekesitawushanule.Along with that is transposing naming customs. 
That's what I figured, but the letter was still pretty shitty when it meant nothing. Beyond that, at my workplace, we ship expensive tables with FedEx. We make it clear that the contents of the crates are fragile and expensive but they still find a way to fuck it up. One of the worst stories I have heard is that they disassembled one of our pallets in order to create more space and ended up spearing the crates with their pallet jacks. Can you find an explanation for that?

Since we have the manila protocol Dr here on this forum I think we should ask this question. Does prostate drainage offer symptom relief? I have read hundreds of story's saying no, Many from x manila patients. Yet there are a few out there who were helped or cured from massage. I wonder if the cured were the small percent of suffers with true bacterial prostatitis. Or does massaging actually help release the tense pelvic floor muscles when done, offering some relief? My doc tried the protocol with little results. And has stopped doing it for his patients. some say the anti inflammatory effects from antibiotics, combined with massage may also play a role in some patients getting short term relief.

My boyfriend and I had decided to commit suicide together, we were heroin addicts, had screwed up our lives and just wanted to quit. We stole $500 from my mother, and a bottle of her Xanax. We used the money to buy a shit ton of heroin. It was the middle if the night, and we stole her car to go buy the drugs, and we did it in the car in the parking lot of my apartment. I guess I didn want her to find me in the apartment, I didn want her to be the one to find us. So we both took about 15 Xanax pulls, and filled several syringes full of heroin. I only was able to do about two syringes worth until I fell out and was unconcious. It wasn enough to die, just pass out. But I stayed unconcious in the car for about twelve hours, he did too. I guess someone found us, and called the ambulance. I had fallen out with a syringe still in my arm, and tied off, and layed in a hot Tex summer car for several hours. Next thing I remember was waking up in the ICU, and boyfriend had already been taken to jail for possession. My arm didn work, from muscle damage we think from the way the medical pulled my arm to get me out of the car, because it was not the arm I was injecting in to. My arm could not straighten out and I had no use it movement in my fingers. It stayed that way for a year, and still doesn have full sensations in my first get tips. Once I was being realeased for icu I was arrested for possession and went to jail.

Thank you for this info! I am considering doing Max's list because I am bringing my girlfriend to see wonders at dusk and sleep no more again for her birthday. Wonders at dusk ends at around 8:30 and sleep no more starts at 9:00, if we do Max's list we will have no worries getting right in and will add a little more magic to the night getting that vip experience. If we didn't do Max's list how big of a wait do you believe we'd find ourselves in after wonders at dusk trying to get into sleep no more?

And on top of everything, YOU are so angry at HER for regretting having sex with you?? You are a massive asshole.
But what if Smith dies at 67? Then his estate/survivor can take advantage of some little known provisions of the OAS Act. His executor can apply to begin Smith OAS pension with the effective starting date set as one year prior to the date of death. Keep in mind that OAS payments always end on death: our concern here is merely the opportunity to collect for the one year prior to death. Wealth) says such cases are still new but become an unfortunate reality for many Canadians. So, if you planning to postpone your OAS, you should include some precautionary measures in your financial plan. that your executor is aware of the post death OAS application and option to file a Separate Rights or Things tax return. (That an optional tax return for specific types of income still receivable at death.) This would shift the OAS lump sum away from the final tax return, where taxable income might be high enough to result in a clawback of OAS benefits.

I was in a mental facility after a suicide attempt. A few days in, we got this guy with, lord knows what, but he was very different. During one of his rare moments of clarity, he told us that his parents dropped him off there, moved to some unknown place, changed their numbers, deleted their social media, and couldn be found or reached by anyone.

It did set world records for lifting stuff, but beyond that, it was a half dead behemoth.
