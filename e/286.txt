I mean, I have no doubt that people will believe the DA and judge would throw away their careers for a former county commissioner son who works at Dari Mart, but that on them. I mean, c what is the deal? Why did it happen quite like this? It looks like somebody was very upset and pulled the trigger on a process which can be stopped, once started, but afterward had something like a change of heart on the matter. Amazingly, the DA and judge (because the judge has to sign off on a plea deal) looked at the case in it totality and still decided that any jail time was too much..

For some people, avoiding triggers and using allergy medicine is not enough to control or prevent their allergy symptoms. Allergy injections may offer an alternative if symptoms are severe. There are several different terms used to describe allergy injections, including allergy vaccination, immunotherapy, and allergy desensitization shots. In this treatment, small amounts of the trigger substance are injected into the patient. Over time, the amount of the substance injected increases until the body becomes tolerant to the substance and no longer reacts.

I went to an event last night and one of the things the charity does is give education grants. One grant was given to a dietitian masters student studying the effect high BMI has on the prenatal/postnatal care on women. That in itself is good as being overweight shouldn mean poor healthcare or being treated shitty but in her speech it became apparent that her study is more along the "fatlogic" line that weight loss is way more complicated than CICO and she wants to create a place where there is no discussion of obesity or weight when talking to pregnant women. I guess I just don advocate doctors ignoring one component of health. She was saying things like dietitians need to believe patients when they say what they eat, etc. It was cringey for me as I feel when it comes to eating habits people are generally unreliable narrators and you cannot trust the self reporting. I also expect my doctor to politely and respectfully discuss my weight just as my doctor politely and respectfully told me I was advanced maternal age and what effects that could have on my daughter and my pregnancy. My doctor didn say your fat ass is old to be having a baby or it is a geriatric pregnancy and she didn act like I would be a bad parent having a baby at a later age. She just directly discussed with me and my husband what tests she recommends, etc. (ex. we had a meeting with a geneticist, had the fold screen, etc) for 1st time pregnant women of an older age.
As we recently pointed out, the final morning of serial killer John Doe's master plan was the mother of all messy errands. But of course, that stamina was all worth our jaws dropping at the reveal that Brad Pitt's character, Detective Mills, was one of the final "sins" in his themed murder spree. Specifically, after Doe killed Mills' wife, the detective became "wrath" to Doe's murderous "envy" of his perfect life.

As much as anyone, Rivers Cuomo established the contours of the modern rock hit as we know it, and as punishment he's doomed to dopily haunt its commercial confines forever.

There are currently no proven health benefits to IF (though I certain some experiments are in the works), any experiments/analysis that have been done thus far have small, pretty much all male samples. The only benefit to IF is that, for some folks, it aligns better to their preferred natural eating habits and gives them a framework for fewer, larger meals. Especially when dealing with low TDEEs, the smaller eating window can make you feel more satiated.

In the beginning levels of poker, the game is all about playing tight and conservative. Play good cards and fold the bad ones and you are pretty much guaranteed to make money at the lower levels of poker. At the low levels no one knows how to fold. Just pay attention to whose playing like a maniac (hint it going to be more than half the table at 1$/2$) and wait them out. Once you get a good hand bet it hard.
So if a large mass jumps up and the lands, their body has to withstand the force of the impact.

The other guy made one last comment before he got banned from the forum. I would imagine he lying to you about a lot of things, including how profitable he is at poker. Get proactive about this now. Get on your facebook group, 2p2 marketplace, anywhere you can and name and shame him. It entirely possible that he oversold to the sat (did you really make the offer to him, or did he start saying "Oh man, the national championships are coming up and I know I crush in them, if only all my money wasn tied up with this move.") or that he doing or is planning to steal from other people. The best thing for you to do is to get him to buy you out of your equity ($900) since you can really trust that he going to pay you. It would be a bit rich for me to go to the fb group etc cos I was telling the other guy how it is none of his business what deal we do and saying that he was just jealous that he couldn play in the big game etc and my friend got that guy banned from the group, he a bit of a minor celebrity in poker circles in my town/country so I don want to rock the boat too much. I will be at the tournament to get my 10% if he does cash though for sure and I don think I will be making any more deals with him based on the feedback here. I asked him about this and he said that the other guy was just a jealous loser and reiterated the numbers so I don think I am going to get more than 10%.
Doyle Brunson later claimed that he'd never seen anyone pick up the game as quickly as Stuey. In 1980 he became the youngest ever winner of the World Series of Poker (WSOP)Main Event and was christened with a new nickname, "The Kid", a reference to his tender age and scrawny frame. 
I haven't been there in over a year, but from what I remember, low stakes now means 4 8 limit or $100 buy in no limit   the limits have gone up in recent years. The Excalibur is the kindergarten of casino poker. I recommend going there if it's his first time at the casino. The best low limit game I found was at the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street downtown. The 4 8 game had the same rake as the 2 4 game and about the same number of terrible players. Four Queens, Binions, and The Plaza also have poker downtown.

Second, there the deeply held belief that any leakage between the private and the public is a threat. In the Victorian Era, there was an absolute obsession with keeping the public and private spheres separate. The home was private, clean, feminine and safe. The city was public, masculine, dirty and dangerous. No doubt the early obsession with marking private from public stemmed from urbanization and immigration. There was a lot of crossing of boundaries. Classes and races mixed together. Middle class women shifted their roles from private producers of domestic goods to public shoppers for such goods. Soap and cleaning products were some of the first products advertised, and they were advertised as a way to keep ourselves clean by not allowing our private worlds to be polluted with the "filth" of the public world.
SS with 15bb. I can remember seeing anyone with such an small stack and some kind of strategy. Is there actually a working strategy for a 15bb stack? It mostly fish that lost most of their stack and don fill up, because the are too scared to loose too much. They bet any pair and any Ax or often just trash. I call with 88+, AT+. Good news is, they they min 3B or 2x 3B their AA more often if heads up (not so much when they squeeze) and want to take the rest postflop. But since a lot of fish min 3B trash too, I call anything here.

My dad always says that the trick is to force them to cuddle, not like in a mean way where you are hurting them, but constantly pet them and pick them up brush them, just a lot of contact and eventually they come around. When we were kids we pretty much forced her to cuddle and eventually she just gave in. I think part of it is that as kids getting these cats was a huge deal and once we got them we were so excited we couldn leave them alone.

Your cost basis will be the fair market value of the shares as of the gift date, not your fathers basis. So it depends when the shares were gifted to you. If the shares have gone up since the gift you will pay a capital gains tax on the amount over your cost basis. If they have gone down you will be able to deduct up to 3000 of the loss. I am not a tax professional although I do work in accounting so I am not sure how disability is treated, but I do not believe it is treated as income. So likely you will be in the lower capital gains bracket if you have no other income.

I play a mix of online and live 1/2. Something you will definitely have to get used to is the pace of live play. Live plays so much slower than online and without the option of playing 6 max it feels even slower. That being said live is softer than 1cent 2 cent from my experience, I only play at night on the weekends when it is really soft. I would suggest playing tighter than you do online. Even at the lowest stakes online it is rare to see a pot get raised and have all the players come along, in live 1/2 this is almost standard. My strategy has been to bet big preflop with premium hands and try to get in cheaply with suited connectors and medium pocket pairs. I have consistently raised to 15 dollars preflop with Aces and gotten at least one caller sometimes 2. If they make top pair they usually won lay down their hand to continued aggression as well. If your pocket pair or suited connector hits start betting big for value especially if the pot is multiway or if you think the board might hit the villain range in any way again the biggest leak is in 1/2 is not being able to get away from a made hand. Now you should be aware that there will most likely be at least one or two good players at the table with you. But these players are easy to spot, if you get in a pot heads up with them don be afraid to actually play cards with them. But with the usual 1/2 player, you can play your hands very straightforwardly and still make a profit.

That also wasnt new with the last republican house. Republicans go back to the hastert rule every single solitary time they are in power. And dems go back to the american rules.

In their first foody challenge, contestants were forced to suck down a gut busting portion of wasabi before navigating chaotic Tokyo with a group of audience members to the first pit stop.

Shinichi Mochizuki, probably one of the most fascinating mathematicians alive today. For 20 years, he worked in relative isolation creating a ridiculously powerful and abstract theory to solve one of the biggest unsolved problems in math, the ABC Conjecture. His results have been known since 2012, but even the best mathematicians alive can understand it yet. There was a big conference at the beginning of the year to assess whether or not the ideas seemed legit enough to invest the hundreds/thousands of hours that even the top mathematicians would need to invest to understand Mochizuki ideas. There are some pretty good layman articles about him out there.

The way I see it you gotta invest heavily with time or money to make this work. You could just go and get a sex change but that the easy way out. Nah, that won do. Okay, here what you do. Start buying in with the minimum, every time. Even when you get stack, minimum. And stop using 50s 100s or even 20s to buy in. Yeah, 5s and 10s only from here on out. Next step is to hide in plain sight. They be looking for the quite type. You gotta be loud, ya hear? I saying, you gotta make ever dumb poker joke you can at every possible time.

" you know you can check, right? Every time, all of these spots you gotta hammer these jokes in. Over and over. I suggest taking notes on common jokes the recs use.

One thing about genestealers being "immune" to warp corruption though. The Warp doesn care about "science". Genetics, physical traits, materials, etc. The only exception we ever seen is the Black Stone used in the Cadian Pylons and the Black Stone Fortresses. Black Stone isn immune, but it can be used to amplify or suppress the warp. It not impossible that Genestealers/Tyranids have a similar property, but I personally don think that the case.

For example, ATs is a high frequency raise facing a 1/3 PSB on T72r, but is far less likely to be raised vs. A 100% PSB on the same board. As bet size decreases, the betting range becomes more merged, and therefore you can raise wider for value.

The more I play with reaper, the more I both think he is broken, and not. I think he was just "fixed" poorly. My first thought was to revert back to the old reaper, but make SS instant, but have it also start the cooldown over on wraith, so he can bamf in, kill, and wraith out. 
But in all these years, I never saw a single attack news related to Abottabad while areas above and below it were getting bombed like hell. So it was obvious that something fishy exists in Abottabad and that entity is protected by every player in the region as country premier military training academy is in the same city (for those who think of academy as a reason of no news, terrorists even attacked Army HQs in capital city, an academy was an easy target)..

Sleep sounds like a given, right? Not so much. While your friends and family are reminding you to "stock up on sleep" before the midnight feedings start (as if that's even possible), a full night's shut eye becomes more and more elusive thanks to your changing body shape, late night leg cramps, endless trips to the bathroom, and your husband's snoring (which never used to keep you up!). Improve your pregnancy sleep by developing a consistent, calming pre bedtime routine, and make sure you take the opportunity to grab a nap whenever possible to feel more rested throughout the day.

There are many methods of self hypnosis. Here's one that's fairly easy. Choose a positive statement that expresses a desire. For instance, "Each breath makes me feel more relaxed." Once you have the statement in mind, lie down and take three slow, deep breaths. Close your eyes and, starting at your head, begin using your affirmation statement on different parts of your body. "Each breath makes my forehead more relaxed." As you breathe, imagine releasing any tension in that part of your body when you exhale. Move to the next part: "Each breath makes my jaw more relaxed." Continue using the same affirmative statement with various parts of your body until you finish with your toes.

The Negro will often try pushing you off a hand by raising the turn. In fact, because it is in his nature, he will probably raise every street, and only fold when it is clear that his aggressive betting and intrinsic ability to inspire terror in more gentle peoples will not allow him to "steal" the pot. Of course, after the game breaks up, he will be waiting in an alley, brandishing some sort of primitive weapon in an effort to regain by force the money his feeble mind and lack of self control cost him.

I continued to lose money and had a particularly bad month. I was down to about 10k. One of my roommates had been suggesting for months that I keep some empty heads up tables open while I played 6 max and if anyone sat me, to play them and that it would definitely be easier than playing only 6 max. I had been unwilling to do that because I thought HU was harder and I was already losing so much, I didn want to risk trying to learn a new game and lose even faster. I had no choice now, though. I was desperate and I needed to do something, anything at all.

Austerity will be a death knell to this city and province. The corpse just started to rise in the coffin from the 90s, now Pallister is clubbing it over the head.

The economy will continue to tank as public resources dwindle, private investment follows. Pallister will serve on dozens of boards and spend just enough time in Canada to take advantage of socialized health care when he wants to.

Don't get star struck. You'll see many of the poker stars that are regularly on TV and if you enter some bracelet events you may be pitted against some of them. Always remember, though, that you're still sitting at a standard sized poker table and playing with the same standard 52 card deck. It's like the scene in "Hoosiers" when Coach Norman Dale has his players measure the height of the hoop in Indianapolis   still the standard 10 feet. The competition may seem greater, but the game is still the same.
Oh this a huge lie from the tv show. First "in plain sight" is wrong. The key was hidden in a bookcase, with the back panel broken. Colborn was searching the bookcase, and shoved all the porn/magazines back in. He pulled the bookcase away from the wall. When searching it and shoving everything back in, the key fell out the back. So when he slid it back up against the wall, the key was laying behind where the bookcase had just been. It hadn been laying in the open the whole time.
Andere moderne deutsche Diktatur ist natrlich die DDR, zumindest ja ein Unrechtsstaat, aber einen Genozid und einen warmen Krieg kann man der DDR nicht vorwerfen. Stasi, Mauer und kalter Krieg waren ja aber schlimm genug.
"If it was based on luck instead of skill, then anyone could win these tournaments, so how come the same players keep winning all the time?" asks Levy, a former rugby league player whose father Mark represented Penrith, Parramatta and Balmain. "Tournament poker is a sport because for me, the skill I possess is going to make me a better player than another person   not the luck I get on the day. I do need a certain element of physical fitness to sit at a table and be mentally strong for 16 hours." Where is the boundary drawn between sport and gaming? Chess is considered a game, but chess boxing is surely a sport because of the physical component. 
Of the many things that can be said about manure you can say but can say about its chemical replacement is that it is made from fossil fuels and sucks good stuff from the soil and ultimately makes the farmland it is fertilizing unfarmable. That what popped into my head when I bumped into this woodcut of a manure spreader while farming something else in the 1829 volume of The Journal of the Franklin Institute. It a relatively simple improvement to a necessary and laborious job adding the spreader made the application of manure far easier than have it slide through a jamable sluice in the bottom of a wagon, and certainly a lot easier and more thorough than spreading it by hand.

He dropped me off, and refused to take any money, and just asked that I pass on a favour if I was able to. I still think about that, and how that situation could have gone so very very much worse. It was so totally selfless, and so opposite of anyone I knew at the time, it really made me reconsider my friend group, which was a good thing, and also made me desperately sad that I had nobody to call to help me when I really needed it..

What buy in are they playing compared to what they usually play? Someone could be on a bad losing streak at the $50 buy in, and finds himself trying to bankroll at the $10 buy ins. They may tend to be more impatient and inclined to tilt. On the other hand, moving up a level or two usually means the player is going to be much tighter.. 
It a real strange situation where the people who bother to buy tickets and show up to the live event are somehow "not reacting correctly to the thing they paid for". Crowds can be lame, I guess, but the crowd is there to be sports entertained, not necessarily be part of the sports entertainment. And so WWE bears at least some responsibility for the reaction of their fans.
Well, it pretty much a barter system and a way to have your characters indebted to others (and to call on others for support). I don think it needs to be in the game at all and removing it wouldn change a thing.

I wonder if the people who hate this episode see too much of themselves in it. I know I was desperately afraid of being one of these people when I was 23, and when my friend moved into my place and turned into one of them, it made me actually despise her for a time afterwards. But I realized part of the reason I couldn emphasize with her behavior, even though i knew she had a history of depression, was because of the fear that I was always one bad turn from becoming her..

Although it is possible your fingerboard is warping, there should be a curve to your board, just about how you described it. A board with no curve to it is more likely to buzz. If you want to post a pic with the straightedge against the board so I can see the dip, it will help confirm, but it more likely that the temperature and humidity changes between summer and winter have brought the neck angle up, and that why the bridge seems low. 
I don't know anything for certain about the legality of playing online. My lay understanding is this: (1) Congress forbade banks from transferring money to many kinds of poker sites; (2) although this does not criminalize playing at those sites, (3) it does effectively filter out the fish, making it much harder to skim an easy profit than it had been in 2004.

How can anyone be happy about another fucking pizza place. Especially with Taglio just announcing they are moving into Lacheys. Also who wants to be up by rhinegeist where nothing is open at 3am 4am.

OTR really needs to diversify or these places will start to close. Additionally OTR was always the no chain zone, pretty disappointed they added Aladdin's, LouVino, Pins Mechanical, Urban Axes, and now this.

There are plenty ofunique design features of the B787 Dreamliner, although it is difficult to show them in pictures. However, one of the biggest design facets of the 787 is the upward curved wingspan, which reduces drag and gives a smoother ride. Also built in to the design of the 787 is a unique filtration system that is said to eliminate (or at least reduce) bacteria and odour in the cabin air, which is a godsend if you sitting next to a smelly passenger! The windows on the 787 are also around 30% larger than on other aircraft, and these windows have LED shades that can replicate the sunrise and sunset.

I literally had a friend do this to me. She required 2 weeks off of work for the bridal shower, Bachelorette party, prewedding party and wedding. Each one was several days and a destination,required a gift, and required the bridal party to fund them including the brides portions. It totaled $3000. I noped the fuck out of that after trying to unsuccessfully explain that I do not have $3k nor 2 weeks off work to give to her wedding. The worst part was that my SO was in the grooms party and had similar requirements so the couple was literally asking us to spend 6k on their wedding/parties.

On the flop betting betting is fine when checked around. His bet sizing is small enough to get value from marginal holdings such as flush draws, small pocket pairs and worse 7x hands. On the turn he bets less than half pot to get value from those types of hands. The river he folds because he holding the Ah, which blocks her bluffs, she almost never betting the river for value with a worse hand than what he holding.

To apply the cream correctly, dab it over the entire nail and cuticle, and massage it in.

As much as I love Nick, I don know that he will take on a bigger role. We been told through interviews that June really is meant to be the main character, and we are supposed to see the show primarily through her lens. I not confident that June will get to see Nick a whole lot in Season 3, so I not sure that we will either. Also, a main message of the show is supposed to be that women don need men to save them. That not to say that Nick can be involved in and supportive of the rebellion, but I don think that they will make Nick into a main character. There are so many other female characters to be fleshed out (Rita, Aunt Lydia, other handmaids, Mrs Lawrence, etc), that I don think we will get an abundance of background on Nick. Don get me wrong, I a big Nick fan and I want to see him on screen more too! Just not sure how likely it is.

I know everyone's mad about the no call at the end but that's not the first time it's happened at the end of any game. How many times have we seen officials swallow their whistles in the last seconds of NBA games? I've seen Lillard go for this same play many times before and not get called at the rim, he's gotta start reading the defense after those breakdowns and hit the open man, Hood was open in the corner with like 4 seconds left. I agree it was a terrible call, but players need to learn not to leave the game in the hands of the officials like that, they aren't going to get the call.

Some analysts put their tactics down to "lunacy", others to irrationality. But this gambit was far more rational than most commentators realised. It reminded me of Richard Nixon's well concocted madman strategy to make the Vietnamese think he was crazy enough to blow up their dykes or even drop the big one. It was a well calculated fear tactic, a shrewd manoeuvre in a game of psychological warfare.
