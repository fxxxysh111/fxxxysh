I put a mood tracking app on my phone. Entered my mental state when walking up, mid day and end of day (the app I used was just a smile, straight face or frown).

Now all of that being said, judging at face value the guy seems to kind of be a bit of a douchebag that knew there was no present threat, but that some serious armchair quarterbacking which I have a very hard time doing. But it kind of Darwinism at its finest, why would you want to stand and ever decide it a good idea to shove and begin an altercation with a guy in full riot gear armed with a less lethal shotgun or bean bag launcher?
This is because expected payoffs are ALWAYS different and it will never be proper to utilise pure randomisation. A good example of this is in tennis serves, where the direction of shot has to be randomly distributed in order to skew the expected payoff of returning. Djokovic does this very well.

If people came to my ministry naked I'd have thought "what a good job I'm doing"..

In 978, Edward visited his brother thelred and thelred's mother lfthryth, Edward's step mother, at their home in Corfe. Whilst there, he was murdered, presumably by lfthryth, and thelred became King at the age of about ten. Edward's body was left until 980 before being given a proper burial. His murder and lack of proper action by thelred to either bury or avenge his death meant that thelred II was, from the start of his reign, an unpopular king. When Edward was finally buried in 980 at Shaftesbury, miracles were considered to have happened near to his grave, which led to the adoption of his title 'the Martyr'.

Felonies. Yes we all know people who have them and some for really good reasons. But I don think this should be an excuse to take away your right to vote for life nor your Second Amendment rights for life. Now, hear me out. Look at all the felonies we have in this country. Is it fair that someone who commits fraud should no longer own a gun or vote? I can understand if you go in with a pistol and shoot up a 7Eleven, then I think you shouldn be allowed your weapon for a while but still, you should be allowed to vote. I think for Second Amendment rights it should be by the crime and once you have done your time, you should be on a list for like 7 or 10 years and if you don do any more crimes after that, then your right should be reinstated. We hold judgment over people even after prison which is wrong. Would you hold that same judgment on your child who just got out of time out? No. You move on and if they keep repeating the pattern you do your best to change the behavior. This is the same with prison. Some people never learn and we know this. But others do, and I think they should be given the respect they deserve. If you think about all our laws and you think about all the things that could make you a felon, then you will see what I am talking about. You could someday be in the same situation, wouldn you want dignity and respect once you came out? Wouldn you want your right to vote or have a firearm? We all would and we all should.

It is locked to canonical repository, there was a way to add third party repositories that wasn really usable (to the point i would say in practice there is no way to add them), and it got removed. Also the server side code is closed source (therefore, vendor locked to canonical).

The fact that this guy managed to make up a story about 2 white men in MAGA hats, wandering around Chicago at 2AM, one of the most liberal cities in the country, carrying bleach and a rope, and not a single person either stopped them or called the cops, should have been a gigantic Tiannamen level square flag. The "This is MAGA Country" they supposedly yelled, or the fact that the attack just happened to occur out of sight of cameras, or the fact that these racists somehow recognized a black, gay man who has a supporting role in a show with a majority black cast was WAY too much.

Privacy from your ISP is a big one. Want to download torrents and not have a knock at the door, you need a VPN. Crypto exchanges are another big one, many people from the US use Bitmex, but you can do it from a US IP address. Anything illegal, or even that which is deemed politically unacceptable, carries a risk that it could be used against you later when not keeping your internet travels invisible. And as millenials/gen z start to get jobs, they are more likely to spend money down this road because they grew up with the internet and see these problems for what they are.

Conversely, each and every time one of those incidents comes to mind, to consciousness, you can treat it as a learning experience. Be objective: "hmmm what did I do wrong there?". Be pleased that you have yet another opportunity to improve yourself. Each time you do this, you start to first develop the mindset that it the long term change in yourself that is important; some call that the growth mindset. And the more you develop this mindset, the less you be bothered about each incident. And as a bonus, you use the power of your mind, the instinctual way it integrates unconscious experience and changes how you react to these situations (social in this case). AKA, you screw up less. And as soon as you realize that the stream of incidents is drying up, you notice that your already become a confident man. Everyone makes assumptions based off of what society informs them is the norm and what they personally experience.

She gets angry and tells me how it doesn't taste like any salmon she ever had and that she had had salmon many times and that what I served her wasn't salmon. After getting more and more angry about not having salmon she looks me dead in the eyes and says "this tastes like turtle" I honestly didn't know how to react so I just asked if she was sure and she says "yes, I actually like it. But it isn't salmon"

It depends a lot on your personal situation, and what you value. 
The upper of a good walking shoe will be sturdier than that of a regular shoe, but more flexible than that of a running shoe. One reason not to do a walking routine in running shoes is that the traction of the latter is so deep it can make you jam your feet (causing toe injuries) and even stumble while walking. Take into account the thickness of the sock you expect to wear while walking (and you should wear thick, absorbent socks). It is best to bring the socks along and put them on when you are trying on walking shoes. This way, you won't have to guess at how much room to leave for the socks. Also remember that your feet will probably swell as you walk. They can also help your feet to stay cooler, drier, and more comfortable as you walk. Make sure that the heel "collar" (the part above the heel counter) is firm fitting but well padded to prevent blisters and that the insole under the heel is well padded. So no matter what type of shoes you wear or activity you do, if you exercise regularly, it's a good idea to buy new athletic shoes every four to six months or whenever the tread wears down.

It the context of your actions, and other actions that lead to those, that defines you as morally reprehensible or not. And its always more complex than simply saying "that was bad", even if it was really bad. But the fact that it complex desn make it good, either.

One of the main difference between me and lets say one of the next few best german players is that i have memorized a lot more opening knowledge. But that only gets me to the point where we both don "know" the position any more in a better way. After that my midgame and endgame has still to do a lot and there the main difference is that I have more experience / know more patterns and have a better evaluation for the patterns. Many of the standard things they know as well, so often they make as good moves as I do and sometimes they beat me because the game just happens to have those patterns that they know and are able to evaluate correctly. In other games my experience lets me evaluate the patterns much better and after the games I can really explain very well why, I just have "experience".

Audiences don realize how much of the voice actor performance is actually crafted during post production. With recorded dialogue and narration you are quite often crafting what seems to be a consistent level of quality or characterization or intensity or even meaning by "Frankensteining" completely different performance lines together into single paragraphs of dialogue. You often even just replacing parts of sentences or single words or taking out pauses (or adding them), or even altering vocal pitches via speed modulation, to create different sorts of emphasis.
Regarding what someone said that you can also buy them from some websites, yes it's true but there are some pros and cons to this. For instance on the Pro side, you get chips a lot more cheaper than you would get them from in the game. On the Con side, most websites do not deliver in proper time. 
Now, player A is going to have the best hand on a lot of flops, but an ace will come off only one time in six. Any other time, if player A bets, he's going to have nothing but ace high or something like bottom pair/a gutshot. Player A will be forced to often bet with a very weak hand that can't stand a raise, or give up the pot to the big blind, who will usually bet if checked to after the flop.

The fact is things are not fair, and they will never be because women and men are different. We can live in a world where companies only hire men when there are jobs for women to fill, that just wrong.

The main disadvantage you'll tend to find is that because there is no real money at risk, people generally play a lot looser than they would at a real money table. Some players will call every hand down to the river (last community card dealt in holdem), with hands that most good players would fold without question in a real money game.

, which allows poker rooms and other locations to host charity poker games seven days a week as long as no more than four charities hold events at the same location at the same time. The bill also would increase the daily limit for chip sales per charity from $15,000 to $20,000, with the ability to go as high as $50,000 if charities furnish and run the games themselves instead of hiring a licensed supplier. Bill sponsor Sen. Rick Jones (R Grand Ledge) said he got calls from charities from all over Michigan who asked for a solution that protects their source of fundraising. Those charities are now focusing on convincing members of the House to do the same. "The profitability of the events will be maintained with Sen. Jones' bill while also providing increased oversight that the gaming control board has been saying that they need," said Jean Kordenbrock, manager of the Michigan Charitable Gaming Association. Rick Kalm, executive director of the gaming control board, said he wasn't asked to provide input on Jones' bill, and he hasn't analyzed its potential regulatory impact.

Around 6 months ago Vandy asked me about merging here and RedditVN. I asked him some basic questions and happy with his answers added him as a mod. I liked where he wanted to take the subreddit and he has pretty much free rein to take the subreddit forward.

I still support Vandy as a mod and see no reason to change any current decision made (Kinda, I personally have no issue with Vietnamese language posts as long as we have a mod like Vandy who is fluent in the language)

And these things often do take years, so it's hard to know what will emerge.

He says "I sorry" no if or buts and he sounds genuine when he does it, if it a small issue it ends there, if it a bigger issue then he usually briefly outline a plan for avoiding whatever situation occured in the future. I apologize in exactly the same way. We both prefer to keep apologies brief, sincere and, and if the situation needs to be discussed at length at all, it is only in the context of what the "guilty" party intends to do better from then on and what we both as a couple can do to better avoid hurting each other. I really, really like how we resolve conflicts and move on from them and that makes having hard conversations much easier. We been together 4 years if that makes a difference.

Sorry about my shitty scribbling, I don't have a stylus  but I tried to draw a white marble little tray sort of thing, maybe a nice looking diffuser that will match whatever else you have in the room nicely and shop for planters you like for the space before you get a plant so you can base what you'd pick around the piece! Also zero clue on what sort of art would fit the rest of the room or your taste so just added what could be a nice layout. I think two large vertical pieces in nice frames would look great too though..

To get past the bouncer it totally fine to speak English, just be polite. You can be too drunk or visibly out of it: they want people who are there to dance, not people who are there to get wrecked and cause trouble. Know the line up for the night: one of, if not the first phrase out of your mouth should be "We here to see ________" and often the bouncer asks this too. Wear dark casual clothes with no logos: I wear a black t shirt, black jeans rolled up a bit, and sneakers. Plain jacket   a bomber or something simple, ideally. No crazy jewelry, no collared shirts. Dress like you went to Central Saint Martins, or the Manchester version of that, haha.

It often said that a man home is his castle. However, that old saying takes extra special meaning when describing the colossal mansions and fabled castles of America, some of which can occupy more than a city block or even an entire neighborhood. While a few of the most famous American castles are merely theme park attractions, such as Busch Gardens DarKastle, Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle and Universal Hogwarts Castle, there are far many others that can mystify and entertain visitors and their children just as easily, yet offer a more realistic look on the history behind it and the extraordinary people who helped build them. The following are five of finest castles in America to explore for that next big vacation.

Seriously? Losing weight is one of the most basic things in the world. Cut your calories. That literally it. If you eat fewer calories than you normally do then you will lose weight. Making friends and human connections is one of the greatest struggles humans have. Loneliness is one of the biggest issues in modern society because it hard to forge connections with people. It not hard to lose weight. The biggest barrier there is will power. Losing or gaining weight is mechanical function. It all about how many calories you taking in. What you do is stop eating as much food as you used to. You take in fewer calories than you expend and boom, you lose weight. Of course its easier than finding people and making a real connection with them. Even in it extreme form, starving yourself is incredibly easy.

Here another in this series of fabulous color in 1930 and mid 1940 designs, and the third from the Armstrong Cork Company and their sales pamphlets for their linoleum flooring (Better Floors for Better Business, printed in Lancaster, Pa.).

It is hard to think of Sidney Greenstreet gliding across a room or through a restaurant that is bathed in nothing but shades of gray, when in fact he could been wearing a brilliant plum colored suit and moving across a flaming red floor. And in this case, with Armstrong, they did indeed make flaming red flooring and in stark contrasts with yellows and blue designs.

The problem is, the majority of the pots in an average 1/2 NLHE game are under 40.00.

It took about 11 days to arrive from China, which is pretty quick for AliExpress.

A childish "that's so bad it couldn't have happened," becomes mixed with a slight racial angle "they would say that about good German people wouldn't they?"

A final note: in prose and poetry the Latin word "Quantum" has been mixed up with the word "Quintum" time and time again; Quintum means "a fifth" of something and has also been used as a measurement (equaling 3.65 grams) in pharmacy.

A co worker of mine, Kevin, committed suicide some years back. Prior to this I had seen him briefly on the street the morning after an all night party I went to. Basically we had a very meaningful exchange in a short period of time. A week later he is dead. On the night of the day he died I was waiting for my train home from work. While waiting I noticed a stationary glowing green bar of light high up on the wall. I looked around thinking somebody was projecting this glowing green bar of light. No one was around. At that point the light went shooting down the train tunnel. The light was glowstick green and bright. I felt at the time it was Kevin saying hello and goodbye. This is the ONLY time I had any personal experience after someone death. I had closer friends die and never experienced a thing aside from dreams about them.
