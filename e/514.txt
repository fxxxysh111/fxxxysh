Does this make a difference with the in person vs tapingo to go issue? Do you think a full tapingo takeover is where we heading? Maybe with the exception of coffee shops where people get super picky?

Cinematically, "Oslo, August 31" looks like a drop of morning dew reflecting a prism of saturated colors. Director Joachim Trier soaks the film with a palette of leafy hues, bold shadows and a revelatory light   and has a tinted shade accompanying specific emotions as a way to evoke the rather muted psychological state of the protagonist, Anders. This subtle underlay of poignant lighting follows Anders, a recovering drug addict, through a simple plot encompassing the duration of a single day..

To the casual passenger, any airport can be a veritable hellmouth. The food sucks, the people who work there are unfriendly due to the soul sucking nature of working at a goddamn airport, the price of a beer makes Rupert Murdoch go, "Whoa." In an environment like this, a single canceled flight can send you screeching head first into madness. So, really, it's no surprise that there are airport themed conspiracy theories. What is surprising, however, is that almost all of them focus on a single place: Denver International Airport. The site is a hotspot for various, usually New World Order themed conspiracy theories that basically paint the place as a thinly veiled front for a massive murder factory fueled by the Illuminati Nazi devil. These are based on its supposedly swastika shaped runway layout ."Hey, Bob, look! There's a where they've vanquished that war demon and everyone lives happily ever after!"

I was trying to get him off of any draw, I didn realize the guy flopped a set of 9 Not sure how often you play but a value raise often steals the pot, especially vs the people I play in this particular live game, which is why the small re raise on the flop. Obviously you do it too much and someone is going to take advantage of you, but if I can steal $200 $300 dollar pots with value bets or raises more often than I get re raised then it a very effective way to make money. The pot on the turn was never for value; I never expected to get called by the guy that called it. 90% sure I was going to take down the pot. If I did get called I assumed I was probably beat and going to have to get extremely lucky on the river, but it turns out I did actually have outs vs his hand, the gutty straight and flush draws. I did get lucky, just not in the way I thought I would.

The first thing you should do before planning a home poker tournament is to check the laws in your area. Each state and in some places, even the county you live in have laws regarding gambling. In most cases the laws restrict anyone from making a profit from the tournament. This means you can't charge an extra fee for entering the tournament. Any money collected for entering the tournament should be added to the prize pool and distributed to the winners. Your local laws may differ.

Leslie's gift was not alone in the little house.

Anne herself made many, desecrated by no touch of machinery, spending over them the happiest hours of the happy winter.
Since you mention bonobo hunting, I think this is interesting: so the mythology of the Hunter is that women need to protect babies, so they don hunt. This is what we see in chimps   basically, it is risky to hunt colobus with an attached infant, so females stay out of it (although infertile females hunt with the males). This challenges the assumption of male aggression and dominance being required for hunting..

Here's my two cents. I've stuggled with patello femoral pain for the last year, and have reduced the pain to where it is isolated to the region you've described the very top of the patella, and it almost feels like it's the bone itself that is sore. Earlier in the year, the whole inside of the kneecap would hurt because the kneecap was not tracking correctly. This is a very complicated problem to fix, and the physical therapists all have different ideas on the best approach. My first PT had me doing mostly VMO exercises (straight leg lifts, etc.), which I did for nearly three months with ZERO improvement. The exercises that worked (with a subsequent therapist) were those that strengthened the gluteus medius, and the various muscles that help your femur externally rotate. Stengthening the stabilizer muscles of my lower leg also helped keep my ankle, and knee, from collapsing inward.

The fifth and last game found in Pacific Poker is the 7 Card Stud game. It is a game where players have one or more face up cards. It is described as the most played poker in public card rooms. This has three versions that can be played in Pacific Poker. These are High, Low and High Low Split games. In 7 Card Stud Low, the player who obtains the lowest hand wins the pot while one with the highest hand wins in the 7 Card Stud High. In 7 Card Stud High Low Split, if no one among the players qualifies for the low, the entire pot is given to the high hand.

Wouldn't you like to create similar experiences in the comfort of your own home with your friends? Going to a casino or a poker tournament is great, but there is something different about playing with friends. You start to learn their tendencies and use them to your advantage.

It also seems a lot more realistic with a real poker table instead of playing on the kitchen table.

I was at a comic con with a buddy of mine. One day we were walking around the city the con was in looking for a place to eat that wasn't packed with people. As we're walking down the sidewalk this short, drunk dude started to cross the street towards us. We're both average build guys so we don't really pay him any mind. That was until he got up in my buddies face basically looking for a fight. I know my buddy, he's not a patient dude, so I stepped between them and told the dude as politely as I could to fuck off. I knew we could kick his ass, but you never know with drunk people what they're capable of or able to deal with since alcohol can lessen pain. So we started walking away only to have him follow us cussing us out and trying to incite a fight. We left him with no incident, but it got me thinking. That's happened all of two times to me, but being a woman is probably equivalent to having someone try that shit every day. Gotta say, seems like it takes a lot of strength to be a woman.

Dropping in a less contested area near a very contested area is a proven strategy that can help struggling players learn the game and helps them also just get more skilled at aiming in a somewhat safer environment (3rd partying is safer than engaging a fresh team).

The oil and gas industry in Canada is not doing very well at the moment. Western Canada Select Crude is selling at a significant discount because it lacks source to port access. Much of that has to do with interprovincial politics striking down pipeline construction/expansions, and the National Energy Board stifling projects. This is actually a major bone of contention right now between the province of Alberta, and the Federal government/provinces of Quebec and BC. So much so, in fact, that separatist sentiment in Alberta is approaching all time highs. On top of this, Keystone XL (while approved) has been massively delayed because many states are trying to use every judicial trick they can to stall the project. This means Alberta has an ocean of oil that has nowhere to go.

Needless to say, this is wrong. Physics is sufficiently far developed to state that there will never be a way to make a proton or a neutron or any other nucleus simply disappear and convert its entire mass into energy. It is true that there are processes by which various smaller particles positive and negative electrons and mesons are annihilated, but all these phenomena involve at least one particle which does not normally occur in nature and therefore must first be created, and this creation process consumes as much energy as is afterwards liberated.

While the aluminum case is as professional as can be, there are several other benefits to this poker chip set. It offers scratch resistant glass (which we didn't realize initially), the 11.5 gram chips with 39mm diameter, three colors, and designs that look just like they came from some casino in Vegas. Oh, and probably the most interesting part to all this is the case is made from aircraft aluminum.
