Portage doesn offer any day to day benefits, but the day to day is going to be mostly stable for any set of workflows that you have on any system. The question is more whether there are to days that you can never have because you are on certain systems, or that you avoid because it is too much of a pain to get them working on a given distro. Portage gives you significantly more power in controlling exactly what software is and can be installed on your system.

The East has it own problems, but one thing that really sets the West apart is in the West the wound of shame runs extremely deep. The irony is the USA was founded upon both a desire for freedom for everyone and deep seated shame. The Puritans and Calvanists that founded America were people, well intentioned but yet ignorant, who spread the pain of shame. Americans are very uptight and wounded around sexuality. Unless someone was raised in a country outside of the USA, or had extremely powerful/conscious parents, most anyone raised in the USA has sexual shame. As a bodyworker, I see this as tight hips, tight pelvises, tight/painful low backs, weak core muscles. lack of passion for life, addicted to porn or chasing the next sexual gratification experience. Americans, as a population, are impotent and powerless.

If I getting my source correctly, Janda "No Limit Hold for Advanced Players" explains that you should only be theoretically happy getting called when you have AA or KK. 
The laws, too, are a bit of a mixed bag. In high school, you often see that the Romans were an ordered people, having everything just so, and establishing firm constants over the area which they ruled. This, like all generalizations, is a lovely fantasy. Perhaps most importantly, the laws and such depended on the period of Roman history which is being discussed. I can talk about how Western Roman history took place over a literal millenium, but that hard to visualize from the comfort of your couch. So, for perspective, that like saying that the constancy of Rome is like the constancy of Britain after the battle of 1066. There have been a few changes since then, up to and including the fact that we would not understand the English that was spoken at that point in time, just like people in the Late Republic (1st century BCE) were not particularly good at sussing out their own original legal code, which was written about 3 400 years prior (450 449 BCE).

I agree with you on some stands but definitely not all. Ghiacco would get destroyed by the pillar men. They are isanely strong and would easily break his ice. And i ont have to tell you about esdisis. Jotaro would die of the pillar mens ranged attacks. esdisi can shoot his magma and wammu has divine sandstorm. Same goes with kira( though probably not with stray cat and bites the dust). Echoes act three would simply not be strong enough. Kira lifted his hand when it was hit. Oingo and boingo are simply too wird for us to be able to predict an actual outcome of the battle. Highway could have a chance but honestly i dont think it can drain all the nutrients in a pillar man wich i guess is a lot since they suck up entire humans like it was nothing.

The answer to this contradiction not so much in the economic reform debate going on, but in another, more quiet movement for economic justice. Answer is to send some of the Wall Street fat cats to jail for their crimes against the people. Believe it or not, there is some movement afoot to do just that.. 
(Tournament background) If ever I'm check raising the flop and checking turn it's usually when I believe I might have caught up and I don't want the pot to bloat oop. For example, if I'm c/r the flop with nothing I'm doing so because villain is cbetting every flop and he's opening wide usually from late position. So I'm c/r to punish his very wide/weak range. An example would be let's say villain opens the button (wide) you defend j10dd from bb hu to flop. Flop comes 637hhd. I like c/r as a bluff because our goal should be to fold out his high cards (assuming he has a fold button) that have us beat. A,k,q High combos that have us beat(2 over cards have around 24% equity if they get to see turn and river so folding out that type of equity is HUGE). We can turn lots of equity, diamond, 8,9,10,J and most likely giving up on all other cards. Let's say turn is a J. He probably doesn't make any two pair combos that contain a jack. He most likely doesn't play j6,j3,j7. So we can assume that we are most likely ahead of him at the point. We don't want to let this pot get out of control, it might be best to try and get to showdown at this point. Check the turn oop after check raising.
Yeah, claws are fucking scary as hell. Those things are pure destruction. So is the mouth of the dogs mentioned and other big breeds. The pain threshold of a lot of these animals is high. Plenty of people have stories of how their cat swiped at a German Shepherd and the dog went scampering away. I also seen happily bloodied dogos after a boar hunt and its gnarly as fuck. When my 65 pound dog would get into aggressive fights over a pig ear, I don really want to know what it is like with a Turkish Mastiff losing its shit. Cougars aren roaming around getting into fights. They are stealth hunters. They would almost never find themselves in a situation where they are fighting an animal of equal size. A good couple gashes and they are probably winning, but if a mastiff got a hold of that neck and clamped down, that could easily be lights out.

Doug Polk is a scumbag for this, he buddies up with Joey Ingram when Joey said hey I don't really want to do the work but I wouldn't mind getting paid. So Doug was like okay let me find someone who will do the work for you. Than comes along Jnandez does all the work thinking he's going to make a name for himself and get paid for the hard work he's from done. But nope once he does the work Upswing tells him he needs an affiliate who's going to take $250 from every course he sells and than will get his measly 25% while Upswing takes the rest. Than Jnanadez comes up with a great idea in working with the solver, thinking okay finally I did the grunt work on the last course and paid my dues now it's my time to shine. But Doug and Upswing had a different idea increasing his equity by 5% and stil using Joey as an affiliate!!!!! Fuck Upswing, they are the pokerstars of the trading site world. I lost all respect for Doug and Upswing after watching this video and will be moving to RIO. If your reading this Doug than you've lost a fan and a lifelong customer, I hope Upswing crashes and burns after this video makes it around the poker community. Go fuck yourself.

Your real question is a little tougher to answer. 
Those sets of rules, as well as poker secrets, tend to cause a number of these normally outstanding athletes to believe the poker online is rigged. Although Texas Holder must be a game title of talent, every time a personal computer is figuring out your poker hands and wrists, extreme caution should be worked out even if you understand how to perform as an specialist. The reasoning right behind way too many suckouts in online poker and poor beats is because of the poker requirements which control many facets of the video game.

On a septic, remove the clean out cover and observe the water level in the tank, the inlet pipe should be visible and above the water level in the tank. If the baffle is blocked clean it with a light weight wooden tool, just a 1 x 2 with a 45 bevel cut on the end works fine. Baffle clogs are common. If the inlet pipe is submerged the water is not being absorbed due to blockage, bad installation, or drain field / dry well issues. In that event call to have your septic pumped and both the inlet and outlet baffle cleaned. You can located and uncover the clean out covers yourself if you are willing to do it, I advise you to be there when the tank is pumped to make sure both the inlet and outlet baffles are cleaned, to observe the condition of the baffles, and to make sure the pumper doesn break the baffles, if need be provide him with the wooden tool.

Saffo is basing his claims off the much more utopian notions of Ray Kurzweil, who last month predicted that anyone alive in 2040 or 2050 could be immortal.

Don focus on cupping your wrist or anything, its kind of natural. Like look at your palm, now grip like you had your hands in your bowling ball, your wrist should naturally cup. Now pop your wrist directly towards your face holding your grip position, your thumb should shoot out which is what happens at the bottom of the swing. Now since only your finger tips are connected to the ball when you "lift" come through the bottom of bowling ball that is where you put the revolutions on it. Now all this happens so fast its really difficult to focus on a specific part of the release it just takes practice. Honestly right now given your release timing will be off I think the more forgiving your thumb hole is the better, but that just personal opinion. Focus on doing absolutely nothing and let gravity do all the work for you, get your timing right, and start just putting the ball down between 1st and 2nd arrow and let the ball do the work for you.

Now imagine playing a game with multiple unknown players and the rules are set such that if all players act honestly, they all have an equal chance of winning.

People have been saying poker is dead for the better part of a decade now, but it clearly still beatable, and some people are still making lots of money. On the one hand, there is still room to beat this game if you good; on the other hand, the games at all limits have been getting harder and harder to beat, people are losing less and less, fish are increasingly scarce, and it is easily conceivable that we could reach a point in the fairly near future where only a small percentage of the best winning players could actually beat the rake. And this is still ignoring the fears that GTO bots could eventually just completely destroy the game.

Preeclampsia   Preeclampsia, also called pregnancy induced hypertension or PIH, is persistent high blood pressure with protein in the urine that develops after 20 weeks of gestation and returns to normal levels after childbirth. The most common sign is widespread edema. If left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to damaged retinal and/or renal blood vessels, as well as compromised fetal blood flow, liver abnormalities, and bleeding disorders. Preeclampsia occurs in 5% to 8% of all pregnancies. This condition is more common in first pregnancies, many prior pregnancies, and young or advanced maternal age. It is also more common in women who are pregnant with multiple babies. Eclampsia is a severe form of preeclampsia that involves convulsions or seizures.

When my 65 pound dog would get into aggressive fights over a pig ear, I don really want to know what it is like with a Turkish Mastiff losing its shit. Cougars aren roaming around getting into fights. They are stealth hunters. They would almost never find themselves in a situation where they are fighting an animal of equal size. A good couple gashes and they are probably winning, but if a mastiff got a hold of that neck and clamped down, that could easily be lights out.

However, Smith believes that the fight was level after six rounds, and that he won the 11th and 12th rounds. Smith also thinks that the 10th round was a tossup round that could have gone either way. I really not surprised that Smith thinks the fight was close, because he also thinks he won the first Abraham Smith fight last year, and I saw that as another clear win for Abraham.

This month, a committee in the House of Representatives, led by prominent congressman Jason Chaffetz (R Utah), held a hearing about online gaming. He argued that online gaming is dangerous and could turn every smartphone into a casino. He also made the case that computer savvy players will find ways to bypass software that prevents players from states where online poker is illegal from playing on sites in states where it is legal. He brought up a similar argument that the software cannot guarantee underage players won't be able to play.

Is there a limit to the "all in" attitude for Texas Hold'Em tournaments being watched by the public? With retail sales, record ratings for television and cable plus big business pouring millions into it, the trend is still clearly reflecting the upswing. And if state legislation moves in favor of regulation of the online gambling industry for the tax revenue, it might not go away anytime soon. Because no one sits down at a table looking to bust out early, they sit down to win.

Chemical peels have become increasingly popular through the years, with most patients undergoing the procedure to treat the face   particularly the areas around the eyes, forehead and mouth. There are different levels of chemical peels that use different agents that vary from light to deep, but they all involve spreading a chemical solution on the skin, allowing it to blister, and then peeling that skin away to unleash the new skin underneath. The benefit? Smoother skin with fewer wrinkles. Read on for some of the benefits of chemical peels, as well as what you need to know before and after the procedure.

Bile however is extremely damaging to large intestine epithelium.When bile enters the small intestine via the common bile duct, beneficial bacteria break the bile salts down into a less toxic compound, making it non dangerous by the time it reaches the large intestine.When you take antibiotics you destroy these bacteria and the bile salts freely enter and damage the large intestine. I believe this contributes significantly to the high incidence of colon cancer plaguing today society.Beneficial bacteria also break down hormone secretions that are discharged from the liver to the small intestine.

Does that mean science accepts pigs can fly? Only sort of, because the hypothesis 'pigs can't fly' is scientific2. It can be falsified by having a pig fly.

The pitch Accessible, affordable massage therapy. That is the concept behind Halifax based Massage Addict, the latest venture for Lori MacKenzie, owner and president of the company. She hit on the idea when she injured her back a few years ago. was seeing a massage therapist a couple of times a month and it became very expensive. I remember thinking, surely if the therapist knew I was coming in for treatments so often they could afford to charge me less. A commitment to regular visits at a discounted rate is proving to be an attractive differentiator for the membership based clinic. Becoming a member at Message Addict requires clients to commit to one treatment a month at a cost of $59 a treatment, significantly less than $70 to $90 fees being charged by Massage Addict competitors, Ms. MacKenzie says. Depending on the clinic, there are anywhere from 13 to 15 therapists on site. easy to get appointments, even same day appointments, she notes.
If you are worried your DH is in the FOG, it worth remembering that the Fear, Obligation and Guilt that the FOG refers to is itself an abusive technique. As such you may have your best success by looking for a couple counselor with a background in abusive childhoods. Also since you talking about wanting to get your DH out of the FOG, it worth asking whether you be willing to consider a male counselor for your couples counseling. Whatever the reasons for it, it hard to deny that in US culture, men are often dismissive of women and their perspectives. Having a male counselor supporting your complaints may be more effective at getting through to your DH than having a female counselor doing the same thing.

A combination of mild temperatures and relatively dry road surface has to be in place in order for the operation to be carried out successfully. 
Please put the subject as "I Love GaGa". Also, this list uses the term "iTunes" to represent digital stores. Yet it most likely possible anything on "iTunes" can be found on Vinyl/CD for higher quality. However the Walmart soundcheck most likely can only be found through Walmarts mp3 site. In addition, the term "youtube" is used here to mean youtube itself, but also "the internet." Last, these songs are listed in no particular order. 
The reason I (dubiously) claim that most fall between those two poles but more certainly claim that some did has a lot to do with my understanding of the plurality of audience.

You can make weight loss expensive if you want to and have the means to but it always cheaper to eat a little bit less. Get a small fry or a small frappe instead of larges. Do little things that don really inconvenience you and changes will happen.

Jim maximized his talent with MMJ. Without them, he trying to be a lot of things he not. He not a saxophone player, so he mimed it like Ashley Simpson live. I found that an entire section at the end of "Know Til Know" is simply pressing a single key on a midi keyboard from the MTron pro vst, which is something I wouldn have even done for my own album that no one would even listen to. If you going to use a sample, don use a prestock sample that comes with the program that anyone can download. It just laziness. And now this Tom Petty cover is him jumping the shark once again. If I had to guess, I would guess the guy is on the wrong drugs. Either that, or he just lost his mojo. He done quite a few things that have made me question his musical integrity.
Even if Villain is LAGGY and could have any two cards, we still only have a single pair that is the 4th best overpair. Our hand simply isn THAT great and going for stacks just isn advisable. If he has AdKd/AdQd/KdQd/Ad6d/Ad2d/7d5d/6d7d/6d5d he still got 35% equity on the turn so even against his semibluffs we not exactly in a dominating spot.

Janda was initially trained as a neurologist who later specialized in manual medicine (Muscle and Joint Manipulation) and rehabilitation; he was uniquely qualified to explain the complex nature of chronic pain syndromes in a manner that integrated neurologically based principles with manual techniques.

He also published nearly 200 papers, and served as an advisor to the World Health Organization (WHO), helping to prepare the third WHO report on rehabilitation in 1981 in Geneva.]. 
When dealing with All Clay Poker Chips, there is a chance that you will come in to a term called "Mold". This is really simple to understand.

THAT already happening. Anything discussed within the 10 members of Asean, you can be sure the Chinese embassies in three countries will be informed: Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia   and they know exactly the position of each Asean country.

The internet makes it possible for Turnitin to crack down on most forms of plagiarism, most of all the kinds of plagiarism that involve copying and pasting. It's ironic, because the internet and the computer's copy paste function created a plagiarism boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when computer literacy was low among educators and before Turnitin had taken hold.
They turned it into just another fucking dumb American sitcom with that guy who plays Frodo as the main character. A total cringefest. 
It requires premium gas and fancy high performance tires. It was literally designed for racing originally, and you can still get the John Cooper Works upgrades for that same purpose on today models. 
Oh and in regards to sizing, it's going to be tough without knowing how deep the game is. What worked well for me was 5x+1 for every limper AT LEAST. And then my 3 bet sizing was much more aggressive with the expectation of isolation.

In this ruthless sport, one thing I've learned over three and a half decades of seeing promoters do their thing is that the business of boxing first and foremost serves the best interests of the promoters, not the fighters. Just like any other pro athlete, fighters are treated as commodities. But what makes it worse in boxing is that it lacks a single unified entity to control every aspect of the sport. This is why a couple senators have recently proposed The United States Boxing Commission. Only time will tell if this comes to fruition.

Sizings should be adjusted based on a bunch of factors, including (relative) position, stack sizes, ranges of all plazers, etc. A basic rule (probably too basic) is to increase betsize when the likelihood of playing IP post flop decreases. 0.05/0.10 it will use half pot as RFI size from all positions (except mb SB), he must just be avoiding wide ranges in small pots at uncapped high rake, that be my theory anyway.

They make great gifts for small children and these 100 plastic playing cards should be included when looking for small entertaining things to take along for those long trips.

Ideally, if you have no pets/children to keep one eye on, and don snack/drink/smoke at all while using your computer, then sure you could sit there in VR with a million displays getting all kinds of things done. At least until your face is screaming for some relief. But if you want to do any amount of multitasking between your computer and things happening in the rest of the room, you not going to be removing and replacing the HMD every few minutes, you just going to stay in flat mode because that way less hassle.
