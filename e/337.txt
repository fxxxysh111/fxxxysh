B) I am somewhat aware of History. Fortunately for me, I also equipped with enough critical thinking ability that I might take "History", (having been penned in many instances by way of the current ruling religious leadership of the times) as such, with a grain of salt. Or a Pillar of it, might say poor Lot wife. Were I to have an interest in Jewish history, I not use a current or former National Socialist Worker Party recollection or "official account". So it is that we have a struggle in the collection of "Druidic" history, thanks to the Flavian Romans.

At first it was me and my friends who played, we started with 13 players the first month. We jumped up to high teens within a year, and stayed there for the first 2 3 years. Then the numbers started to drop to low teens (a couple broke up, some moved away, etc). We had all invited everyone we knew.

Hopefully you don't end up short stacked too often (were you really playing correctly) and someone outdrew you on a bad call or two, but when you find yourself short, you MUST be strategizing to double up. The best way to double up is to get heads up with just one other player with a decent hand. Even if you are behind with KQos and get called with A9, you are in the right spot to double up, but not against more than one player. Your poker calculator will always say to fold KQos against a raise, but that's when you go your own way and isolate the raiser. You are mostly trying to avoid being dominated here so I look at QJ, or pocket 8's etc. and feel I am not a huge underdog and may even be slightly favored.

Also are you really actually concerned about how much time your husband is spending playing poker online or is your real concern the sexual nature of the chat that is happening at the poker room site? Have you caught him engaging in this sexual chatting in the chat room or have you just seen other players doing it? If you have caught him chatting like that to other people then sit him down and explain to him that you feel that behaviour is not acceptable for a married man and that you would like for that kind of chatting to cease immediately as you feel it is a form of deception by him. If he does not agree to stop the chatting then he doesn't deserve your worry in the first place.

We figured we could spend some time in Jordan with meals like that!

I like giving them MIU puzzles (from the book Godel Escher Bach). turn MU into MIIIU). It gets younger kids used to the idea that you have to justify your steps with an allowed rule. In the book, the point is that there are some problems you can solve although it seems like it should be solvable, namely turning MI into MU. It drive your 9th graders nuts if you pretend you don know that it impossible. A clever kid may eventually realize that you can do it and may even give you a proof (!) to convince you it can be done. It great!

Consider checking when good cards hit you, if checking is available, either on the flop or on the turn to act casually (checking is not available when someone has a bet that you must call/raise or fold/abandon the pot). Making a reasonable bet, as it goes around the table for everyone to either bet or fold, makes you seem real. Be seen holding good cards at showdown, win or lose, or occasionally turnover your good cards when people suggest they think that you win by bluffing. So, build a reputation of consistently betting good hands to make your opponents believe that you probably have another pretty good hand when you are betting moderately. So, they think that you are logically trying to get as many chips into the pot, out of their stacks as you can. It takes guts to carry out the consistent pattern to set up a few good bluffs, because you could be up against a better hand, but if it's done right it can work pretty often, with luck, and if you stay alert enough to know when to fold to save your stack.

No, the reality is we all suffer and worry, and in most cases "being happy" is only a temporary reprieve, never a state able to be attained or sustained.

He did this voluntarily, despite the fact that he must've known the police had DNA traces of the killer because he was the one who left them there.

When people say "e cig companies are targeting kids", it always seems like what actually happening is that marketing tactics they develop for the general public also happens to attract some kids as a consequence.

Sorry, but not so sure your just not obsessed with he gilded age. Not sure we are there, but giving you the benefit of the doubt that you are legitimately concerned with pay inequality, what do you propose as the solution. I saw a post about someone complaining about the rent in NY being 2400 for a efficiency apartment. That to me seems to be a supply and demand problem more than a pay problem. If that be the case 15.00 an hour isn't going to fix the issue. As for unions, yes they had a purpose in the past. We now have regulations that protect employees more so than what we had in the past. My own experience is that I am making more money that what I ever did at a union position. Beware of who you trust, as Union reps have their own agenda as much as employers do.

Schrijver asserts that Old Irish descends from the hypothetical Lowland British Celtic language that Old English speakers would have been in contact with, and points out that the sound systems of Old Irish and Old English are remarkably similar, through comparison of the processes of u umlaut in Old English and palatalization in Old Irish. As well, Old Irish has parallels to Old English breaking/a umlaut in its system of velarization, a byproduct of palatalization where consonants that are not palatalized are pronounced by bringing the tongue into near contact with the palate. There other correspondences between the two languages such as stress on initial syllables, the loss of unstressed syllables in the middle of words loss or shortening of final unstressed syllables, richer vowel systems in stressed syllables compared to unstressed ones and presence of voiceless fricatives..

My daughter is my fourth child and much healthier than my other three and I am very lax with her when it comes to dirt. She is quite disgusting but I still take her to doctors, get her vaccinated, give her necessary medications. I was on antidepressants through my entire pregnancy with her and while breastfeeding. She was the most chilled baby I had ever seen and I felt super guilty cause I thought I was drugging her but my gynae and paed said that my mental health is also extremely important so I continued with my medication. My kids were also all born a bit premature and thank God for doctors. Giving me the necessary medications to help their little lungs, giving me c sections because the babies didn engage into my pelvis. Who knows if I would have survived child birth if we had no doctors. I had so many people talking bullshit to me my whole life of big pharma and doctors just do csections for money and asthma medication makes you worse and and and but I am so grateful that I can see the benefits and not believe that crap.

The sound that people on stage hear is often very different from what the audience hears   for example the natural reverb of the area might mess up the rhythm, there a weird delay between the audience audio and the stage audio in large venues, and oftentimes you don really hear all the instruments properly and it just a bunch of noise etc. etc.

Pro players argue that poker isn even gambling, because it a game of skill, not chance _ a view supported by a federal judge ruling last year that threw out the conviction of a man charged with running an illegal poker business in the back room of a Staten Island warehouse.

But an appeals court reversed the decision earlier this year, saying the games constituted an illegal business.

Fair enough for trying to justify his selection but this is clutching at straws, even if we pretend that euro tour/floor events don count towards selection and that the World Series is remotely relevant then you can just say that Barney reaching the semi of some random exbo event in Australia has the same weighting as Whitlock reaching a ranked TV major final. Hypothetically speaking should someone reaching the World Championship + World Matchplay finals yet losing in the first round of two world series events count for the same as reaching the final of two world series events but losing in the first round of the World Champs and Matchplay? No of course not, but your scoring system grants those achievements equal weighting..

The hand itself it somewhat interesting. I think I prefer a check back on the flop from OP. OP definitely has all the sets and QQ+, but I think I prefer a check raise with these hands rather than a call (granted, check raising is awkward with his stack size). His opponents also have the sets as well as the straights and two pairs, so he needs to be careful. With KQs in particular, I like check calling (mixing in a check raise every now and then). Your opponents have a lot of hands that will call you on the flop and you really benefit from seeing a turn card.

I will first preface this with a warning. I don use recipes unless I am baking or doing something precise for the first time. I much prefer to learn techniques and apply knowledge and a sense of taste when doing things like seasoning. Part of that is because questions like "how much garlic" or "how long do I cook" depend on things like taste and ingredients. A particularly strong head of garlic would require less than something a little milder, and visual/taste/aroma/sound indicators of doneness provide a much more accurate and flavorful experience. This of course requires some familiarity with cooking.

The previous owner may not have had the right to sell it as paths and roads become public domain after not much time at all.

If the spell is interrupted, the caster reduces his maximum hit points by the amount chosen until the end of a long rest.

Given the length of these wars already, you would think the administration and the military could actually figure out how much they need to spend. Importantly, given that $549BILLION has ALREADY been budgeted for these wars, you would think the administration wouldn have to request billions more in emergency funds  billions that are funded through growing deficits. The emergency? could possibly be unforeseen at this point?.

I found this out when I came home from college to hang out with my brother. We wanted to make up for lost time and spend every minute together, but we ran out of things to talk about pretty quickly.

 3 points  submitted 1 day agoMy favorite character is Jon, and this is the season where he starts really rising up. I have never enjoyed a character so much, than I did jon in this season. I loved the whole dynamic between him, Stannis, and Davos. Just everything at the wall was great, and Hardhome was my favorite episode of the series. I also really enjoyed Dorne, although most people dont. It does feel very tonally different from the rest of the show, and my first time watching it I was quite jarred and lost but on rewatch, I really enjoyed it. I liked seeing jaime struggle with his hand and having to talk his way out of things instead of fight, I liked Tiene Sand and her mother, I thought the whole situation with the prince being super peaceful and good was interesting. I really dissapointed they just threw all of that away in season 7. Kings landing this season was the last time I really enjoyed it. I despised it in season 6, and it rarely shows in 7. I havent seen the show in a few months so I dont remember everything, but I do know that this season is the one I just could not put down and was absolutely obsessed with watching, even more so than the rest. Oh and this was my favorite season of Winterfell, with Ramsay and Reek and Sansa, well I love any scene with ramsay but still. The only complaints I can really think of is the bullshit with Stannis burning shireen, and the lack of Tyrion and Varys scenes.

Chinese is a game is played with four players but can be played three handed or heads up. Each player is dealt 13 cards from a standard 52 card deck. Players must arrange their cards into three poker hands: the front (three cards), the middle (five cards), and the back (five cards). The back five cards must be the strongest hand of the three, the middle five must be second strongest, and the front three must be the weakest. Another way to play is to have the middle hand be played with a deuce to seven lowball hand (with the best hand being 7, 5, 4, 3, 2). Once arranged, the cards are then placed face down on the table until all players have set their hands. Players turn the cards face up, and the money is awarded in terms of "points".

I wonder if the bit about the seventh episode is more suitable for the Radio Ga Ga section (great header, by the way )   you don't want to go into any more technical detail in the introduction, but I seee the reason it was the seventh episode is because the series was six episodes long.

This statement directly indicates that either Gaetz intends to ask Cohen about his marital infidelities at the hearing, or has knowledge of fellow Congressmen who intend the same. The logical implication is that if Michael Cohen declined to testify or otherwise appear for the hearing, he would not be asked about his marital infidelities. In this case, a reasonable recipient would interpret it as a threat.

That map obviously isn even close in size to what you expect from a space game with (presumably) multiple planets.

So, we can assume that we going to get multiple smaller areas or one big area as usual.

But most of the legitimate defenders of socialism in Venezuela (and I am not one) would agree that Maduro is awful.

However, I would not trust the a CIA or US military sponsored coup to be in my best interests. Probably, things would get better in the short term, but in the long term I be worried about a puppet state that funneled oil to big multinationals and set up a pro American de facto dictatorship.

To be sure, current theory can explain some success stories   like the ascendance of Google owing to its secret search algorithm but it could hardly predict the rise of KB Home.

Kevin Plank, a college football player, entered the market for athletic wear in 1995, when it was dominated by giants like Nike and Adidas. Working in his grandmother's basement, he fabricated underwear from a synthetic fiber. It was light and moisture wicking, but the yarn was widely available, making the concept easy to imitate. Yet the initial lack of proprietary materials, technology or brand name somehow did not stop UnderArmour from growing. Competitors were slow to catch on to the idea, and Plank became the youngest entrant to the Forbes list of billionaires, growing the start up into a multibillion dollar behemoth.

In Italy our house was bereft of amenities, mom walked to the communal water fountain where she would fill a large cistern to carry back. Laundry was done in the creek, heat was from a fireplace that also served as the cooking area for making meals. The house, which was mom's dowry when she married dad, consisted of two rooms lit by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. It also had an area where sausages could be seen hanging along with cured hams and a suspended shelf covered with loaves of bread. Every now and then a chicken would get into the house and at night I'd hear it squawking trying to get out. What I loved most though was the fish market, where shelves and containers of shiny fish would sparkle in the sunlight, black eels moved around in metal pails and snails tried to crawl out of the basins holding them.

Such high rakes are far beyond the reach of a common man. This is just not it, The opportunity costs incurred with respect to a traditional poker room are in fact much higher than even the already very high rakes.

I don't think TH is alive. I have suspicions that her family might have known she was dead before 11/3 and that's why they have acted strangely at times. I theorize they were told by LE that SA did it but they needed a legal search warrant to enter his property, so they had to pretend this was a missing person's case so that she could be reported "missing" and they could have a civilian search party find the RAV. It was all a LE set up to get a warrant for ASY and frame SA, but the family naively believed they were doing the right thing to help get a warrant to catch who they really believed was the killer.

Avoiding romance in the US at this point in time is a bit like avoiding taxes. government grants us rights and privileges based on marital status (over a 1,000 of them).

I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, yes, Bueller is an asshole who has no concerns about anyone else feelings or needs. But he exists as a plot device, a foil to the world around him. Everyone else in the movie is interested in following rules because they are the rules, not the purpose that those rules are actually supposed to serve. You go to work because that what you supposed to do. You go to school because that is what you supposed to do. While his refusal to follow any rules, or to acknowledge the point of said rules does move him firmly into the realm of he there to point out the absurdity of the people around him. I mean, if I actually knew someone like that, I think that person needed to be medicated or arrested. I find it easier to think of him as an idea than a character.

He is easy to love, affectionate, and friendly. He is moody and unpredictable. Vulnerable, sweet, devoted to family. Impulsive, strong, and overflowing with emotion. Dreaming of home, always. Never quite at home, anywhere. This is Connor, a puzzle his family and caregivers have worked long and hard to solve, a boy who lives at the intersection of autism and mental illness. It isn so much a rare place as many as half of autistic children suffer from mental health problems but it can be a deeply baffling one. The overlap between these afflictions is hard to untangle; diagnosis and treatment can be very difficult. And a health care system meant to help can instead be frustrating, even harsh.

The convenience of online gambling is making it a hit. 
The casino would much rather have tables full of these players, they play bigger pots and in turn pay more rake. When the table is full of them they also have a much better chance of winning against other players which means more money in the pockets of the people most likely to give it back to the casino.

Poker is such a beautiful game because it has that mix of luck, skill and psychological mind reading to it. You truly never know what's gonna happen to a game.

When reviewing the testimonials, it is important to ensure that you look to see what they have to say about the quality of the products that they purchased, the prices compared to other websites, and the level of customer service that they experienced..

Keep in mind that you should raise more vs. small bets than you should vs. big bets. For example, ATs is a high frequency raise facing a 1/3 PSB on T72r, but is far less likely to be raised vs. a 100% PSB on the same board. As bet size decreases, the betting range becomes more merged, and therefore you can raise wider for value. That also means you raise more as a bluff because you have more value combos.

The odds of any card pulled from an ordinary deck of 52 cards being an Ace is 4 in 52 (4 aces in a deck of 52).

A more interesting question would be "what would the probability be of ANY of those 13 cards being an Ace?" Any takers? (Full Answer).

Each game extracts the same wager and it's easy to see how a player can win while losing: two "wins" doesn't compensate for eight losses. However, the player's perception is one of success.

So if you can hook up with mods in a default or a large sub, you'll get a reaction sooner as there will be multiple reports with differing triage tickets. Hope that helps some!
