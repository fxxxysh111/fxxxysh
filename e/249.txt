No, I do not realize what is going on in the States; I do not live there. Which is beside the point. I know that many people in many countries are neglectful in that regard, about which I am sad, and that many governments around the world try to eliminate that neglect, for which I am grateful. I am also aware that vaccines do wear off and require multiple administrations over years in order to take hold, which is all the more reason to be ever more vigilant, as they are the only weapon we have against many diseases.
Now you definitely made a mistake on the flop you can never flat in this situation because there are wayyyy too many cards that fuck you on the turn and your opponent is showing you he strong by raising like he did. Either he has an incredible draw or he has 2 pair+ . If he has 2 pair+ (like he did) and you call and the draw hits the turn then you lose his whole stack (what happened) and if the draw doesn hit or worse if it pairs the board maybe he gets cautious on turn and check folds to all in. You have to jam flop here every single time.

First it started with me having to wear it back at all times in a ponytail and a headband and eventually ended with them taking me to the salon to have it all cut off.

That great feedback. And you are very correct. But there is a lot of room for discussion. Today a large ground war against the US would be very foolish. There is not a single military adviser who would go toe to toe. It would almost resort to guerilla style tactics and insurgency, nothing really new here. The only difference is that we arent fighting through korea, or through vietnam, etc. We will know where the banks are, the critical infrastructure. Most of china military relies on rail road to relocate through out the country. Easy for drones to stop all that. China would have trouble paying and even feeding it troops. The Chinese military isn loyal to the country or the people, it is loyal to the communist parry. The US can pay better and we have way better food.

This isn't black jack where the rules always statistically work. 
Poker is not a single game with a single set of rules, but a classification of games sharing similar characteristics. These basic characteristics are played as follows:An ante, or initial bet, is thrown into the pot to serve as incentive to play. Other players may match your bet ('call'), increase the amount ('raise'), or remove themselves from investing further ('fold'). This is repeated until all but one player has folded or all of the cards (for the specific game) have been drawn or shown, at which point the hands are revealed and the strongest hand wins.

Second, your premise for this not being attainable is a situation with repeated unexpected expenses? Yes, if you ONLY saved that money, had no insurance or other means of support, AND had repeated events like broken bones then maybe you might come up short. But that like saying "Well if he couldn come up with 800 in that year he had to pay for chemo and his house burned down and he got deported, so most people probably couldn do it either." Doesn make a lot of practical sense..

Another fact is that the traditional poker rooms are not really much in favor of offering poker gaming as it does not benefit then or fetch the same amount of profits like the other games do. In the case of online gaming, the aim is to provide a good gaming experience to the players rather than the conventional objective of profit maximization. The time charge as charged by the traditional poker rooms are often very highly quoted. Such high rakes are far beyond the reach of a common man. This is just not it, The opportunity costs incurred with respect to a traditional poker room are in fact much higher than even the already very high rakes. The traditional gaming rooms have devised a new way of profit maximization which is to remove all the poker rooms and in stead of them go on to add more and more slot machines which are ultimately likely to yield more profit than poker rooms do.

During your workout, give yourself some time to take breaks so you can let the lactic acid build up go away. It's not advisable to train so hard on a daily basis because you risk muscle wear and tear and even overuse. 
While it may be something of a sweeping statement, I did put the parenthesis addition there for groups it may not apply to   but more often than not it seems people have just expanded on the draw 2 with advantage by adding rolling cards to the equation. 
 1 point  submitted 3 days agoEvery single triathlon I have ever done, there has been a moment during the swim, when I have panicked and thought am not going to make it There is something about swimming in a pack of people when you might accidentally get kicked in the face and in open water where there are waves which you may or may not try to swallow when they crash over you.Relax take a deep breath move out a little to the side of the pack where there are fewer people, and focus on taking long smooth strokes like you do in the pool.I have always found this to help. 
You dodged a bullet. In 7 years your ex will be married with 2 kids to some banking asshole who most likely cheats on her with 19 year old strippers named Krystal and she will be stuck with him because that's the life she knows and her mother won't allow her to divorce. And in 7 years when you are successful and making your first millions, engaged to an exotic PhD candidate you will run into her and her bratty kids and you will smile and nod and walk on.

In an environment like this, a single canceled flight can send you screeching head first into madness. So, really, it's no surprise that there are airport themed conspiracy theories.

Offbeat observation: The drink I really want is the Indian Sidecar, which has drawn a lot of attention even though nobody has ordered one since the casino opened. Probably because it costs $25,000. (My Globe laptop would electrocute me if I tried to put that on an expense report.) The drink is mixed with 118 year old cognac and comes with a new Indian motorcycle, a brand originally produced in Springfield. The gleaming bike is on display in the Commonwealth Bar and Lounge on the gambling floor, where the cocktail is on the menu. They ship the motorcycle to your house, apparently; you don get to fire it up and roar out of the casino, which would be much cooler. (Did I get paid to stay up all night partying? Nope. Went to bed early and set an alarm. Sad!)

Though stake is not a concretely defined word the most common use of the word is in "table stakes rules". In this case the "stake" a player has in the game is the amount of money with which they started the deal.

They don't need to put additional money on the table, indeed they aren't allowed to put more money on the table. Only in between deals may a player contribute more money to their stack. (Full Answer)

 1 point  submitted 9 days agoI realize that, I was simply responding to the statement that "gems don inherently make their respective stats good"   they do, to the extent that there is a payoff to obtaining a specific amount of the attribute required to use the gem.I actually kind of think that all three attributes maybe ought to go back to just being solely for gem and gear requirements, and the bonuses they currently provide could just be moved off to other nodes on the tree. There might be some better plan than that, but it would make the situation for attributes alone balanced at least.

But what if every player is a liar? Is there any way to be sure?

Think about it this way. Each gear in this problem has a different perimeter. For each degree of rotation you traverse 1/360th of the gears perimeter. With two gears touching like in this problem, they will all spin with the same perimeter velocity, but with different rotational velocity. So, if they were touching the ground like tires, they would both go the same distance even though one would be completing twice as many full revolutions as the other. Think a bike with training wheels, both the a training wheel and a bike tire with a rock in the tread. The rock in the training wheel will hit the ground several more times than the rock in the bike tire, even though they are traversing the same distance across the ground.

In regards to this hand, look at the board and the line you took, including your action preflop and on the flop. Ignoring the fact that you never have Aces or Kings here, since you should be 4 betting those, you didn't bet flop when checked to. If you somehow had a set, don't you think you would've put in a small value bet when he checks to you? In addition, the turn isn't a scare card whatsoever.

If you are talking about the Toyota engine that exhausts on the left as K does, then I believe it is because the K series weighs 72kgs dry and about 78kgs wet. The Toyota weighs in about 140kgs. The same issue arises nominally with other engines (Ford, Honda, Vx etc) in a range of about 120 140kgs. Most people try to remove weight from cars and that takes ingenuity and sometimes It's not usual to want to proceed the other way around! Hence why a certain engineer not too far from me has taken the approach of K series retention being the way to go even if there are hiccups to get there to a reliable spec.

One other issue that kept coming up during therapy was his binge drinking with friends and he started doing this a lot less during therapy. But every once in a while, I catch him in a lie   twice about the poker and once about him hanging out with his womanizing friend   and each time, I get SUPER upset, but I don't know if I am overreacting because of his history of lying and also because I think honesty is REALLY important and I know that not everyone feels that way. DH lies because he hates conflict he would rather try to get away with something than try to talk things through with me (he hates these conversations). And he is not the only person I know who does this. What also doesn't help is that his closest married friends (who also have babies btw) lie to THEIR wives, one about going out with friends (he says he's with coworkers or clients), the other about sports gambling losses. I think DH (dear husband) thinks it's normal and okay to lie some of the time to your wife.

Your hands aren't lethal weapons, but avoid experimenting with new massage techniques if your partner has an existing medical condition that should be left to the care of a trained massage therapist.

He also overfolds in spots and misses a TON of bluffing opportunities especially given his image.

I agree that this is what the user is doing. I disagree that any of this should be demeaning to the average law abiding citizen regardless of their race.

As The Hidden World opens, the young Viking chieftain (and protagonist of How to Train Your Dragon and How to Train Your Dragon 2) Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is leading a raid on the seafaring ships of dragon catchers   men who capture the beasts for economic gain. After freeing a group of imprisoned creatures, the heroes return home to a village that has become overcrowded by men and monsters. Hiccup, seeking a solution to the overpopulation problem, investigates hints found in notes left behind by his father that indicate the existence of a "hidden world" inhabited by dragons. The need to find a refuge becomes paramount when the dragon catchers hire the nefarious Grimmel the Dragon Killer (F. Murray Abraham) to kidnap Toothless, Hiccup's black Night Fury. Grimmel is more interested in killing Toothless than making him a captive but agrees to the terms and uses a newly discovered female white Night Fury as bait.

Postflop: Player A bets $30. Minimum raise for player B is now $60 (in some sense, player A was "raising" a zero dollar bet by $30, so player B must do at least the same.) if player B raises to $60, the next player, whether it is Player A or player c, would be allowed to raise to as little as$90 if they elect to raise.

Everyday circumstances can restrict blood flow: when feet get cold outdoors or in cold water; when shoes, stockings, or undergarments are too tight; even when you've sat too long with your legs crossed. Smoking reduces circulation to all parts of the body, as does drinking too much coffee or caffeinated soda (both nicotine and caffeine constrict blood vessels). And if you are under severe stress, your nerves can constrict your small blood vessels, lessening their ability to carry blood. Some nervous brides and grooms really do have "cold feet"!
