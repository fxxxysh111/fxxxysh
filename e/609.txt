Euclidean domains are always UFDs, and so this is a "fast" way to justify that Z and Z[i] have unique prime factorization..

Bellamy original version was non secular, and, just like the Constitution2 and all of its Amendments, did not mention the word "God". The Declaration of Independence uses the word once, in the phrase "Nature God".) This does not mean that the Founding Fathers were a religious hardly so. All it means is that they sought to differentiate religion and government, and to form a government separated from religious practice and observation, and to ensure that there was no preference to any particular religious sect. On the other hand the Framers provided security for the practice of religion, any religion, by any person, in a very elegant and succinct statement:"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" in the First Amendment, Bill of Rights. The concept is given further freedoms by the fact that "religion" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution. (98 US 145 [1878]) which said that making religious rule or law superior to civil law would encourage everything and nothing, making each person a "law unto himself", meaning that there would be all law and no law, with government having no say in the matter3.

If the showrunner is hellbent on making the cast diverse for the sake of diversity (the aforementioned "political bias"), then the casting process adds unnecessary steps: Character described as white by source material  > Showrunner wants diversity  > Open a casting call for white actors and non white actors alike  > Cast best actor out of this "more diverse" bunch  > Try to explain away the importance of ethnicity  > Call fans racists or bigots. It obviously not about faithfulness to the source material. It isn even about "finding the best actor." Their values are applied selectively so long as it supports their biases. In this case, their bias is for "diversity." They will, therefore, shift their values in order to be able to justify their biased casting.

This means the games outcomes depend solely on the players' skills. Additionally, if you think that something is wrong, you can always contact the regulating bodies and ask assistance from them in solving your issue with the poker room.

The term "dashboard" didn't originate with traffic jams that made drivers want to dash their head against something hard in the hopes of losing consciousness, but instead was passed down to us from the horse and buggy days.

Today, as I visit the Science Museum I was interested to discover a letter from the Royal Archives, written in 1843 to my great great grandfather Prince Albert. Charles Babbage, credited as the world's first computer pioneer, designed the "Difference Engine", of which Prince Albert had the opportunity to see a prototype in July 1843. In the letter, Babbage told Queen Victoria and Prince Albert about his invention the "Analytical Engine" upon which the first computer programmes were created by Ada Lovelace, a daughter of Lord Byron. Today, I had the pleasure of learning about children's computer coding initiatives and it seems fitting to me that I publish this Instagram post, at the Science Museum which has long championed technology, innovation and inspired the next generation of inventors.

That one bad situation, but the other one is worse: when the 15 and 16 teams out of the 16 team pool face each other in the first round, and then one of them wins, and proceeds to draw a team seeded like 12 14, wins again, and now is 2 0 with 3 chances to go thru on the backs of 2 nearly meaningless victories.

And the damn ER bill for essentially no treatment. And this is all when they decide to treat me at all, given how eventually each doctor wants to cut me down to tylenol and acupuncture because I'm "too young to be treated for this much pain." Or they want me to do physical therapy again (even though they tell me they don't feel comfortable treating me since they don't know enough about my condition) after I tell them about how that went for me last time (irreparable neurological damage that lost me use of some pretty important bodily functions and severely damaged my organs as a result). It's so fucking apparent I know more about my condition and the possible treatments than every "specialist" I see, it's gross..

Was a Stones fan first, says Brown. Stones were my gateway to the blues. But I was the kind of kid that when I come across a cover I liked and saw who wrote it, I got to go to the source. When I started going to the source of these Rolling Stones songs I found that I liked Jimmy Reed even more than the Stones and I liked Muddy Waters even more than the Stones. I mean, I love the Stones. But I love the source. That what this is. The album is going to the source. own backstory is certainly colourful enough to fit into the annals of great blues lore.

What makes it more difficult is when someone goes from 0 to 100 like you did earlier, reading way too much into a mod action and accusing us of fetishizing women as the reason. We heard it all, we too pro Korea, too anti Korea, ethnic Korean nationalists, white sexpats, etc, so those comments have lost their meaning and the truth is the accusation about us usually says more about the preconceptions of the person making the complaint than any of us on the mod team. I don know the other mods that closely, but I wouldn categorize any of them as anti Korean and there a variety of nationalities and ethnicities on the mod team, including Korean for both..

About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes   a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.

You did GREAT calling campus police on her. That was her opening shot, and she gave you evidence against her, AND told you her intentions.

Why? Because as much as she's evil, she's not that smart. You are.

With the busy Memorial Day holiday just around the corner, isn it time to start thinking about a well deserved vacation? It should be, especially if that next trip is a beachside destination along the Atlantic Coast. Although many vacationers might prefer quieter beachside communities like Delaware Bethany Beach and even Cape May in New Jersey, even those popular spots can get very crowded and worse yet, can run out of available places to stay. While the following recommendations might not be suitable for every prospective visitor, these destinations offer among the largest range of activities and attractions, as well as the most dining and lodging along the East Coast.

I consider myself a Motown enthusiast, but the label was more about big (or minor, they not that picky) chart toppers than cohesive albums   at least pre Marvin Gaye/Stevie Wonder magic.

The Byzantine Generals Problem may seem like it has no solution and for a long time, it actually didn't.

Take teens perception of risk. It certainly different from that of adults, but not in the ways you'd expect. Research shows, for instance, that teens tend to wildly overestimate certain risks   of things like unprotected sex and drug use   not to lowball them as one would predict. So, it may be that teens notorious risk taking behavior stems not from some immunity to known risks, but rather, as a new study now suggests, from their greater tolerance to uncertainty and ambiguity   that is, unknown risks. Teens, it seems, love the unknown.

In particular, the viscera, or internal organs, are particularly vulnerable early in development.

Yes! It's more likely that the child would have straight hair, but it's all about the genes.

He would find that variable stars in Andromeda were an order of magnitude further away than the greatest dist ant of the furthest star in the Milky Way, and so determined that Andromedia was a galaxy unto itself, and not within our own.

Should I try to be opening more pre flop? I know in normal poker you should rarely limp in but 1/2 NL seems to be a somewhat different game. Most people will chase everything and since you only have 100 blinds to start with, going for big bets pre and post flop increases the variance on the session. For example if I make a 15 dollar bet pre flop with QJ (hardly does anything if you raise for less) and then c bet on the flop missing the board, say a 20 25 dollar bet, then you are almost 1/4 of the max buy in down on your stack and if you don go with the hand you just lose a huge part of your stack.

More seriously: You could try reinforcing the buttonholes and try to make them slightly smaller, so the buttons don slip out so easily. Or you can swap out the buttons. I have a button down from BiuBiu with square ish, flat buttons, and one from Urkye with fairly large, round flat buttons. The shape of those shirts would probably be way too femme for you, but the construction is pretty great, and I have the idea that some thought went into button choices, since they also rather more closely spaced than on regular shirts. Swapping buttons on something isn usually that much work, either, they a lot easier to sew on than those snap fasteners and you can see where the buttons used to be. Just bring the shirt to the shop so you can buy the right size button :)

After dropping hot regularly you start to gain the most important skill imo in any pvp game staying calm under pressure.People I play with that insist on dropping in the middle of nowhere are all the ones who coincidentally display these traits:get caught off guard while looting corpses for 6 eternitieszone out when we say we are moving somewhere and are looting shit we already been through 200m behind usthe last to see enemies or figure out where we are getting shot fromthe ones who don even realize we are fighting people in the same area and are still lootingdon realize which guns are good and which are bad and can only (sort of) aim with the same gun they pick up every roundmost importantly: panic when under pressure.The last one alive taking potshots 150m away when we say rush, down 2 and light up the 3rd. Probably walks straight at them while ADS when they realize they should have rushed.Complain about hot drops with a statement like "I want to win"They are this way because they haven played tons of games where they had to loot a gun and half a magazine of ammo off of their victims 4 times in a row during a multi party gun fight, they haven had to kill 6+ people all trying to kill them at the same time with guns that are bad or they don like, they haven had to race around the area dodging bullets to find a gun when there are 6+ people with guns, and they sure as fuck have never even considered channeling Neo and clutching out 2 kills on gun wielding players with their fists and no armor as being a possibility let alone determine when that is their only option. They aren used to the pressure.Anyone can sneak around and get top 10, top 3, top whatever it is for any BR.

The issue is not about him avoiding taxes legally but doing so illegally. If i undervalue my holdings for tax returns and then overvalue them for loan applications or other business issues i am then guilty of multiple crimes.

The problem here is that we had a series of very small instances of corner cutting in many places. This enabled very small frauds to go unchecked.

And then, of course, there's you. Could you survive in a time where those giant beavers roamed Wisconsin? For that matter, could you survive a night or two if you needed to live off the land? Invest in your own wildness by both consuming less (say it with me: reduce, reuse, recycle), and by learning basic wilderness survival skills. These include starting a fire without relying on a match or learning how to forage   you can forage even if you're a city dweller, and what you consider a weed might be a tasty green you've been missing out on. At first, it didn't really make sense to me; but then a friend who has been practicing for years enlightened me   mindful meditation heightens our natural wisdom, and practicing it can help us become more aware not only of our own self, but also our surroundings. That's a pretty good survival skill to have.

Sports became central to the American higher educational system over a century ago as the real bourgeoisie consolidated power. the rising middle classes were able to translate their growing wealth into political power, they also had to find reasons to justify the fact that they, and not the nobility or upper classes, were the ruling elite. answer was that they were FIT TO RULE  fit in the mental sense, but also the physical one. bourgeoisie painted the upper classes as a bunch of debauched and effete males who could not man up to the job of running Wall St. or DC. working class men were manly, of course, but with degenerate minds and questionable physical fitness. bourgeois men were sound of mind and body. bourgeoisie was educated, but also sporting. Roosevelt, the ultimate symbol of the introduction of sporting culture into American masculinity, liked to say "When you play, play hard. you work, don play at all."

Nor was La Tene art an exclusively "Celtic" art style; it wasn even purely "Celtic" in its genealogy. Based on an earlier and more conservative Halstatt style (probably innovated by earlier Celtic speakers), La Tene was significantly by Scythian, Etruscan and Greek art in regards to its incorporation of lifelike portrayals of animals exaggerated lines, detailed figural forms floral motifs and floral vegetal motifs respectively. So that all to say that yes, Celtic speaking people would have had recognizably "Celtic" artwork and objects, but so would speakers of other language groups, and that what we think of as "Celtic" artwork is essentially a synthesis of indigenous designs, Mediterranean and Eastern European motifs..
