"If I ever find myself teaching a poker class for the mathematics department at UCLA, this will be the only book on the syllabus."   Chris "Jesus" Ferguson, 2000 World Series of Poker Champion. "In the same way that quants and mathematicians took over Wall Street in the late 80's, mathematical methods will dominate poker in years to come. Chen and Ankenman have written the book that every serious poker player must read."  Jeffrey Yass, Founding Partner, Susquehanna International Group. "For those who think poker math is only about probability, pot odds, and straightforward, rote play, think again. Bill Chen and Jerrod Ankenman do a terrific job explaining how math can, among other things, show you exactly how to mix up your play in such a way that even champion players cannot get the best of you.

"Data from the airplane's flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the airplane's right elevator was positioned full trailing edge down (TED) when the flight crew first powered up the airplane on the day of the accident and remained there throughout the accident sequence. An airplane performance study (based, in part, on FDR data) confirmed that the airplane did not respond in pitch when the captain pulled on the control column. Based on the study's comparison with a previous takeoff, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the airplane's lack of rotational response to the control column input did not become apparent to the captain in time for him to have stopped the airplane on the runway.

What Mr Ivey and Ms Sun did was to persuade the croupier to turn some of the cards in the dealing shoe to permit them to know that they were or were very likely to be sevens, eights or nines, and in circumstances where she did not realise she had done so   and, if she had, would have immediately stopped play.
El Pino is pretty good food wise, but many people in the adoptee community avoid him due to his toxic personality. He's definitely built himself up, but he hasn't accepted that life is good now and demonstrates a need to show people he's "better" then they are. Every adoptee I met said the same thing, avoid D as a person, that he'll only talk shit about other people and simply associating with him in the adoptee community is a red flag..

Anne and Gilbert spent many an autumn evening at the lighthouse. It was always a cheery place. Even when the east wind sang in minor and the sea was dead and gray, hints of sunshine seemed to be lurking all about it. Perhaps this was because the First Mate always paraded it in panoply of gold. He was so large and effulgent that one hardly missed the sun, and his resounding purrs formed a pleasant accompaniment to the laughter and conversation which went on around Captain Jim's fireplace. Captain Jim and Gilbert had many long discussions and high converse on matters beyond the ken of cat or king.

This is a little hard to convey via text, but the ruling should be that any and all chips that cross the betting line (in this case invisible) are considered a bet, and once chips cross the line, obviously no more can enter the pot. So if Mislimi had went out with 60k and intentionally pulled back 30k, thus only betting 30k, his entire 60k should be required to stay in the pot. So his first motion he placed one stack, and the next motion he went sideways to put another stack.

Have surgery. If other methods do not succeed, surgery may be done to correct a hiatal hernia. This is recommended especially if you experience grave symptoms such as difficulty in breathing or continuous bleeding. The surgery will move the stomach back into its original position or repair the gap in the diaphragm. It can also wrap the upper stomach around the esophagus to compensate for a frail lower esophageal sphincter.

However, Smith believes that the fight was level after six rounds, and that he won the 11th and 12th rounds. Smith also thinks that the 10th round was a tossup round that could have gone either way. I really not surprised that Smith thinks the fight was close, because he also thinks he won the first Abraham Smith fight last year, and I saw that as another clear win for Abraham.

Goodness? Godly? Good gods. At this point, the disconnect between reality and policy is so great, the continuation of Dubbya religious war so clear, that it is impossible to assume President Obama is anything but the most cynical of men.

And so he is only operating out of a misguided sense that somehow increasing war abroad will lead to re election at home.

I quite liked a cocktail bar, then they did this. Sitting at the bar, a collection of 15 18 very pissed, mainly English and American that were "doing China" were ushered in by their tour group leader, told to sit at the back and not obstruct toilets. They said they had "seen China by visiting the Great Wall and Xi Shanghai was their last stop". They got vodka get poured into a 2L coke bottle, drunk as much as they could still, ordered more. Tried to steal my lighter several times while sitting at the bar, coz they thought they could, everyone hitting on everyone but no one being at all attractive. Fortunately their seating area was somewhat to the back. Got angry when the 1 hour was up, told they were going somewhere else and there would be more drink, and herded out of the door.

As with Backyard Beasts, the artwork is by Ned Barraud and follows the same brief (there is even some crossover with the insects mentioned in Beasts) providing sufficient detail for general animal identification. The design is pretty much the same, is easy to follow and perfect for dipping in and out of. Along with a short glossary, there is an index at the back that makes searching for your favourite animal easy, along with a contents page at the front. The language used here is simpler than Beasts, making the book accessible to a wider age range.

There were 20 of us. We all had to pay 100$ to get 1000 chips. We all had a blue chip (Survival chip) which we could use for another 1000 chips. The structure was 30 minutes each round. Starting with 1/2, 2/5, 5/10, 7/15, 10/20, 15/30, 25/50, 50/100 and so on. I lasted till the 50/100 (almost 6 hours including some short breaks). I started slow. I hit 1 8 pair on the flop and 1 10 pair on the turn. The cards open were a 2,7, 8 and 10. I had 8 and 10 in my hand. I played slow. The other guys knew I was new and I had been re raised which led to me folding in the past. This time, I was re raised on the turn and this was the biggest raise so far   200 chips. (Stupid mistake) I re raised him to 500 chips. Little did I know, he instantly called me and he had a straight. I was down to 300 350 odd chips. Then I won a few hands here and there. I thought I played well because I was able to increase the small pots well when I had a stronger hand. I somehow got through 6 rounds (3 hours) and I had 900+ chips. And then it was the last call to use the extra buy in. I was not gonna, but everybody with bigger stacks of 3000 chips also bought. 20 players had gone down to 12. So, I spent 100$ more.

Logically, it would seem that it is better to chase in an ODI game, unless there is a likelihood of the pitch deteriorating or slowing down. You would think that knowing the target would help in pacing out the innings, instead of going for too much and ending up with too little as it sometimes happens when batting first.

I think we done better than before by stating the rules and enforcing them as objectively as we can.

I know there are a lot of complaints about the sub, but again I think that more due to the person making the complaints mindset.

Eventually whatever muscles those are you get used to it and it'll be just how you move but I had to do it consistently for it to go away in athletics in highschool. good luck man

Unfortunately, a lot of doctors and PAs have never actually cared for a patient at the bedside (regardless of what you see on Greys Anatomy) and don't respect patients as actual people and think they're above them. They've never changed a bedpan or struggled to put in an IV or Foley catheter or had a psych patient try to fight them or gotten yelled at by family members constantly for being too slow or turned a 600 pound patient who has C dif diarrhea while managing 4 different vasopressor drips and ventilator with sedation to keep them alive. They see the patient as a task instead of a person.

Expand that question further out, once private industries start to take over things like road maintenance, sewage, and other necessities, again where is their motivation to act in the best interest of the consumer and not the profit margin? Companies already do this to a point, although are hindered by government regulation. Once that regulation is removed what is the motivation for corporations that now hold the very essence of life (water, sanitation) to not exploit people? I never talked to a libertarian that has been able to answer this question outside of "muh free market", disregarding the fact that once companies have deep enough pockets they just eliminate their competition and act however they please (like some are already doing, but are hindered by government red tape)..

Following the Supreme Court's decision to sustain President Obama's Affordable Care Act, allowing subsidies for poor and low income people everywhere, the country is taking fewer wobbly steps as a comprehensive health care nation, while little known parts of the ACA still teeter to find balance.

Two independent reviewers evaluated trials for methodological quality according to the Jadad scale, which awards points for randomisation, blinding and follow up. The most recent trial, which was also the largest and most rigorous, showed that those who received massage experienced more benefit than those who received light touch. The differences were statistically significant for immediate effects on pain and showed a trend, but were not statistically significant for sustained effects. Most trials found that massage had a positive effect at least on certain outcomes. The intervention was largely defined by exclusion criteria.  encompassed a range of databases with no language restrictions. Study validity was assessed, but the scale used was limited, particularly when dealing with trials of complex interventions such as massage. Trials showed variation in population, intervention, comparator and outcomes, so a narrative synthesis was appropriate. The overall conclusions appear reliable, although variation between types of intervention did not appear to have been considered fully.

I've been having this same problem because the book never specifies that anyone actually knows the true nature of the situation. i was thinking that eva and strahd probably both know, they've both been around a great many moons, but idk how to work it into the game. maybe strahd pops up and mentions it to izek/the PC group, or eva mentions it when the card reading happens. it's left to interpretation i think though, or just as a detail that's not meant to be known

In Football the standard is incredibly high with it being the worlds biggest sport. so talent required to make it is huge. in EPL literally hundreds at each teams academy don't make the level ever year. Do some homework on the matter and if you have any concerns talk to those in charge. such as EPL to La Liga. Also wages in Football are shooting through the roof with even further rapid increase in TV coverage and influx of multi billionaire owners as seen in EPL with Manchester City being owned by worlds richest family. and they have no where else to play and earn as every Gridiron league outside America has folded such as nfl Europe Answer No, it wouldn't be a very stable job.

It not Sufjan most ambitious or technically impressive album, but it still my favorite. It so personal, and yeah, sad, but still easy to relate to even though the subject matter doesn apply to my life directly. My favorite songs are "No Shade" and "John My Beloved". I got swallowed by the cliches of jeans, trucks and fireflies so I never really tried to explore it like a lot of other genres. In fact I was on record from a friend as liking any other genre but country. It was simple music for simple folk and kids who don't know better. That all changed with Sturgill's Metamodern Sounds in Country Music.

What constitutes an "unreasonable hazard" can vary a lot   where I am, for example, a homeowner can be liable for injuries due to iced over walkways, if they don take reasonable steps to keep the walkway clear, but if the walk is cleared properly and someone slips anyways, it not considered negligent.

However, its the last thing that should be happening to his character from the perspective of "making the Alliance diverse and interesting" because it just leads him down the path of being part of the same monolithic picture of chivalry as the rest of the Alliance. When Genn is an aggressive, exiled leader out for vengeance he provides valuable diversity to the Alliance cast. Changing that lessens the diversity.
So we would divide into groups in our costumes and travel through the trail system around this camp (out in the boons) and occasionally encounter roving monsters who we would have to fight using a simple dice based system. If we beat them they would offer up gold or other items.

I've honestly just started telling them I don't need vitals. I'm not sure why they always give them when they know I can just look at them in the computer (and am currently doing so) and then they read the doctors H to me straight off the screen. I get that they're covering their asses, but it legitimately feels like I get a report that isn't 100% straight off the MAR once a month (word for word, obviously I don't want them making shit up) and it's like they've never set eyes on the patient in their lives.

These are most of the types that I see in my home game. In Part 2 of this article, I'll go over some specific strategies for dealing with each type and go through some hand examples to help better understand how to read these players, which really isn't all that hard if you pay attention.

For some ChIP seq examples, some transcriptional activators and repressors work by binding near gene promoters and interacting with the transcriptional machinery there directly. Because of this, you would tend to annotate these proteins in relation to transcription start sites. On the other hand, there are certain proteins you would expect to be over gene bodies. These would include proteins like the RNA polymerase, and certain histone modifying enzymes (and the marks they themselves modify). There are other proteins whose expected regions of binding are a little less well defined in relations to genes. These could include proteins that bind to enhancers, and other proteins involved in 3D chromatin architecture, such as cohesin and CTCF. It may not necessarily be informative to annotate these naively in relation to gene features, but rather other higher order DNA architecture annotations would be better instead.

According to Entrepreneur, hydrotherapy equipment is extremely costly and may not be feasible. Another weakness is that many people see a day spa as a luxury that is out of their budget or can only be indulged in on special occasions, meaning the client base might be thin, especially as the business is just becoming established.

The developing picture is aptly described in a brochure for investors produced by banking giant Citigroup. The bank analysts describe a global society that is dividing into two blocs: the plutonomy and the rest. Then there are the the vast majority, now sometimes called the global precariat, the workforce living a precarious existence. In the US, they are subject to "growing worker insecurity," the basis for a healthy economy, as Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan explained to Congress while lauding his performance in economic management. This is the real shift of power in global society.
Generally the braggarts are the ones computer non savvy people think are great, when they aren half as good as they claim. Computer savvy people will generally recognize that computer knowledge isn a 0 100 continuum, it more like a tree and where the trunk is a base level of knowledge called computer literacy, and more advanced knowledge braches off in a number of different directions and no one is competent in all of them..

The two Dallas Hyatt hotels are separated by a runway, which makes the view from the rooftop pool at either hotel pretty spectacular. The difference between the two hotels is location and price.

[It pretty obvious that Neelix is reverse bluffing here, and he might be overdoing it. Since he obviously does know the rules and strategy my guess is that he really was unfamiliar with the game but they been playing for a little while now, and he read the rules. Neelix knew some pretty tough weirdos and probably got into a few scrapes. Even if he not a gambler, it reasonable that he been around gambling and can pick up on strategy quickly, especially since so much of it is seemingly a "mind game."]

This is where your anti bluff strategy comes into play; you don't want to show them too much strength at first because they may label you as a strong player and not try to bluff you. Give them a chance to take advantage of your supposed poker weaknesses, when in fact you have a strong read on them and you may benefit by letting them bluff one too many times and you will stack your opponent's chips.

And Korea has the highest smartphone penetration in the developed world, so of course crimes using smartphones could be a problem. Fundamentally there is no significant difference between korean men and American men, seeing that in the US, men have been caught storing upskirt photos, but ruled not guilty by the court because unlike Korea, molka is actually legal in most areas of the US.

Dont worry about it dude, all these people started out as beginers, they actualy have no right to give you shit, they have all been in the same boat dude, just keep playing and studying hard, if you study well then your understanding will evolve about every year, your understanding will improve, as for styles its ok to bet nitty in your understanding its a good base point to start your learning from, as you evolve your play will become looser and more balanced, untill eventuly you can claim a style that is yours, you can (given enough hard work and dedication) transend to a styleless state where you will thrive on situations and game types, theres alot of people in poker that think they are the dogs bollocks, and think they have the right to abuse people whome they think are lesser than themselves, you were just asking, and it takes alot of courage to post when your new and sometimes not sure of what your asking about, this forum should be moderated alot harder as far as new players are concerned, they can downvote me all they want i dont give a fuck, fucking bully bastards!!, anyway all the best to you!!!

Sex trafficking may be distinguished from other forms of commercial sex by applying the Action + Means + Purpose Model. Human trafficking occurs when a trafficker takes any one of the enumerated actions, and then employs the means of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of compelling the victim to provide commercial sex acts. At a minimum, one element from each column must be present to establish a potential situation of sex trafficking. The presence of force, fraud, or coercion indicates that the victim has not consented of his or her own free will. In addition, minors under the age of 18 engaging in commercial sex are considered victims of human trafficking regardless of the use of force, fraud, or coercion.
When looking at the menus today I noticed (to my slight disappointment) that the Blue Legume Cafe serves the kind of fare which most small restaurant/cafes London nowadays do. You know the kind that's called 'Modern British'; old fashioned food with a Mediterranean twist. But since this place almost always looks full, I decided here the food must be a little more special.

Just kinda lightly venting to you all, but my buddy who has recently won more than usual the past few nights he has played has shifted gears and now believes he is a serious and skilled poker player.

Let's use an example. Say that you're trying to convince a reluctant friend to buy a ticket to a fundraiser you're throwing. You know your friend is normally pretty stubborn, but you also know he's got a tremendous sweet tooth and that he also likes to be thought of as a gracious guest. You might casually invite him over to hang out, making sure there's a tray of warm cookies on the counter as he walks in. Let him eat as many as he wants, then ask him to buy a ticket.

Obama supported the no fly zone in Libya which led to the ouster and murder of Gaddafi, and the absolute disaster that country is in now. Libya isn even close to recovering from that.

You can buy short term T bills that mature in three or six months, or long term bonds that won't fully mature for 10 or even 30 years.

The story centers around Johanna, a psychologist who travels to Dreileben to help recapture the fugitive. She's forced to stay with an old friend, Vera and Vera's husband Bruno, a prolific German novelist. The film provides plenty of scenes with Johanna on the job, expanding on the personalities and quirks of police officers that were peripherally covered in the trilogy's first installment. But it's Johanna's friendship with Vera that's at the heart of this film. Director Graf injects a unique dose of humor and character detail that probes deep into the ambivalent, almost mysterious history surrounding Johanna and Vera's friendship. Sure, this movie is a thriller, but it's the ensuing drama surrounding the friends rather than the murderer that provides the most shocking dose of suspense.

Weather conditions will impact your treasure hunting. Ground that is thoroughly soaked after a rain or spring melt is easier to dig than sun baked hard pack.

Two pair will win, in Texas Holdem' hands ranking two pair is higher than three of a kind. The reverse is for all other types of poker. This is not even close to correct, whoever typed this is not smart or simply does not know poker rules. However, it also depends on whether the dealer qualified or not, and whether the player bet on the Pair Plus. On the Pair Plus it does not matter what the hand is, if it is a pair or better, it gets paid. If you are talking about other players on the table, it does not matter, in Three Card Poker the players play against the dealer and not each other. (Full Answer)

So it always depends on the chemical you after but it basically comes down to knowing what your chemical does and its properties. One protein I often extracted has a high positive charge and is extremely heat and acid resistant. So I grind up a heap of flowers, put them in an acid bath for a few hours, let all the chunky precipitated stuff sink to the bottom then filter the solution just to make sure all the chunky stuff is gone. I then neutralise the solution back to pH 7, boil it for a few more hours, filter the new precipitate formed and my solution now has a high concentration of my wanted protein. To finish it off I used a ionic exchange column but that a little more technical which you can read about here.
