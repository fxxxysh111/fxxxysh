It definitely is. The trading economy isn seamlesly integrated into the rest of the game as a system. If it was like the Steam market i consider it, but it not, it requires plenty of player interaction. It like saying the world chat is a important part of the game or something. Trading is very separate from the core gameplay loops and the customization in how it done and how it set up.

You've got great cards but act disinterested and bet low for the first few rounds of betting in order to get your opponents to keep putting money in the pot, which they wouldn't do if they thought you had great cards.

Looks like it probably some sort of bot that is at least attempting to post an HTML formatted list of links that are all titled for massages or pools in different towns in Korea. The long strings of numbers are the hex codes for different Korean characters and all direct for these Korean strings to be queried in what looks like a bunch of random web sites search functions, for instance one of them searches for the string in a search for the web site of Round Rock ISD, a school district in Texas. What, are you gonna write an Ikea like room planner for restaurant owners? And then they gonna spend hours on it? And then they going to keep it updated whenever they change floor plans? Just for what reason, so people can be slightly more picky when picking tables and can reserve a table that can be combined with the next one for a party of 6 for their party of 3? Again, all for basically no payoff for the restaurant owner? Oh and I suppose the restaurant owner is expected to pay for it too? This is the highest voted idea on this site..

The fact that the Sindhi language, Sindhi culture, and Sindhi socio political discourse at large are so removed from the overarching discussions about Karachi is telling. In these six decades Pakistani historians have lauded the sacrifices of immigrants from UP, Bihar and Punjab.

Where is that story in the larger national discourse? Think hard..

The information on the Paleolithic diet stated that it should be based on lean meat, fish, fruit, leafy and cruciferous vegetables, root vegetables, eggs and nuts, while excluding dairy products, cereal grains, beans, refined fats, sugar, candy, soft drinks, beer and extra addition of salt. The following items were recommended in limited amounts for the Paleolithic diet: eggs (2 per day), nuts (preferentially walnuts), dried fruit, potatoes (1 medium sized per day), rapeseed or olive oil (1 tablespoon per day), wine (1 glass per day). Animal versus plant foods).

You can see that DuecesCrazy99 came into 68% of the pots, raised 40% of those times, and bet out at the flop 100% of the time!

Steadiness getting up from a chair;
I mean I agree things are definitely heightened/exaggerated but I always saw it as being staged as a tragic melodrama, as many Darren Aronofsky movies are (the first sounds of the film are a symphony warming up, as if you were in a theater about to watch some operatic performance). The theme of the film is not "drugs are bad" but how addiction and the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream can get tangled and lead to one's self destruction, in this case it's characters using drugs to obtain that goal. So objectively yes, drugs like opiates and uppers can be very bad for you, people have gotten infections from using dirty needles, whored themselves out to maintain an expensive drug habit, get jailed for holding drugs, and have died/been irreparably damaged from legal drugs. I never got the sense that the movie was saying "try drugs once and you'll die" but saw it more as using all the tools of the medium of film to depict a tragedy of people who have good intentions but continue down a path that will inevitably lead to their own annihilation (a common theme of Aronofsky's movies).

I always aim to do a 5 or 10km tempo, intervals/fartleks, hills/stairs, and a long run every week. For the last two months, I run every day but I do try to alternate between a training run and an or run. Unfortunately I think I tend to do all my runs instead of hard days hard, easy days easy, and it is probably what is hurting my performance the most. I have a hard time sticking to any strength training or stretching and often neglect both (need to fix my mindset on these). Two years ago I was a couch potato who loathed running. Now I obsessed with it, so I just need to figure out how to feel that way about strength. The last few months I averaged 60km/week. I rested from Thursday (Which felt really weird after a two month streak). I did start carb loading a bit on Wednesday, and drank plenty of water.

On a flop of AKQ, this will smash his 3 betting range, he will have sets and two pairs so often here. Despite this range advantage, the opponent raises this flop basically representing QQ or JT and maybe AK as value, and combo diamonds (most likely Adxd for) for semibluffs. Raising a hand like AQ on the flop from the opponent would be considered a pretty big overplay given charlie range and charlie hand almost feels fairly face up as very strong. Charlie must have exploitatively put his opponent on just QQ here or JT and hence why he was rooting for an A (K would do as well) as he expected his opponent is value heavy (QQ, JT) and he is drawing to 4 outs. Another consideration is that the hand started over 200 big blinds deep so it is a reasonable assumption that people don get too out of line with bluffs here in this spot this deep.

While playing no limit Hold'em, your first instinct will probably be to move all in when you see pocket aces. In a typical game, this will win you the pot, but you will likely win only the blinds since everyone else probably folded. When you have a great starting hand such as AA, KK, AK, or QQ, your goal should be to raise enough to make all but one or two opponents fold. Then, if you are reraised before the flop, you can move all in. Winning the most pots in a session is nice, but winning the most money is what counts. For this reason you must consider how to maximize your winnings with your best hands. The strategies concerning checking, raising, and check raising are all tools you can use to make money at the poker table.

When you receive massage or bodywork, cell waste (which is already in your system) gets released at a more rapid rate than normal. Your body has to deal with the larger amount of material within the same amount of time, and that is what can cause you to feel tired, sick, or sore afterward. Proper hydration allows the body to process the waste easier and excrete the out through urine or sweat.

Another friend of ours had an almost 4 year old son that was stubborn like your child. She felt like she had tried everything and every road lead to a battle with her son. I gave her the book and told her to commit to it for a month. Her son was potty trained in 3 weeks   day and night.

This article considers one strategy   called "tight" in poker and compares it with trading. In poker almost every table has a very tight player. They only open with aces suited or a high pair.

A couple of weeks I happened to catch General Musharraf speaking to the from the Presidency in Islamabad when he was speaking about benevolent dictatorships and how good they can be for a country he was doing so with a complete poker face and I couldn believe that his handlers had not given him a script or talking points before this question/answer session. Dictatorships benevolent or not are a thing of the past and shouldn really be discussed in polite company especially by dictators themselves. Once I got past the lecture on benevolent dictatorships I had to switch over to the Tom Jerry marathon which is far more entertaining..

My freshmen roommate my last year was a similar sort of goddamn personified filth, and we kinda established an unspoken routine with toilet paper  you finish it, you replace it from your stash. Until she failed to replace three times in a row, not to mention, she had two boyfriends over 24/7, so she was using the majority of the toilet paper. So I decided I wouldn replace it this time. I would force her to get her ass up and walk to the Walmart one minute from our building.

I finished the first floor and headed down into the basement where the guy had died. It was mid July and it was hotter than shit on asphalt. But as soon as I got to the basement it was like somebody turned on the A/C. Of course, it was pitch black in the basement because A) it's a basement and there's not much light down there on a normal day and B) that's where the bulk of the fire was so everything was pitch black. I walked through the basement into the bedroom. The fire hadn't reached the bedroom as it had been started at the stairwell which acted as a decent chimney to prevent fire spread throughout the basement, but it did get hot enough in this room that the outline of the guys body was in the carpet right next to his dog's body's outline. As soon as I entered that room every single alarm bell in my mind was screaming "get the fuck out you moronic jackass, have you not seen a god damn horror movie? This is where the angry ghost of gramps murders you with a hatchet!" But I had a job to do so I stayed, took my photos and collected samples, searched the whole basement for anything to give an idea why this would happen. I frequently had to leave the basement to go outside to give my brain time to stop freaking the fuck out. And every time I walked back in the house everything in me was telling me to leave. The whole time I was in the basement it was like someone was standing In the corner, just watching me. And of course I was working by my tiny ass flashlight that's basically useless so that didn't help much.

Moving stuff: Baselayer and fleece, in whatever combination, selected so that I rarely have to remove and carry the fleece. For those types of temperatures, a heavyweight baselayer and a zip up hoody fleece (MH Microchill is what I have) would be my go to, although I might go light base+Melanzana+Microchill, if I were confident that it wouldn warm up so much that I have to carry the Melly. Basically, during the hottest part of the day, my ideal is to have an unzipped hooded fleece over a base layer (and possibly over the Melly, too, if it cold).

So in poker, the "300 bucks" is basically having fun playing the game, being a good player, being rewarded, etc. the "stabbing in the arm" is just a bad beat. it happens randomly, u dont know when, it hurts when it happens. fuckin terrible. but some people can tolerate it and some people can and if you call someone a pussy for not being able to handle a bad beat well you kind of being a dickheadi the type of person that if i see like blatant bigotry i just go ahead and watch the other person unfold when i explain to them how they are wrong. usually it ends up being entertaining, they tend to not respond with logical points, start changing the subject, get butthurt, etc. but sometimes, if im lucky, they prove me wrong and i grow as a person.

Should I try to be opening more pre flop? I know in normal poker you should rarely limp in but 1/2 NL seems to be a somewhat different game.

The turn card is also very important. If you bet big on the turn when you've been betting moderately earlier, players can be more intimidated. If you think you've actually won the hand on the turn card, you may even want to just check, and then bet like crazy on the river. People are more likely to make/call a big bet, if you checked before, thinking you might be weak/bluffing. This works even better, if you've been (accidentally?) caught bluffing earlier.
A lot of what I enjoy about the game is the relatively slow pace. This is one of the first open world games that has actually made me want to slow down and enjoy the world. I love traveling everywhere, ignoring the story and just wandering around exploring and hunting and fishing. The story is great, but overall a small part of what I love about RDR2.

These frozen meals can cost $2 each but that's still cheaper than eating out, it's healthier and it adds some much needed variance to our lunches. Frozen foods will never be as healthy as something freshly made, but time isn't always on our side.

Disney is well known for doing unethical shit after weighing the cost of a lawsuit vs the cash gain.

There are three types of melasma, each classified according to the layer of skin the condition affects. Epidermal melasma affects the epidermis, or the top layer of skin. These patches are usually dark brown with well defined borders, and they respond easily to treatment. Dermal melasma affects the second, deeper layer of skin, called the dermis. In dermal melasma the patches are lighter brown than epidermal melasma, have borders that are less precise and do not respond well to treatment. The third type of melasma is called mixed melasma, which is a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma. Mixed melasma usually improves somewhat when treated.
