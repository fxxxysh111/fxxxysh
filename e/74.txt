The resolution is destined to pass the House, where the Democrats hold a majority, and probably will clear the GOP controlled Senate in coming weeks. But it's unlikely to get enough support in either chamber to override a promised veto by Trump.With the votes, both parties will be staking out ground on what's likely to be one of the more divisive issues in the 2020 election, while also highlighting a power struggle that's been brewing for years between Congress and the White House over how much control a gridlocked legislature should cede to the executive branch.It also sets the tone for the next two years of divided government, putting congressional Republicans in the uncomfortable position of opposing their president or defending unilateral White House action they sharply criticized in the Obama administration.Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Tuesday she will support the resolution, putting the Democrats within one GOP vote of the number needed to pass the resolution in that chamber if all Democrats and independents vote yes.Murkowski said that with the emergency declaration, Trump "is overstepping into the legislative prerogative.

I tend to look for people who are smiling when they are talking to people. It means they are actively engaged in the conversation, and are more likely to have an easy going demeanor and are open to lighter conversation. It a great way to start. If everyone is very stiff, I try to find smaller groups of people. That way I can just listen. Removing the requirement to actually talk for the first conversation helps a lot. Eventually someone in the group will ask something removing the need for me to come up and start the conversation. If they don just listen and smile. First steps are still steps, no matter how small.

But I don think just because some people have their mental illness "cured", that they should imply others can do the same. Everyone different and it never straight forward. I love to be cured, my issues make daily tasks super hard, but I tried a lot of things and I still mentally ill. But I do believe people with depression/anxiety are almost always capable of doing some basic things and not rely on other people to do everything for them. I don feel that acceptable long term even if someone depressed or has anxiety. You shouldn lump everything on others and you don have to. If you can move any part of your body then you can do something.

Galton was hardly alone in figuring out a communication system though from what I can tell seems to stand out in his thinking on what was actually being said.

The Soofas being installed at various locations around the city in the coming weeks won't cost the city anything (Cisco picked up the tab, and has its logo is engraved on the panels accordingly), and the technology has a lot of potential beyond charging our phones.

And USB ports are getting more powerful (Gizmodo said they "could be the power outlets of the [very near] future'').

The big problem there is that vape shops are generally not the ones selling underaged users the products. You can find Juuls in gas stations, 7 11's, and many chains across the country. If you go in to a vape shop the employees almost always actually care about the industry, and wish to protect it, meaning that they religiously ID, as was the case in the shop I worked for, and all others I have been to in my area. However, as was the case when I was 14 and bought my first pack, some random guy at the gas station who just wants to earn enough for rent and a six pack doesn't really give a shit, and is willing to just kinda look the other way for a sale. The second half of this problem was the immense amount that was being bought online by underaged users with a credit car mommy and daddy gave them, and then they ignored the bill for. (I should note that this problem has for the most part died down, as every real website for vapes in the US now requires age verification of some for further than "hey when were you born, enter the date here") Basically shitty parents were just giving their kids a card, letting them do whatever they wanted, and then when they had payed no attention for months or years and found a vape in their kids rooms they got mad that the rest of the world wasn't watching their kid for them.

Plastic containers and bottles that hold our food and water may be slowly poisoning us. In the study that first got my attention, the American Academy of Pediatrics called out to parents to rethink using plastic products for their kids.

Phthalates, used to make plastic storage wrapand containers, also are absorbed into food. They can disrupt the endocrine system, cause weight gain, and harm the heart. Adults should be concerned about this, especially for growing children.

What made me realize How foolish my running a large credit card balance was when I sat down and with a pen and wrote out how much interest I was paying in a year. For many years I took great pride in not using a card.

I think you letting your prejudices against Muslims in general cloud your judgement here. If there are Muslims who do share liberal beliefs, what do we gain by attacking them even if they not in the majority? Do you think those moderate voices are going to be more likely to support us or liberal ideologies if we seen as attacking all Muslims, regardless of their individual beliefs? You just making it easier for the hardliners to say "see, even when Muslims act like Westerners they still hated".

We believe that the practice of homosexuality tears at the fabric of society, contributes to the breakdown of the family unit, and leads to the spread of dangerous, communicable diseases. Homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God, recognized by our country's founders, and shared by the majority of Texans. Homosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable "alternative" lifestyle in our public education and policy, nor should "family" be redefined to include homosexual "couples." We are opposed to any granting of special legal entitlements, refuse to recognize, or grant special privileges including, but not limited to: marriage between persons of the same sex (regardless of state of origin), custody of children by homosexuals, homosexual partner insurance or retirement benefits.

It is a wonderful thing to open these dis associated image combinatorics to free interpretation, each viewer finding their own meaning in a mysteriously composed components.This of course was an unintentional artifact of the artist and engraver.

Wild CardsNow for the fun part. There are three wild cards: twos, tens and jacks. If a two is played, the pile is 'set' back down to two: the next person can play a three, and so on. If a ten is played, the next player ignores the ten and has to meet or beat the card that was played just before it. For example, if Player 1 plays a queen and Player 2 plays a ten, Player 3 then has to beat the queen. And finally, if a jack is played, the order of play is reversed, from clockwise to counterclockwise or vice versa, which means that the player who played the last card now has to beat it2.

As a result, the only means to return to LTE in this situation is for the phone to return to RRC idle mode in 3G/UMTS/HSPA.

If the phone finds a good LTE signal, it will perform a tracking area update procedure and re establish the bearers for data flow..

Two days ago, I got a deep tissue massage that I suppose went a little deeper than I usually go. I'm having some new side effects that I have never experienced before and would very much like to get rid of. First, I have the muscle soreness (not unusual) but also I have extreme skin sensitivity throughout my body, even on areas that were not massaged.

If you look at the information just based on what you have it makes total sense for him to have Aces, or AQ, there's no way he has the confidence the check shove AK because he has already represented a good hand.

So the day of the party rolls around and all ten of us show up to PF Chang's on a Friday night. The restaurant is super packed and Jane ask CB if she made a reservation. CB says no why would they need one. CB ask how long to be seated for a party of ten and the hostess says about an hour and a half. CB isn't having it, gets mad, says things like "we're having a party, we're going to spend a ton of money anyways". Needless to say she's hungry and doesn't want to wait an hour and a half to eat. She gets her bf to drive her to a Taco Bell for a snack (mind you we are all still waiting at PF Chang's). She comes back an hour later, still complaining about the wait. Finally we get seated.
A poker hand such as JTM JTM 4TM 4TM 9TM , that contains two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank (that match each other but not the first pair), plus any card not of either rank, is called two pair. If both hands have the same top pair, then the second pair of each is compared, such that 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM 4TM defeats 10TM 10TM 4TM 4TM 8TM . If both hands have the same two pairs, the kicker determines the winner, so 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM ATM beats 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM 4TM .

It really helps to change up your playstyle at the table, also. Get a reputation for being rash, get caught bluffing once or twice. Then once people recognize you for that, switch playstyle. Be very conservative with your cards, and only play guaranteed wins. Flip flop between the two, and not only will you make it hard for them to read you, but they'll also be more likely to call bets when you want them to, and fold when you're trying to bluff them out.
And on top of telling people to just "accept them the way they are," while telling anyone who is remotely healthy weight compared to them that they "twigs," "too skinny," and "just need to eat more," they judge men for completely uncontrollable things like you mentioned. I know I going to be judged for being quite a bit shorter than the average height, and I accept that. I however am not okay with people who demand to be accepted how they are (due to personal choices) then judge me for physical characteristics i actually have 0 influence on.

Unfortunately, avoiding immunity boosters is really the only thing that can save the people who are susceptible to colds, other than telling them to try to avoid all 200 of the viruses that office workers and schoolchildren are basically stewing in during the winter months. If you don't want to walk around in a hazmat suit, your only other option is to get sick 200 times. Just like with chickenpox, every time your body gets a cold, it cooks up a specially designed defense for the next time it invades. But since there are 200 different viruses that our bodies freak out about, you'll need to get over 200 colds before your body learns it's time for everybody to start acting like a couple of Fonzies and chill.

Drug addict, high on opiates used an exacto knife to cut between the shaft of the penis and the inside of his cock head.

He then used those low quality rough brown paper towels you see in public restrooms, and stuffed it underneath the partially degloved head to stem the blood flow.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with Canada being made up of all sorts of races.

Sorry. As a guy who cut fish for a living, I described what I imagined to be one thing but clearly was another. The hole underneath the vertebra on the left side looks like what I rinse out when a fish gets bled out, to me intimating that that side is the inside of the abdominal cavity. Now, putting the orientation of the vertebra into perspective, to me, it looked like the protruding piece of bone would be a seam running between the two sides of the fish. The bone, pointing down, wouldn I guess really be representative of a coccyx, but might instead be running down to the anal fin? I did a bad job of explaining what I thought I saw. Sorry.

A major victory was scored for economic justice and just plain old common sense this week when Congress finally put an end to the biggest rip off of college students ever seen: the Student Loan Industry.

You're going to see headline after headline about how little all these tech startups are paying in taxes once they turn profitable, because plenty of them have been burning cash for years. If they lost the deductibility of their startup expenses because they didn't make enough profit in the year the expenses were accrued, there would be a massive disincentive to start up new businesses and a HUGE advantage to already big business which would have the profits to use the deductions that year.

I don think it looks nearly as bad as others here are saying, and obviously it important to the guy who proposed. Just seems super shallow to me.

If art's mission is to change public perceptions or to transcend established practices, it can no longer be apolitical, unaware of social or economic currents. The creators of an exhibit that examines the "cultural afterlife" of taxidermised polar bears (nanoq: flat out and bluesome, by Brynds Snbjrnsdttir and Mark Wilson) sum up a rather recent shift in our attitudes toward their subject: "During the last decade the image of the polar bear has moved in the public imagination from being an icon of strength, independence and survival in one of the most climatically extreme of world environments, to that of fragility, vulnerability and more generally of a global environmental crisis.".

I can even tell you all of the violations he was hit with (I know there was speeding, something about bumpers, exhaust noise, no plates or registration, no brake or indicator lights, etc) but it was enough moving violations that he got 12+ points on the spot and immediately lost his license for 6 months.
