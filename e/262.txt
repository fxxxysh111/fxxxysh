So the FAQ is in a pretty sorry state at the moment as is pointed out to me on a fairly regular basis. A lot of the links are dead now and it was written at a time when questions were discouraged in this sub and so was trying to preempt the more common ones. I don think this really makes sense anymore and it probably would be better as a general running wiki containing running and /r/running related resources. I also think it would be great to copy /u/kyle kranz running posts into the FAQ so we never lose them. The effort and detail that went into them is well worth preserving.

Using Keepass with Dropbox on our iPhone, Android phone, tablets, Linux laptops and Windows desktops, always just worked. The downside? You had to alt tab to the app and copy and paste the password; however, many sites don use recognizable password fields, so you end up doing that with LastPass anyway. The worst thing about Keepass was the file wouldn necessarily get saved back to Dropbox properly, so we end up spawning copies of it and have to import them back into the original occasionally. But I see now that wasn that bad of a problem, and with a little more research and possibly a different Keepass client I bet that can be solved.

The current information suggests a valuable role in joint manipulation in preserving the joint lubrication abilities and enhancing the removal of waste products in these vulnerable, avascular structures.In 1995, Buckwalter, MD (1) concluded based on his research, that intervertebral discs undergo age related degenerative changes.The most important cause appears to be declining joint nutrition and lubrication of the central disc, which allows an accumulation of cell waste products, degraded matrix molecules, and a fall in pH.He noted that the factors, which may increase the rate and severity of declining changes byaltering joint nutrition include: immobilization, sustained disc loading, vibration and spinal deformity.Buckwalter findings echo the conclusions of a 1993 paper by Holm, PhD (2) in which a summary illustration noted that discs have an uneven distribution of the few cells they contain and that these cells are subjected to much metabolic variation.This makes discs/joints susceptible to lubrication/nutrition deficiencies.What we know today is that movement of the vertebral motion segments is essential for joint health and lubrication.

I was about to pull out of the parking lot, so I stopped to catch up with you so I could say bye. As I mentioned to you guys I have a friend in Ft Worth so next visit we will have to plan an easy long run. Nothing stupid. Glad I could convince you to do this though.

The answer is roughly 1 in 1.56 trillion, and on May 23, Patricia Demauro, a New Jersey grandmother, beat those odds at Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa. Demauro's 154 roll lucky streak, which lasted four hours and 18 minutes, broke the world records for the longest craps roll and the most successive dice rolls without "sevening out." According to Stanford University statistics professor Thomas Cover, the chances of that happening are smaller than getting struck by lightning (one in a million), being hit by an errant ball at a baseball game (one in 1.5 million) or winning the lottery (one in 100 million, depending on the game).

If you find that you not losing that much weight, have you considered calculating your new TDEE? As we lose weight and grow fitter, our bodies require less and less calories for maintenance. Your diet may have helped you reach 220, but you may require an updated TDEE in order to get the new number and then get that  20%, or  25% to continue weight loss at the rate you wish to see. LoseIt has been extremely helpful for me as well, and I learned about that there. 
Regular salt (table salt) is iodized, which gives it a different taste. Things like sea salt or kosher salt do not have that same taste and I think actually are much stronger and have a better flavor. My favorite salt is actually Maldon Sea Salt Flakes, but typically when I am baking I just use finely ground sea salt because it is more accessible (flake salt would have to be manually crushed and I am a bit lazy for that).Here a great writeup on the difference between Kosher and Iodized Table Salt.RE: Coffee, coffee is a complimentary flavor to chocolate.

It just that your personal experience is highly biased. They have certified their RNG. Yes there are no ways to track hands in a database but that doesn equal rigged. The idea that any poker site would include a program to have everyone put bad beats on each other to get more rake is just so flawed that tilts me people can get on board with it. How would that benefit them at all when the rake is capped at a certain BB threshold that can be met easily without any all ins?

When we were kids we pretty much forced her to cuddle and eventually she just gave in. I think part of it is that as kids getting these cats was a huge deal and once we got them we were so excited we couldn leave them alone.

I don know enough about the retirement systems of various countries, but wealth will really vary based on what government does. If the government takes 2% of your income to put into unemployment, that not wealth for when you don have a job. If the government provides no unemployment benefit and you put away 4% of your salary into a bank account in case you lose your job, that is wealth. However, if you lose your job, the 4% of your income that you put away might not cover expenses as well as the 2% the government has put away from everyone to spread the risk over more people. So, is the second person really wealthier? Frankly, it will depend on one judgement of the risk of being jobless, one politics, etc.

This strategy can also be useful for estate planning if you wish to maximize the amount available to your heirs by lowering your tax bill on death. For example, for someone in a lower  or middle income tax bracket, it may make sense to strategically withdraw more than the mandatory minimum annual amount from your RRIF. These withdrawals might be taxed at lower rates while you alive, rather than have the entire fair market value of your RRIF (or RRSP, for that matter) taxed as income in the year of death (absent a tax deferred transfer to a surviving spouse or partner).

Be involved in the bidding: You see it all the time in auction: A player goes for well below the value he's expected to go for. Staying involved in the action has two advantages. First, it allows you the possibility of getting a great value when the crickets come early. In a 12 team league, 276 players will be put up for auction. As such, lightning only needs to strike less than 0.4 percent of the time to make it worth your while. Second, getting involved often (not every time of course) allows you to stay sharp. It is similar to fielders who stay sharp when the pitcher works fast as opposed to those who lose focus when the pitcher takes a long time between pitches.

Varicose veins, also known as spider veins, happen when your blood circulation slows down. This often occurs in pregnant women, and overweight and constipated individuals. If left untreated, they will be more inflamed making them more painful, not to mention an unpleasant sight to the naked eye. There are several options that you can choose to treat varicose veins. The most expensive is having surgery to totally remove them. You can also have spa treatments or buy commercial creams, but that can be costly too. Creams and ointment can also be harsh to your skin due to chemically induced ingredients. If you want to use the most natural treatment, you can always create your own massage oil. It is cost effective and easy. To learn more about how to make your own massage oil treatment that is solely for varicose veins, here are some very simple steps that you can follow.

My daughter paternal grandmother insists, still to this day, on being called "grand mommy". Because she was not old enough to be a grandmother either.

Etc?The simple field tests I mentioned, and thermal imaging are probably best   thermal imaging has the potential to expose a problem (or more accurately an area of injury) which hasn been considered or which was erroneously ruled out. X rays for those problems would require recumbency (putting her totally under and laying her down), but the catch 22 is those injuries are also likely to be seriously aggravated as she wakes up and tries to get her footing (I personally had a horse break his leg waking up after colic surgery, requiring his euthanasia   and he was even in a recovery room purpose built to prevent injuries as they come out of anesthesia), so tbh I wouldn recommend radiographs unless your vet it super confident it can be done safely.Honestly, aside from thermography your best bet for deciding neurologic vs mechanical injury might be a course of strong anti inflammatories and Robaxin (or similar muscle relaxer) for a week, followed by a dose of analgesic (one which provides good relief of pain without significant motor impairment) and concurrent lameness exam.

The RRSP savings would generate tax savings. They will vary with changes in gross income and any taxable events, but if we assume that Max is in a 40 per cent tax bracket, refunds from RRSP contributions could be $12,000 per year. That could go to paying down the three per cent mortgage, but Max and Loretta could likely earn a higher rate of return by investing the money in low fee exchange traded funds..

I also went through the same conundrum and the consensus with everyone I knew was that it was normal for the landlord to ask for it when trying to find a new tenant. People walk into rental offices and want to see new apartments then and there so there's not always time for making an appointment, especially if it's a smaller place. If the real estate agent tells them "Sorry but you'll have to wait to see this place tomorrow when the renter is home" then they'll usually just ask to look at other places or visit another realtor, which is bad for your landlord who wants to find someone to replace you ASAP. It's all about timing.

As far as stress, I don know if nerves make my hands shake worse, but if you anything like me, you experience nerves when you have big hands and when you bluffing, so you be "balanced" on that front. Nerves also improve with experience. Most people who play live for the first time feel nerves even when they mostly folding because they worried about making a mistake. As time passes, you can bluff and get in huge pots without feeling as much stress, which hopefully for you would mean your tremors won spike.
Considering my husband and I pay 9k a year for daycare for just ONE child 13k doesn't even begin to cover the cost of raising 2 children. I'm glad you can see that this isn't really "free" money for your mom, it's just getting back a portion of what she paid in. I'm honestly shocked at how many people have said child support never goes to the kid, it's not intended to be handed over to the child to put in savings or to buy frivolous things but instead to help pay the costs of raising a kid and to ensure that the child has a similar lifestyle in both homes. So groceries, additional bills, health insurance, clothes, etc.

If there isn as much content, then the boost isn as useful since there little point in accruing extra gold.

Obama turned from an occupation force to a drone force, which reduced casualties caused by America by 97%. Bush killed more people in his first WEEK of Iraq (4,000) than Obama did his entire presidency with drones. Yet, Obama killed more military targets in a year than Bush did in his 6 years in Iraq. And of course, Obama and his military were very very cautious about avoiding civilian deaths.

The main point I'm trying to make is that putting a post about monetary value sold to a private buyer doesn't belong in a reddit about museums, it's questionable that he'll allow access to this work as long as it "remains in (his) position" implying that the collector is a part of the creative process when they are not. Citing celebrity artist like Jeff koons who has stated in the past that he can't create his own works with his hands any more because the high demand of his celebrity presence is more important isn't a great example as it removes the artist from their craft even more..

For example, there is a player who hasn played a hand in the first hour while you been sitting. Now preflop, someone calls, a couple of players fold and then he raises. Do you know his exact hand? No. But you can start narrowing it down. He probably has something good since he seems tight. He probably doesn have 73 or J2. He might have QQ or AK. So maybe his range is TT+, AQ+.

I know there are a lot of complaints about the sub, but again I think that more due to the person making the complaints mindset.

My mom disliked her a lot. I'd often roller blade or bike over to my friends house and stay the night and then go back home in the morning. Ava went to work one weekend (this was the 90s/early 00s and we got left alone a lot), and she came home on her break and saw me there and she called my mom and my mom was so angry with her because she'd left a voicemail saying "this is Ava. come get your kid" and that was it. She didn't even ask me to leave to my face. My mom had never had to pick me up from there and I was so confused when she showed up, fuming about how Ava had "addressed me".

Aging is not a disease, it is a progressive biological change and there may be vast differences in the health of people who are aged 65 and over. One older patient may not be able to tolerate a medical treatment because of accumulated comorbidities, but another of the same age without comorbidities may easily do so. Despite this, I've often come across investigators in medical research who've arbitrarily lumped everyone aged 65 and above in one group, instead of using the same sequential period as younger age groups. This averaging can result in treating a relatively healthy 65 year old patient identically to one much older or less healthy.

Many people out there in the casinos are often asking a simple question, why these products are so popular among the people? Why the poker leaders are always looking for a good protector product like Im a LuckSack Medallion Poker Card Protector? Well, the answer is related to a history of the leaders in the field of poker. Some of them used to bend the cards in their hands and thus ruined them all. They needed something to protect the cards and that's why the thought about these poker products.

I also think folding is WAY too nitty. I would settle on a call and reevaluate on the turn.. 
As for the traditional Western gunfight as depicted in movies, the inaccuracy of handguns at the time would have made quick drawing skill irrelevant: It was simply so unlikely you'd hit a guy on the first, second or third shot that it didn't really matter which guy got out his gun first. The closest history got to high noon show downs was dueling, where people just stood across from one another with their guns out, aimed and fired until someone got lucky, and someone else was dead. Forget about "fanning," rapidly cocking a single action revolver between rounds like Clint Eastwood does in A Fistful of Dollars. 
AA/KK don beat any of our value combos, so we need to be bluffing 30% of the time for them to call profitably. Some opponents would call, though I think this is probably a fold, especially with the Ah/Kh in their hand.

Gorgc isn that amazing of a carry player. Gorgc strength as a dota 2 player is that he is consistent. But he is not extraordinary otherwise. Hes not some superstar that comes out of nowhere and just shits on everyone and everything (2015 sumail) but he is a consistent top tier player as far as maintaining his own personal skill. But despite that, there is a reason Gorgc has not been approached for a pro/semi shitter team in a while. And its because of Gorgc attitude and the fact hes very whiny.

Another Adelaide Test, and another great makes his Test debut. Australia released Bill "Tiger" O'Reilly, and though his four wickets played second fiddle to Clarrie Grimmett's 14 in this one, he went on to take 144 wickets in a brilliant 27 Test career.

The great man had nobody to blame, though: he ran out last man Pud Thurlow while looking for run No. High on confidence after winning the first game, in Adelaide, by five wickets, India cleaned up the hosts by ten wickets, chasing 66 inside ten overs after rain intervened. Tight bowling and excellent fielding made the victory all the more comprehensive. They couldn't repeat the feat in the one day series that followed, though, losing 1 2.
