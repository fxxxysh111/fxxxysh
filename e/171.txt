We are forgetting that your costs are going to be significantly higher than a traditional physical therapist because you are mobile. In a traditional setting your real only major upkeep is the building, which is usually defrayed due to the fact that the building usually houses multiple doctors, physical therapists, etc. With your mobile format you not only have to cover the cost of your mobile format on just the two of you, but also compensate for time lost in between patients. In a traditional setting the patients come to you and wait, meaning there is really no downtime between patients for the caregiver. In your format not only will you have to drive to the person, but once there you have to wait for them to come to you. So you are looking at having adjust your prices to cover what I assuming is going to be an RV(to fit hand bikes and shit in it), the upkeep on the RV, the downtime between patients, and the non billing of health insurance, all just to meet cost. Not to mention I assuming you want to get paid for this venture, so that even more. People around here aren going to be willing to shell that much out of pocket. Especially when they have insurance with a much lower copay.

Due to the decreased relative contribution of the hip adductors in cycling, I believe this is less likely. Alternatively, two muscles that attach below the knee joint that are capable of producing the pain you describe are gracilis (also a hip adductor, but crosses the knee joint), and sartorius. The action of sartorius is to flex the knee, flex the hip, and internally rotate the hip. When cycling and strongly pulling up on the pedals (as in a seated, low cadence climb), sartorius is powerfully contracting and can lead to both a tendon friction injury across the medial joint line (inside of the knee) and also an inflammation of the bursa (fluid filled sac designed to reduce friction) at its insertion (attachment) below the knee.

The turn in the road on road signs here was to paint the destination in black on a field of white, accompanied by a pointing hand. 
Another train of thought is funding the joint account with amounts equally proportional to their individual earnings. Kind of like how tax brackets work. I tried this once and the person paying the higher proportion didn find it fair at all. I guess a flat tax. everyone is equally unhappy.

Bondage tape and plumbers tape are not body safe implant grade materials meant for long term wear. The skin in your freshly stretched fistula is a little more fragile than a healed piercing or stretch. Obviously you don't want to breach the skin barrier and tear the skin in the fistula, but fresh stretches can be more prone to irritation from toxic materials.

At the end of the day though, this is what your grandpa wanted, you know? If he wanted them to have 500k he would have split it up that way, assuming he was mentally sound n all.

Draft IS good to fill out, assuming you know what you are doing, and it also a lot more fun cause the playing field is more even. The problem was you never did your research, look up draft list rankings (LSVs or others) for reference, STICK to a game plan when you are drafting unless you can afford to take that off colour rare without having to play it and affecting your deck. There no/few mana fix in draft, so plan your colour choices early and see what colours the bots are leaving you for during the first pack. There no point getting a bomb but needing a 3rd colour that you need to add land in for, if it a splash, it won even be 1/3 of your land, which is just slightly more than 1/3 of your deck, so you less than 1/9 chance in getting that splash colour to pay for that bomb. RIP if you need TWO of the splash colour.

Eloquent and surprisingly respect rhetoric from a GOP rep, but missing some key facts. In particular, when it comes to taxing the rich you can just focus on "income". Most middle class and all poor have all of their wealth come from income directly. But the rich get money thru inheritance, capital gains, and hoarded/hidden in overseas banks (and they fight like hell to make sure this is never ever taxed). If THIS money were taxed at the same rate and without the various loopholes that allow tax avoidance, then we see better revenue and better outcomes. That why it isn a lie to say the rich don pay their fair share, but it is a lie of omission to bring up income but leave out capital gains.

In fact, the real world effects of the federal government spending more than 50% of all tax dollars on defense and defense related industries, not just in VT but everywhere, is that the US government must engage in constant and permanent war to defend such expenditures. Obama would have to find another war if he did not increase the war in Afghanistan or start to actually lower military expenditures.

The sub is what it is. When I first came on as mod I was passionate about making this a welcome place for everyone and particularly more welcoming for Koreans than it had been, but over time I realized this wasn possible to enforce in an even remotely consistent fashion. I think we done better than before by stating the rules and enforcing them as objectively as we can. Again not perfectly, as long as humans are involved in moderation it can never be truly objective, but we have have a doubt or question we discuss amongst ourselves and try to come an agreement, which is what happened here. I know there are a lot of complaints about the sub, but again I think that more due to the person making the complaints mindset. People talk about problems on this subreddit as if they super unique: having nationalists, being so negative, being too liberal, being too conservative, etc, but after being on reddit for a long time and reading many, many subreddits, I think /r/korea is pretty average. People are more focused on /r/korea because they are passionate about the topic, which I think is great, but sometimes we get too far into a topic that we can think about it properly anymore.

Me going no contact really drove the point home. I know most people aren so lucky.

Other team is burying every single shot, defense is very difficult rn, and whenever I run my guy into an opposing player he gets the ball checked out. Passing feels really good and shooting is satisfying as hell. If I can get the hang of it it's seems like it'll be really fun

In fact, each generation seems to breed stronger players than the last, mostly due to how much tougher it is to survive in poker with each passing year.

But the problem here is that neither Cotto nor Pacquiao are currently donning title straps. It would be a non title bout, and the only person that benefits from this fight is, you guessed it, Bob Arum.

In her biography, The First Lady, April Ashley quotes her ex husband, the late Hon.

No, the reality is we all suffer and worry, and in most cases "being happy" is only a temporary reprieve, never a state able to be attained or sustained. Only once we finally accepted that, and stopped trying to aspire to some mystical state of happiness all the time, the sooner we will become kinder to each other.
I also suspect that thinking about having a man around to help care for the kids and manage household chores can help reduce stress for a lot of women. Research shows that women are more likely to experience orgasm if they feel relaxed and free of distractions, while other studies suggest that women report more relationship and sexual satisfaction when their partners help out around the house. And a stay at home dad can be the ultimate helper..

You could think that, but when the score is 2 0 with 10 minutes left of play it doesn make any sense they would all of a sudden become this bad.

You need to find what works for you; if you wake up stiff or sore, it is likely that you are sleeping in a position that is causing the discomfort. Ideally, you want to sleep in a neutral position, with every joint neither stretched nor curled.If you can, learn to sleep on your back! It is the most neutral position (least strain on muscles), and keeps you in good posture (chin tucked, shoulders back, back straight). 
Remember, 70% of the time different players are ready to fold seeking a hand that they think favors them! Now, the thing is to remove the weaklings by aggressively playing and waging with tight bets!

I sure most of them aren in it to look like IFBB pros. Making ANY visible gains at all is difficult, and is something that the vast majority of the population can or won do. For those of us without good genetics, you have to have absolutely everything else running like a well oiled machine if you want to make halfway decent gains. Perfect well tracked diet, heavy intense workouts, and plenty of rest. Your average lazy, unintelligent guy skipping half his workouts and doing chest/arms every day won be able to pull that off. But get him a little gear and he start to look like an above average lifter even though he doesn have a clue what he doing. That why so many of the decent looking guys at the gym open their mouths and the most retarded bro science you ever heard starts coming out. Never take advice from these people.

Having grown up on a farm in Delaware, McNeer got his baptism of fire in finance as a penniless clerk on Wall Street, where he saw the carnage unleashed by the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed.

The point is that there was more consequences to the suit than simply "negating an NDA that was already recinded". If it had gone forward, it could have led to more NDA being invalidated, so the case not going forward keeps the other NDA as they were (which is a bearing on the other NDAs). I will concede though, I could have phrased my origional post better to make it clearer that when I said "getting it thrown out" refered to the court invalidating the NDA, as opposed to "getting it thrown out" referring to the court case.

The study involved 20 subjects with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment who, on separate days, were given either emulsified MCTs or a placebo. The researchers observed a significant increase in blood plasma levels of the ketone body beta hydroxylutyrate (beta OHB) after only 90 minutes of treatment, and depending on the apolipoprotein E genotype of the subject tested, beta OHB levels either continued to rise or held constant between the 90 and 120 minute blood draws in the treatment condition. Remarkably, cognitive testing revealed that this brief MCT treatment facilitated improved performance on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS cog) in 4 subjects within the study group. Moreover, ketone values were associated with greater improvement in paragraph recall with MCT treatment relative to placebo across all subjects (P=0.02). article link below

The technique is not only simple and intuitive; it has sparked a revolution in computer game play of some of the most difficult bluffing games, including clear domination of annual computer poker competitions.Since the algorithm is relatively recent, there are few curricular materials available to introduce regret based algorithms to the next generation of researchers and practitioners in this area.

It just seems like the models themselves haven changed and they not doing much different with the art style to really differentiate it.

I always had lackluster skin, with breakouts here and there, never more than 4 or so pimples at a time. Last February/March I started slowly developing a severe hormonal breakout. I was in denial but it kept spreading like a beard across my face and it was out of my control. If I could go back in time I would have seen my dermatologist months earlier, but I finally made it to one at the end of June. I couldn believe my skin was doing this! I felt so ashamed, I never had blemishes like this as a teenager. I was embarrassed and resented all my friends with clear skin and felt patroniZed when they called me beautiful. It felt like wearing a mask I couldn take off, and I still struggle with this despite my progress. Acne totally fucked with my identity. I hope this post encourages people to persist and be consistent with treatment because visible results can take so long to see. It took me five months to finally admit that I look different. I don have to convince myself that it feels different or that "maybe my breakouts are slowing down." I finally see it. I can objectively see it.

That's what I've seen, at least, from the people I know on the left. Maybe it's just because they're younger, but they definitely care more about physical things.

Shakespeare, I can read fluently. Of course I have to look up words and spend a lot more time on the text in order to get the subtleties, but that mostly because, well, it Shakespeare.

For example, "That's a nice car!" which could be answered with a simple "yes, it is," for most people and they'd let it go, unless they have something else to say about it. He replied with "Hey?" to which you have to respond with a more elaborate "Yes, it's a great car, I really like the colour," or something, and if you don't he just keeps going "Hey? Hey? Are you even listening to me?" and if you do answer he still replies with "Hey?" and expects you to come up with yet another thing to say about the car.

Anyone who is still operating under the delusion that the Obama administration is not part of the old boys club that is the G 20 should wake up and smell Summers, who has the distinct odor of all the rotten and decaying lies that created the deregulation of banking, the gutting of the public sector in the name of the "free market," and the G 20 save the banks, screw the people policies.

Lex is right that it a great fold but i think it can be unpacked and understood in hindsight, especially if the guy has been playing fairly tight (i don know his image). He never getting called by worse hands and he not getting much better to fold since he can rep the straight because he have bet it on the flop to protect his equity. He can rep a flush by check shoving the river either because no sane person would do that on a paired board with the flush ace out there severely reducing the spade hands he could have, given that he 3 bet pre flop. And he really can rep a full house that isn Kings full or aces full because KQ would bet the flop, as would 99, for similar reasons a flopped straight would: equity protection.

I actually thought a lot about adding additional mods or users with access to the gmail account, or verifying in a totally different way. I keep coming back to the basic idea that I would hate for people information to get abused when they submit their credentials.

No one been signed up for spam email through this process, or had their identity stolen, or been blackmailed based on the information they provided.

R4: (at 3:29) The creator of this video makes the bold claim that second person pronoun "you" derives from a misspelling by german printing presses of the word "thou/ou" because they did not have the appropriate letter for thorn and had substituted it with "y", hence "ou > you" which "was kept [.] in pronunciation for some reason" (their words). They make reference for "ye" in "ye olde" as an example of this and while this indeed the case for the definite article in "Ye Olde", this is only true for speakers of Modern English due to its anachronistic use in culture and language. This is not the case for "you", which in fact, is the oblique form of the archaic nominative, plural, second person pronoun "ye" and, as with many European languages of the time, plural personal pronouns were considered more polite and formal, while "thou" the singular pronoun, was considered informal and familiar.

Yes! Changing Environments co founder Sandra Richter told me I could expect a charging time comparable to plugging it in "at home or Starbucks.'' My iPhone was at 55 percent power when I started charging. It was at 61 percent about 10 minutes later. Now, this was an entirely unscientific process   iPhone charge times can vary depending on the model, battery percentage and if you're using a wall charger or charging it through your computer   but I think waiting 10 minutes for an 11 percent boost is reasonable.

"Some day soon, perhaps in forty years, there will be no one alive who has ever known me. That when I will be truly dead   when I exist in no one memory.

When that person dies, the whole cluster dies, too, vanishes from the living memory. I wonder who that person will be for me. Whose death will make me truly dead?"
