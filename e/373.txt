Perhaps it is the result of economic collapse and military quagmires? the same forces that push Tea Party members to rage against big government push journalists to express anxiety about collapsing sexual borders? Olympic athletes can be both amazingly strong and disciplined and gay men, then how do we mark gay men as "weak" and straight men as "strong"? soldiers are allowed to have desires for humans rather than for the "opposite" sex, then how can masculinity and femininity be upheld? all, when the homosexual was invented, s/he was invented as a gender invert  a feminine man or masculine woman. If a soldier can be a masculine man in love with another masculine man? entire sex/gender system, what queer theorist Judith Butler calls "the heterosexual matrix," collapses. What if hot starlets have hot female lovers? can they be "sexy" and "feminine" and also lesbian if lesbians are imagined as masculine to keep straight women girlie?.

I personally think it's a horrible decision to decrease influence, especially with Russian and Chinese spending and investment in the Middle East and Africa increasing their influence.

Let's pick on those things and not create false blame.

Ultimately, I agree with your goals: we need to abandon for profit healthcare, move away from private insurers to a single payer system, and address lobbyists and money in politics. However, I do not agree with your assessment that both sides are equally responsible and equally incapable of effecting the change we both support. Premiums rise for a variety of reasons, but the ACA was designed to curb premium costs through Medicaid expansion (to allow the government to cover the highest risk patients based on poverty, not age and disability), subsidies (both to patients and to insurers), and by offering a competing market option through the federal healthcare marketplace. The funding for the subsidies and Medicaid expansion would mostly come from additional taxes on the wealthy and a variety of surcharges and excise taxes on a variety of goods and services.
At the end of the year tally a percentage of your meal expenses, auto expenses, travel expenses, and anything else you would consider that might go towards your s Corp startup.

As long as your personal taxes "Corp loan" lines up with your Corp tax filings you should be good as corps hardly ever get audited. At some point you can close the Corp because all that research led you to believe your business model wasn't going to work, and now you have a new and better business model. Rinse and repeat.

Then you have him being a master swordsman/warrior who led the Tyrell force that lifted the Blackwater siege, training against 3 men in the yard because battles aren 1 on 1, etc.

PokerStars is only good for there MTT Playing cash there is bogus, no rakeback and the toughest pools of players. They will eventually be beaten by 888 or party poker, my bet would be PP. Party Poker is going in the direction of being the next good guy, offering 20% 35% rakeback paid out every Monday. Also offering $2.20 sattelite tickets every day with a click and collect system which goes up to 10k packages. So it essentially the chest system without the need of playing daily there. The only thing that sucks there as a grinder is no table selection, but I think that is a good way to go for recreational players because you don have sharks with scripts automatically sitting beside you and crushing you for your money before you even realize what going on. PokerStars is fucking bogus they even decided to not show you the rake being taken from the MTT in the tourney lobby, you have to onto the fine print to find that. Before you know it there going to be taking a bigger rake there to. All it going to take is 1 or 2 big pushes from PP or 888 and it over for stars and I can wait for the day it happens.

Switching from Clarinet to SaxophoneMany beginning students who want to play saxophone are instructed to begin on clarinet, because clarinet was thought a better all around instrument than sax: it was more intellectual (that is, classical) and offered more of a 'challenge'. The saxophone was originally reserved just for people who couldn't succeed on clarinet (which is more difficult to learn the fingerings for). Today, some children are still dissuaded from beginning on saxophone; the excuse being that the saxophone is too big for children to get a good grasp on, while the clarinet is deemd by some to be a better size..

I was recently rereading the books, and one thing I noticed this time around is that, while a lot of Fellowship is third person limited perspective where we know the thoughts of Frodo most often, but not of others. But in Two Towers, that shifts: we almost never know Frodo thoughts, and instead we always in Sam mind when we following that group of characters. But because it all still third person limited, it a subtle shift. But it also a good example of the actual technique Tolkien is using that makes Sam the main character.

I had a good talk with my guy last night about it, and he was so relieved when I explained that NO, I not talking about a big affair when I say I want something memorable, I saying I want our best friend band to play a couple of cover songs (which they do) and flowers from our neighbors garden (which they offered), and that I can start making perogies now and fill up our freezer for midnight snacks, and that we can get the super cheap tiny seniors centre hall that a block from our house so it easy to coordinate (but if we want it we gotta book it now cuz it books over a year in advance). 
The "dead money squeeze" is a common way that poker cheats work. Let say Guy A has a good hand. He signals to his partner, Guy B, who has random garbage. Guy B raises the pot, which gets other players to call. Then Guy A re raises. The pot is now bigger than it would have been had Guy B been playing straight, since he would have never raised without Guy A signal. Guy A now can win a much larger pot with his good hand and split the money with Guy B later on.
The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, passed barely in time to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, provides meager cause for rejoicing.

This sort of warfare is extremely old, though the name is not, being about 150 years old. These soldiers were forward combat engineers, and had training across a number of different areas they were responsible for many technical chores, like building (and blowing up) bridges, laying/clearing minefields, general demolition, defense construction, and, of course, fighting. It could be a tremendously difficult job, unimaginable.

It was part of a teacher job to put the kids in line. But this has gone by the wayside as younger parents and the Ministry of Education have determined that teachers are no longer to use any sort of punishment.

A whole pack of mushers are now on the trail between Ophir and Iditarod, including Mitch Seavey who finally in the top ten. Several were resting together, including Joar until Nic came through and Joar took out after him. Martin Buser, a four time winner, is one of the mushers on that stretch of trail, but he the only one who hasn taken his 24 yet. This means that despite currently being fourth in mileage, he going to lose that position as soon as he stops for his 24 (probably in Iditarod), as other teams pass him. This shuffling around is pretty normal, which is why you can always trust the current frontrunner, but it a good sign he probably won win!

There is one final point for e commerce that needs to be made. E commerce allows people to create completely new business models. In a mail order company there is a high cost to printing and mailing catalogs that often end up in the trash. There is also a high cost in staffing the order taking department that answers the phone. In e commerce both the catalog distribution cost and the order taking cost fall toward zero. That means that it may be possible to offer products at a lower price, or to offer products that could not be offered before because of the change in cost dynamics.

Roller Massage: If you're sitting at home with your shoes off, place a rolling pin under one foot. Roll back and forth on the pin with that foot; then do the same with the other foot. This is a way of giving yourself a foot massage without pulling your feet into your lap or getting down on the floor. If you like this, you might even take a rolling pin to the office; then, several times throughout the day, take your shoes off and "roll" the tension out of your feet. This "roller massage" will also work with a tall, narrow bottle. Some people use smaller "rollers" including golf balls and even marbles.

Ok. What am I actually looking for here though? Pulling fuses and see when the radio dies? On which fuse should it die, though? I simply connected the ISO (ISO 10487 in case American cars don have the standardised car radio connector and you have no idea what I talking about) to the ISO Sony connector and plugged that into the radio.

I accidentally did that since the converter cable is set up like that but offers a way to switch those 2 around which I did once I realised my clock is resetting every time I turn off the car.

I honestly wouldn put my children through what I experienced. I don need to raise them IN an enclave, just within reach of one. I spent my elementary school years in San Diego (we had 99 Ranch back then but none of the surrounding restaurants that have sprung up over the past decade) and I think that gave me some perspective, since my neighborhood was relatively diverse w/ Asian, Hispanic, and a few white families. I also briefly lived in Sacramento, in a neighborhood that was predominantly black, Asian, and Hispanic and I think that helped as well. Lack of diversity (either way) leads to lack of awareness.

People make fun of gingers because it doesn fucking matter. People always think gingers are better than others because everyone else gets glossed over. Standing out in the crowd is bad? being ignored as one of the crowd is worse. At least you can put uniqueness to use. Chicks dye their hair red so that men like them more. People want to be red headed and they make fun of natural redheads, because they enjoy that automatic handout of popularity that nobody else seems to get. Part of me thinks it may be jealousy, and that probably a big element of it. It like someone going, "oh no, these jewels and golden bars hurt when I sleep on them".

Technologies such as virtual reality, wearables and the internet of things (IoT), hyped for years, have yet to reach their full potential. But with 5G rolling out this year, and more widely in 2020, those technologies will see a resurgence. Perhaps this time they'll live up to their initial promise.

First thing people gonna notice is the sample size. 14K hands is a not a enough sample size. When I played 10NL, I was at +9.5BB/100 over 145K hands. Even though I never really went on a real down swing, I had a 20K hands break even stretch. That being said, looks like you on a right track. I think that a good thing having your red line negative, meaning that you under bluffing and take villains to value town. This is the generally a solid strategy to beat micros. Just keep putting in the hours til 100K hands, and you know where you stand.

It all started last autumn when Katie Waldegrave, a social entrepreneur, and I set up Now Teach. We were sure there were lots of fiftysomethings who wanted to teach, but no one was seeking them out. Of the 35,000 who started teacher training in the UK last year, almost none of them a mere 100 were over 55. Given that teachers, on average, last barely five years in the profession, and given that many driven 50 year olds will work into their seventies, this makes no sense at all. What is madder still is that the subjects where the teacher shortage is worst maths, science and languages are things many of these people are good at.

Over the past few years, we moved aggressively to make Coors Light more premium, which is the right thing to do. But we lost ourselves a bit along the way. We moved too far from the core of what makes us recognizable as the World's Most Refreshing Beer, and we gave up some of our relevance in drinkers' lives.
That was at the Waahi P poukai in Huntly. I handed over the first official copy to Kngi Tuheitia and wandered around the back of the whare where a big crowd was gathering.

This was on a fairly obviously anti law enforcement sub so I wanted to put it here and get some LEO perspectives on the content of the video.

Also, none of them caught drug charges (not sure why this would happen, but especially on crazy scenes like that one, things get forgotten/missed). In the end, a "usable" amount of meth isn a huge thing (its illegal, but it hardly reason to use force, unless the subject starts resisting etc.) I just know based on experience that drugs and warrants were the reasons behind the pretext of this traffic stop, so it should be noted that drugs were indeed located.

Imagine how medicine would have developed if we had full body scans and fMRI before we had germ theory. 4 points  submitted 2 months ago

Instead, they say "I don't find black women (as a whole) attractive" because in their minds, this is what black women are. The commenters here are patting themselves on the back and letting out sighs of relief because they "aren't racist, they just can't help who they're attracted to" while turning around and blaming their lack of attraction on what boils mostly down to stereotypes and poor perceptions of black women.

You don end up with Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts as your premium new additions (to an already bad team) if you a good poker player.You don tolerate Bonds ridiculousness for the last three years (when he was no longer worth the silliness) without being money around the industry.But I got to figure even Brian Sabean and Peter Magowan are smart enoughnot tototally wimp out now.They canhold the line at $8 or $ 9 million, with incentives to get it to $14 million if Bonds finds the will to stay awake through all nine innings in 130 games.Without any other offers, I wouldn go above $5 million, with incentives to get himpossibly to $8 million, but I not co depedent with the guy, so Peter andBriancan onlydo what their consciences allow.But if they think Giant fans would be upset with them if they give Bonds a one day (TODAY!!!), $8 million, take it or leave it offer and Bondsdelays think they wrong.I think the Bay Area would understand that. I think it would be refreshing.

Of course it all sounds so simple, I wish it were so simple. I think it also depends on what you mean by "figuring yourself out." As humans we are constantly changing and evolving, so the "figuring out" aspect of our lives is likely always to continue. I don think that you should beat yourself up if you can figure it out, everything takes time and as I said before, I think it a constant process.

I have a ridiculously over the top headcanon to compensate for this, given that in the DoTD novelisation, 9 smashed mirrors in an effort to never have to see his own gaze. I can totally see 9 travelling around for hundreds of years refusing to see himself, until finally feeling confident that maybe he saved enough people to make up for the lives he took that day and earned his old life back. Still wrestling with the idea, he takes little steps to force himself into giving in to the desire, one of which would be to finally see himself, breaking that one little rule that holding him back.

My mother in law got me an Ancestry DNA test for Christmas 2017.

We got to the massage   he did my neck/shoulders/lower back from the back, and when I turned to face up, he did my neck/shoulders from the front. He also did my pecs again when I pointed to the spot of tension near my armpit. He then offered to massage my sternum again, and I think he still had me draped at that point but I definitely felt like one or both of my breasts were being exposed slightly from beneath the sheets. Again, I thought I was just imagining it and didn want to awkwardly open my eyes to check since he was right above me. Now I think he was just testing the waters to see if I would react, because he then proceeded to remove the sheets completely without asking me and left my breasts and stomach completely exposed. Only my panties and down were draped.
