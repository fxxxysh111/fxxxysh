So it checked to you on the flop and you bet $55, get one caller. Now you have a good sense of villain range (he has medium overpairs, a few slow played sets, and crying called smaller PPs, and maybe A9s), and when you pick up great equity on the turn you can check it back, folding on the river when you don improve. 
The prosecutor is usually willing to offer you a deal in exchange for a guilty plea and will almost certainly offer you some kind of reduction at this point. If you like the deal they are offering you can accept it. Once you accept the deal you will be called up in front of the Justice of the Peace and asked if you are willing to plead guilty to the reduced charge, if you say yes the JP will rubber stamp the deal and that will be that..

So I have a dumb ass question  I only just got around to watching Avengers: Infinity war because. I dunno. Anyway, why was thanos like physically stronger than hulk at the start? That seemed really outrageous. Was there something wrong with hulk or is thanos just that strong? It seems lame to have a character both physically insanely strong and then have god like magic strength as well, what is hulk if not physically stronger than everyone? I not even a hulk fan but if I was I literally quit marvel forever. Josh Brolin as Thanos was incredible and the character is cool but he definitely should be less physically strong than hulk.

Much the same is true in business. At times you will need to play loose and aggressive, and sometimes you may be required to play tight.

I used to go to a Korean middle school so physical punishment for any bad behavior was expected. One day a few kids were talking in class so our ass of a math teacher decided that we somehow all deserved to get punished. He told us to kneel on our desks and started hitting us on the thigh one by one. We all complained but figured we just get it done with and get back to class. But one of my classmates completely snapped. He pulled out a knife from his pocket(idek why he had one) and put it towards the teachers throat and threatened to kill him. At that moment I was genuinely afraid I was about to witness a murder and was scared but for some reason every single one of my classmates was laughing at this situation. I still don understand why. But thankfully there was no murder;the kid just ran off to the front office bc he realized he fucked up and came back begging for forgiveness.

As soon as she agreed, I went over to my buddies and told them we need to organize a happy hour at the hotel lobby bar to meet and greet all the new students. They readily agreed. Long story short: I walked with her over there, about 16 of us gave that bar all the business it could handle, and I chatted up that lovely young lady and got her drunk on pitchers of cold beer. Afterward, I walked her over to the nearest el train stop and waited with her for a southbound Purple line train. And there, in the dim light of the Foster Street el stop, I kissed her for the very first time.

The list of piecemeal revisions to our understanding of the practical realities of these later centuries is very long, but the general trend has been to overturn the image of the Ottoman Empire as a state in decay. The various transformations that the empire experienced over the course of its long history need to be understood in light of their own particular contexts, not in light of an outcome   the fall of the empire   that was in many cases hundreds of years in the future..

It not that far fetched a political strategy. been around at least since the Decembrists (no, not the Indie rock group  the Russian upstarts of the 1800s). Yet bombing the indivduals responsible is still the tactic of revolutionary groups. States and state like entities, like the US or Al Qaeda, prefer to bomb innocent civilian populations. although this is a tactic of power, it is really not a great way to get people on your side. when the powerless start taking out the individuals (and perhaps their families) who directly profit from the greed that is the oil industry, something revolutionary is afoot.

The next day I road to Regina, where I met up with some guys that hooked me up with a ton of free beers after hearing about me hitting a deer. From Regina I drove to Thunder Bay. For the last 2 hours of this riding day it was dark and tons of moose and deer were scene along the road edge, so I tucked in behind an 18 wheeler and stayed close. Figured it was a big animal barricade. A deer I could handle, a moose I would have to ditch the bike.

There are many reasons why people have sexual intercourse   it improves intimacy between a couple by releasing hormones that help them bond, and studies have shown that sexual activity relieves stress, boosts immunity, reduces pain and burns calories [source: Doheny].

But whoever owns it at the time of that photo, I assume not the woman pictured since her apparel is more of the "I need a mixte frame" variety, had the good sense to slap a board on it, adding to its already considerable heft.

Just terrible..

We will discuss what hands can be played from each position under a variety of circumstances in the next few sections. You should refer to these sections often and eventually memorize them as you gain experience. As with everything in poker, rarely is any decision set in stone. The following pages contain solid guidelines to help you understand what to look for in each position. Many things will go into each decision you make, such as who enters the pot before you, if the pot has been raised, how loose or tight the other players are, and your table image. What is important to remember is that these guidelines are a good starting point, but through experience you will tweak them to best fit your playing style. Move on to the next section to get started.
Begin to rough dry your hair. Turn your hairdryer to the medium heat setting (the high setting is usually too hot for anything but extremely thick, coarse hair) and begin to roughly dry your hair, using only your fingers. This will speed up the blowout and prevent excess pulling with the hairbrush.
Quand bien mme  le parfum reste la mtaphore de la conversion de l'humain en divin  (4), certaines cultures furent moins coercitives que les Grecs de l'Antiquit.

I worked in administration for one in the 90s and had my children in them for daycare and various preschool programs for a few years. Back then, they were very well run. Accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, which had much higher standards than state regulations. Higher child/caregiver ratios. Frequent training, tuition reimbursement for employees, much higher pay than in the civilian world so that there was little employee turnover, a ton of oversight. All of this was done in response to how crappy childcare was in the 80s and how many joint military couples, working spouses, and single parents were in the military. One of my jobs was to go to all the rooms hourly and go over the logs and verbally confirm feedings, bathroom breaks, diapers changes. I also checked bottles in the refrigerators, and did spot checks to make sure that the correct bottles were being fed to the right babies, and also checking to see if the amount of bottles in the cubbies matched the documented feedings. It was very serious business. I had to fire someone for feeding the wrong bottle to a kid, and it was immediate, she was gone. We had ample staffing so that if there were any issues, we could replace a caregiver in minutes. All of these things and more were in every standard operating procedure for every CDC around the world. I wonder what the fuck happened that so many are now being investigated???

Its totally fair to be turned off by gay sex or straight sex respectively. Unfortunately far to many gay people are like that guy you talked about, where they forgotten how to have a personality, and they make everything about their sexuality. Sex is very deeply engrained in gay culture (which as an aside, i reside a deep burning hatred for, despite being bi), and guys like that make up for being vapid, uninteresting people, by having sex as much as possible, talking about it always, flaunting their sexuality as often and loudly as possible, and screaming about being oppressed in some way, all of this aside from being as flamboyant as possible. The very same people are the type to tell you you aren allowed to dislike gay sex, or say that "everyone is a little gay." In an attempt to get you in bed after you say no.

This is a long story of its own but to put it simply, North Korea refused low level talks because it sensed that they could get a better deal by one on one talking with Trump himself. The US chief nuclear negotiator Stephen Biegun was only able to begin talks with NK this year after months of NK reluctance   and the resulting prep time was very short. 
The June date being a reference to Obergefell, when the Supreme Court forced the legality of same sex marriage in every state. Reading a book prominently recognizing lynchings in the south, reading about how in 1963, while searching for the corpses of 3 civil rights activists the search party stumbled across the lynched corpses of 8 unreleated black men pounded home the hell out of the pervasiveness of racism helped me formulate my thoughts on how ludicrous it is to think legal changes ended racism and its impact on politics, the notion that anti LGBT bigotry ended with Obergefell is ludicrous.
The court information listing the murder charges points to the deaths occurring on or about Oct. 30, five days before the bodies were found in Middlesex County near the Oneida Nation of the Thames community.

However, the difference is that two stacks unidirectionally shifts the power in players favor by making advantage with rollers always hit (save with curses). By the time players have rolling modifiers they mostly have steady access to advantage, as well as higher level cards and a thin, mean attack deck. Monsters can gain any such advantages, and these combined points are why I argue that not gaining check marks has a smaller impact on overall balance.. 
I suppose this particular execution of this particular type of party is rather insensitive, perhaps gauche.

Once I got back to seriously training most of my strength came back within a couple months and I was matching or beating my old numbers within 6 months. I suppose my fuckaround training helped me maintain some semblance of strength, but I felt like I made a lot of progress really quickly when I could focus on it again since I already had a base of strength..

I think that people get this argument all wrong. The argument isn that it isn possible to get out of poverty through hard work and smarts. The argument is that there are systemic issues that make it so only certain groups have to do that. Middle to upper class white people don have to work hard or be particularly smart to stay out of poverty (I am one, although I like to tell myself I am smart and hard working). For people in poverty, it is a huge life changing amount of work and effort, they have to break expectations and do it all without any support. For people who aren poor, it just normal life, it isn particularly hard, they have plenty of support.
While we didn follow a script in terms of dialogue (most of that was ad libbed by the cast), we did have a very specific shooting schedule for the day, shot scenes out of order, and had one or more story arcs to follow for each episode. 
We gone several times during the soft opening in early December. The food is great, the staff are friendly, the space is open and clean. The only gripe we have is that over several visits we never saw an improvement in speed of service. I totally understand opening kinks, but one expects them to be worked out over the course of a month. Each time we there (with one exception when we were the only customers) the service is very slow with long spells of empty beer glasses. Also, three weeks in, they were still passing around a single piece of paper with the beer list or letting you read their list written on the back of their order pads. I kept hearing the reason was that their printer was broken. Seems like a quick trip to FedEx Office, Staples or UPS Store to make some copies would have been an easy and quick fix.

As I've explained to you by email and had already posted notes to say this would happen, just to reiterate; the Forum has finite capacity, with so many IM threads appearing it was becoming unwieldy and dominated by IM chat, not something all our members are interested in.

Note that any small business involves some amount of risk that the business could fail and the owner could go broke. So while risking a large bankroll as a professional poker player might not be like going to a 9 to 5 job and getting a paycheck every week, it is a lot like opening a restaurant and hoping that it won't be one of the 60% that fail. And it's actually less risky in some ways, because it's relatively easy for a small business to operate on credit, whereas poker players usually use their own money for their bankroll, so poker players can at least just walk away and not worry about direct effects on their debt or credit rating.. 
Drug addict, high on opiates used an exacto knife to cut between the shaft of the penis and the inside of his cock head. Essentially making it so the head was separate from the main structure of the shaft, but was still connected by tissues at the tip, kind of like when a strong wind turns an umbrella inside out. He then used those low quality rough brown paper towels you see in public restrooms, and stuffed it underneath the partially degloved head to stem the blood flow.

I recognize that my summaries aren going to reach everyone, but I feel it my duty to at least try to do something positive.
NTA   Are you just supposed to sit there while he gives your girlfriend a teddy bear, very clearly trying to steal her from you? Of course not. I mean, ideally, she would have stepped up and been more forcefully clear with the guy, but for anyone who had their hearts broken, I can sympathize with her not wanting to bring that pain on someone else. But the fact of the matter is that sometimes you just have to, and she really should have by politely refusing to accept the gift. Anyways, assuming that she really isn into him, then you did her a favour here.

Metroid Fusion (GBA)Still a good game, but a big disappointment after playing ZM. I don't mind linear games but in that case I really prefer it if it just cut out the exploring and backtracking altogether and stuck to a stage based structure. Pacing felt off with the constant data room visits.

Nothing like living in a high rent building and playing the "can I use my front door or is the dealer and his pit bulls in the way" game, or "whose turn it is this time to call the cops on the meth heads blasting their stereo/abusing a guitar and wailing at the top of their lungs outside your window at 3:00 AM."

From what I learned in my Physical Geography class (and from watching a lot of Bill Nye as a kid), the Winter Solstice is the day in which the Northern Hemisphere experiences its shortest day of the year.

I do not mean to advocate the use of aluminum in vaccines, and I wish there were a better alternative out there, but the amount of aluminum in a vaccine is less than our average daily intake and certainly cannot be considered sufficient reason to abandon the only way of protection we have. As to what I have to worry about, I would think the answer would be obvious: Infants. Vaccines are not magic. As I mentioned before, it takes multiple shots over years for them to work, and children are more susceptible to diseases by default.

It's so hammered into us that people don't mean what they say that many women can't really accept a blunt answer because it's so simple.

If ads were different colors on different subs, that might confuse normal users. And making an entire color off limits is pretty restrictive, if you blocked only the exact color then you could still use a shade similar to it, and if you block all similar shades then mods could no longer use an entire category of colors. If promoted posts were a mute shade, like a light gray ish blue, I think that could probably work without restricting mod color options.. 
As the world currently is, not how it will be when the kid is almost 40, getting a driver license is sort of a right of passage. Not to mention the stress it will relieve from the mom and dad not having to drive the kid everywhere.

Drawing what you're being told to draw for 3 4 years leaves you in a mental state that's like getting pulled into a black hole with no direction, nor the energy needed to get out.

I think that you should consider counselling or speaking to a psychologist. You shouldn't be afraid to be in your own home. Anxiety and stress wear on you quickly and make it harder for you to be the mum that your DD needs. Speaking to a professional will help you develop the mental tools that you need to deal with your MIL without losing your mind. They will also be able to provide you with an outside opinion from someone who is looking out for your best interests.

They say the restaurant's founder, Louis Lassen, was actually the first to flip beef patties onto bread back in 1900.

I don't think it makes a lot of sense that an individual could go on for very long with intestinal damage without developing some symptoms.
