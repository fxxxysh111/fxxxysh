As far as education, I was well informed enough both as a kid (though the significance didn hit me then) and as an adult, I asked lots of questions, got like 5 different doctors for opinions.
Bodies of water seem to have held some spiritual significance, probably being seen as liminal spaces between the physical world and supernatural otherworld. We can assume this based on votive offerings left in lakes, ponds and rivers across Celtic speaking temperate Europe, where expensive objects like swords, jewelry, even purpose made silver model boats were just dumped into the water. This indicates that bodies of water were likely seen as places where the lines between natural and supernatural were blurred, where the gods and men (deuogdonoi in Gaulish) could come into contact, with the intent of currying favours with divine powers by leaving them a sacrifice. It probably safe to say that there was no "pan Celtic" religion with some strict pantheon of gods and heroes, but that divinities were probably associated with different aspects in different regions and maybe even called different names. Nor was there some codified religious scripture despite the fact that druids seem to have existed as some interregional religious political order between Gaul, Britain and Ireland (Caesar mentions the institution of druids was invented in Britain and spread to Gaul, and that some Gaulish druids would travel there to receive instruction). This is just a really long way of saying "we really don know anything but there a couple things we can infer from linguistic and archaeological evidence".
Samurai I used to box when I was a kid and now I practise t chi. When you get to a certain level you allowed to buy a samurai sword: it part of the training. I bought one online (pictured) and when it arrived there was a little bit of chalk with it, shaped like a lollipop. 
Well said, one model I have seen among some people that married young is for the wife to be a SAHM first and then go on to pursue education and career once the kids are older. not a bad model.
Hurricane Katrina History and Effects The devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina temporarily wiped most of Biloxi away in August 2005. At the time the casinos were situated on floating barges, and all but the Beau Rivage were completely destroyed. The casinos were quickly rebuilt, and a new state law allowing them to be built on land within 800 feet of the shoreline should help to lessen future hurricane damage to the resorts. 
But the efforts do actually have to be meaningful. 
I mean, you're free to do whatever you want, that's your right. But God forbid, imagine you die tomorrow and someone has to go through all of your possessions as part of the estate. Is it unfathomable that person might mistake it for a toy? I'd say it's very possible.

Seconding this. I'm injured now and out for what's looking like 6 weeks (hello cross training!), but leading up to my injury I'd get horribly nervous the day before/day of hard workouts, despite always doing rather well in them and having no real reason to get nervous. With the perspective the injury has given me so far, I was putting too much pressure on myself (mentally and physically), and that perfectionism made me sort of lose the fun part of training.

We are what we are and if we need an Ag school to provide our future farmers an education I rather have that than worry about Academic Rankings but really if we didn have that we probably be a lot higher.

Our Agriculture stuff is good too but I imagine academically that weighs us down.

The PPA has been active on Capitol Hill since 2005, and vaulted to prominence in the wake of the UIGEA's passage. It counts 1.2 million members, rents a booth at CPAC and spent $1.8 million on lobbying expenditures in 2010. Since its founding, its PAC has doled out $285,000 to members of Congress, Pappas says. "The PPA has argued as an organization for a long time, and tried to let the poker community know, that the status quo was probably not tenable," he says. "Either legislatively or legally, someone was going to try to restrict their right to play even further. government was issuing the licenses and making this clearly legal."

The conservative Koch brothers were behind it. So was the liberal Center for American Progress and just about every advocacy group in between. Polls show the concept has broad public support.

I once worked at a company that had a delivery guy who owned a racecar, one that he worked on in his garage and raced at the local oval track on weekends. One day he decided he take it for a quick test drive down the street and back just as a quick shakedown on some transmission work he had done, and wouldn you know a cop saw him and pulled him over. I can even tell you all of the violations he was hit with (I know there was speeding, something about bumpers, exhaust noise, no plates or registration, no brake or indicator lights, etc) but it was enough moving violations that he got 12+ points on the spot and immediately lost his license for 6 months. Then of course he took a pretty nasty hit to his auto insurance rates as well, and lost his job because he could drive for 6 months and even if he had a license our insurance wouldn cover him behind the wheel.

If two or three players are left after the Turn, it is likely that the hand will not go to a show down. Often the more aggressive player will push the others off their hands, forcing them to fold by betting big.

So it checked to you on the flop and you bet $55, get one caller. Now you have a good sense of villain range (he has medium overpairs, a few slow played sets, and crying called smaller PPs, and maybe A9s), and when you pick up great equity on the turn you can check it back, folding on the river when you don improve. (Unless you have a really strong read on villain and believe you can move him off his pair with another bullet on the turn)..

While much of Phuket is overbuilt, the JW Marriott, the island's newest luxury resort, faces ten miles of Mai Khao beach that will never be developed because they're part of the Sirinath Marine National Park, the protected breeding grounds of endangered leatherback turtles.

Two straight guys saying they are going to "rape" each other in a computer game isn politically incorrect because there a very little chance of the literal act actually taking place; just like two white people saying they are going to lynch one another, it isn politically incorrect. But saying you are going to "rape" a girl in jest is indeed being a misogynist because the vast majority of rape cases over our history as a society have been enacted on woman. Just like saying in jest that you going to lynch your black friend might get you in trouble, because of the historical significance of said act upon said people :)

When I was about 15, this group of boys in my year used to get a lot of fun out of asking me rude questions, like if I watched porn or stuff like that. Their ringleader was this absolute turd of a Young Tory with hair like Jedward who didn think Gypsies Allowed signs in cafes were racist because like, pollute the planet, and stuff No, I am not kidding. Yes, I did go to private school.. 
I ended up spinning it up in a docker container   the unifi controller container eats 520MB of ram and that just with a single AP.Docker containers usually have a little overhead, and that docker host isn exactly short on ram, but still. 520MB is pretty ridiculous for what it does.adrenaline_X  2 points  submitted 4 days agoI went from running the whole it infrastructure for a medium sized business with one jr support guy to working for a very large enterprise.I miss interacting with all my former co workers and the friends we made.

While they were grateful about the pricing, it was the fact that the Metal 12 Row Casino Table Chip Tray with Cover and Lock came with a lock and key. I actually bought it because of the size, but it did make sense that they wanted to keep everything safe just in case something were to happen. In the end, it became one of the pieces of the puzzle that volunteers needed to make sure they did while using the poker chips..

I was in hopes this would have had some good effect, but the event did not prove it, for we had not been long from the Tent before the natives again began to gather about, and one of them more daring than the rest pushed one of the Centinels down, snatched the Musket out of his hand and made a push at him, and then made off, and with him all the rest.

If this cop had at the very least not been a condescending prick about the entire thing it wouldn't be so bad, but him scoffing at the mere idea that THC was helping a cancer patient, something that is scientifically proven to be true, shows that he doesn't give respect. He's just another one of those jumped up assholes who thinks that everyone should kneel down and blow them because of the job they made the personal choice to take. I chose to do cocaine, I expect no sympathy nor hate for that, only for my actions that effected others, which luckily are minimal (as I stated I never had to steal or anything, but I used some choice words to people who tried to get me to quit).

Carter observed that in general, participants paid more attention to their human opponent than their computer opponent while playing poker, which is consistent with humans drive to be social.
IP flatting range preflop should be a good bit wider given Hero 3b sizing, I have some Kings+KQ but I pretty capped. (e: flop call is standard imo just given MDF and how high Q is in our range) Call turn with QJs and let most flop floats go, 7s is super blank obv. On the river It a tough spot, Kx calls obviously and most Qs will be too strong to fold from a theoretical perspective I believe, but I think I let QTs and QJs go at some frequency on the river here just because our range is so hard to defend on this exact board..

This gives you the opportunity to profitably bet medium strong hands you might otherwise have checked. Sometimes a player may even fake a tell, hoping to induce his opponents to make poor judgments in response to the false poker tell.

When it comes to individualized learning paths, the evidence shows that both gifted students and highly motivated students do really well when they are able to learn at their own pace and have some autonomy over their learning, but unmotivated students (who comprise a significant portion of all high school students) do much worse, as it is essentially removing the extrinsic motivators (like social pressure, group work, clear expectations) which at least had them doing the bare minimum.The takeaway here is that education is really, really complicated, and every time you solve one problem you create another.

Consider this description of the protest:
To me, the primary difference in the two albums is one of scope. Everything cascades out from there. When Dawson looks at the medieval world, he focuses on the small dirty villages the majority of people lived in their whole lives. The mud and muck, the community, the creeps, the helplessness, the joy, Peasant tells many stories of many different people. The album zooms in on these slices of life and because of that, the instrumentation zooms in as well. The guitar is loud and chaotic, the chorus vocals slip on and off rhythm, the drums are overblown. The music is right in your face because so are the stories, it messy because so are the stories, it dark and unsettling and folksy because so are these people. In addition, giving one person one song each forces Dawson to cut out much of the other details of that person while also stuffing as much into the song as he can. He gets as much into the zoomed in frame as he can. It why Peasant can sound so wild and bombastic while also being intimate and about community.
How is your fiance going to react when Duke makes your child sick from fecal matter? Or when he too rough and injures them?

Fundamentally, poker is a game of skill and strategy, not a game of pure chance (although luck plays a role). Vonk has always loved games, but his love for poker rests on the combination of "math skills" and "people skills," as he put it. 
20k part time would be $25/hr. At least 99.9% of people that start taking poker seriously in 2019 will never reach that hourly. There are thousands of third world pros grinding out the micros for $1k/month playing full time. They also putting in a shit ton of effort. It still possible to make 100k+/year if you actually dedicated and skilled enough or get access to soft enough games, but you seem to be projecting dollar amounts with no experience on the subject.
Now, just what's the proper bankroll for cash games? Put it to use in this way, if you do not have at the very least 100x the minimum bet or higher for the overall game you're taking into account, then your game isn't for you. The stark the truth is that the chances are against you and you will lose more hands than win. This is exactly why you will have to carefully select which hands you play. I highly suggest playing hands such as for example AA, KK, AQ, 910 SUITED, JK, etc. if you're just starting out. If you want help, there are numerous resources available that you might want to utilize at any time. There are numerous message boards and places where pros will in reality answer your questions for FREE.

No joke. I went at 0957 thinking I be out of there to eat hearty lunch by 1130 1200. I was there until 2 fucking 30. Also, get this, they don allow food or drink including water.

I hadn eaten breakfast that day and maybe had 1.5 cups of coffee.
What I do know is that it is ridiculous for our society to make a bigger deal about dogs, bulls, and whatever animal you like, suffering than the human suffering that goes on everyday as a result of wars, poverty, and crime. How are we ok with allowing the gruesome death of a human to be shown in a movie but not the death of an animal? That is what seams wrong and a little misguided.

You might consider the bar "Mein Haus am See" as its a bit more tourist friendly but still popular. For clubs, Prince Charles like I said (they have concert/ticket DJ nights, so check there), and also Watergate (they have that too).

There are other atomic conjoined terms in this book besides "bomb", and they are somewhat telling of the period. Wells does make a good strike with "atomic bomb", "atomic ammunition", and "atomic power", and then goes on to describe the other bits that could benefit from this atomicity, including "atomic aeroplanes", "atomic hay lorries", "atomic traction engines", "atomic riveters" (riveting at twice the pace of a human), and "atomic smelters". So there are some weak spots here and there in his 57 mentions of "atomic something", and that okay he did some pretty good sightseeing into the future with the bomb..

There are several companies that helped Hitler build his war machine, such as Porsche and Maybach. Were these companies ever assigned blame or did they ever address that fact? It seems funny to me that these companies are successful to this day yet they seem to have a dark spot in history. These companies were by this time multinational corporations with local executives (and this meant locally managed operations) in the areas they operated. Just by virtue of them existing in German territory at the start of the war, it would not have been so easy for these factories not to have been taken over in some capacity. That's not to say, however, that the corporations bore no responsibility for them. Most people knew what the Nazis were about and these corporations had 6 8 years to divest, repurpose, or abandon their German operations.
While yes, the genocide was a military operation, not civilian, ASSK could have publically condemned it. Instead she stuck to the official narrative and denied the whole thing. Why?

But in the same way that eugenics as an ideology can lead to horrible crimes against humanity, eugenics as the basis of health care can lead to many unnecessary deaths.

But you know, intellectually speaking, that your body, posture, says huge amounts. So whenever you realize that something you should be aware of, you are not, just bring it back into your awareness. The key here is that you keep in your conscious awareness everything you think will be important, and have the goals in your mind "make this person laugh", "make this person happy with my talk", "get this person to open up to me".

With a forward line of Mario Balotelli and Antonio Cassano, Italy starting XI might have been picked by Sigmund Freud. Balotelli lectured his team mates, kicked a goal post after missing from three yards out and left the pitch at the interval moaning.

With many people treating their pets more like children and less like animals, there is a growing trend of taking them to places that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. A 2009 AP poll showed that half of all American pet owners considered their pet as much a part of the family as any other person (Another 36 percent said the pet was part of the family but not a full member.)

22, detectives spoke to the 16 year old and his legal guardian, after reading the boy his Miranda rights, according to the affidavit.Collins, in the interview, admitted to picking up a stick, but told investigators he didn't remember what happened after that until he saw Kulpa on the ground and thought, "Oh (expletive)."When asked by a detective how hard he hit Kulpa, on a scale of one to 10, Collins replied, "A six or something; I wanted to knock her out," adding that he did not want to kill her.According to the affidavit, Collins told investigators it was Montgomery's idea to attack Kulpa, and that Montgomery had said, "Let's kill her and take her car." Collins told investigators he chose to use a "blunt object" instead of the axes that were nearby.Collins added that he was "really, really drunk," and that Kulpa "gave me a lot of alcohol and I was stoned as hell." He also said she was hitting on him and was making him uncomfortable, according to the affidavit.But Collins also said, "I shouldn't have done it anyway," and added that, "I did think she was dead," according to the affidavit.Collins told investigators he only struck Kulpa once, although they noted, in the affidavit, that the woman "suffered two very serious injuries to her head."In a short interview at the hospital, Kulpa told investigators she did not remember the assault, only that she had picked up Collins and his friends while they were hitchhiking.While Collins is a juvenile, the Boulder County District Attorney's Office took the rare step of charging him as an adult.Berkenkotter initially prohibited prosecutors from publicly revealing what charges they filed against Collins because the proceedings in the case are temporarily under seal while she considers a defense motion to permanently seal all documents in the case.On Monday, though, District Attorney Stan Garnett released the charges his office filed last week: attempted first degree murder, first degree assault on an at risk person, and two crime of violence sentence enhancers.Collins could face eight to 24 years in prison on the attempted murder charge and 16 to 32 years in prison on the at risk assault charge, Garnett said.The teen remains in custody on $1 million bond and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in February..

Strip poker is just like any other poker game. The difference in playing strip poker is that players strip items of clothing when they lose a bet. Strip poker has been with us for ages, and contrary to popular belief, strip poker is originally not a sensual, erotic game. Poker developed hundreds of years ago, and strip poker originated from the basic game of poker. Because poker enables one to win while others are losing, the losers then can bet their clothing. This is to take back their cash from the winning opponent. Before, items of clothing are considered of special value.

In media, so much of the problem isn't just that people aren't able to pay for what news they would choose to consume, but that we choose to consume news that fails to inform us. Since this is money that counterfactually would have been spent by the government on something else, I think spending it on the average government program is preferable to just funding Breitbart, Fox News, Salon, TYT, etc.
In a tournament situation, frequently by the time you get to a heads up situation pre flop, the blinds are so large that the only decision to make is whether or not to go all in.

Position plays in a heads up situation becomes more complex later in the hand..

It is not uncommon for people to have a non registered company savings plan, a stock savings plan, or other investments they have accumulated outside an RRSP as they approach retirement. This could even include a Tax Free Savings Account. Upon retirement, it can seem counterintuitive to then take RRSP withdrawals when you do not need them and intentionally pay tax. Some retirees would rather defer their RRSP withdrawals until 72, or believe they must wait that long, relying instead on non registered or TFSA savings or their CPP pension to supplement their cash flow in the interim.

Turn the heat up to medium high and sautee all this for a few more minutes until you see a sear on your veggies.Now add your toasted grain back to the pan, add water or stock, cover with a lid, and simmer on low heat or medium low heat until it gets cooked.When cooked, garnish with lots of cilantro or diced scallions or toasted chopped almonds or all of the above!Because the grain is toasted and the veggies are seared separately, the texture will be a whole lot different than a clumpy soggy mass. The grains would be separated and the dish overall would have a lot more texture and "cooked/seared" flavor.Instead of dry toasting, you could also add some oil and sautee it.While academia admittedly has many large flaws and I absolutely didn't have a fun time overall, I do think it was a really amazing learning experience and I think it achieved the goals of the program.

Know your opponents. Everyones chances of hitting a four card open straight is twice as likely, because it has a place open at either end to complete the hand; for example, a hand of 4 5 6 7 can use either a 3 on the left end or an 8 at the other to complete the straight.

He couldn't talk, he pushed my friend who was with me and he had hit his mouth so he was bleeding all over the place. The police came and threatened him, one held him down by his neck and said if he didn't stop moving he'd "break your fucking arms". One cop came up to me and was like "what drugs did he take!?" I said none, we don't do drugs. He persisted and told me he would die if I didn't tell them. But I had nothing to tell. We get to the ER and the cops have worked him up and scared him so badly that the ER drs intubated him for two days. Every time they asked me what happened I explained and every single time they asked me what drugs he took. He was In the hospital for a week and I kid you not when they checked us out I asked about a diagnosis and was told that they didn't have one because we wouldn't tell them what drugs he took. My MIL and BIL are both epileptic and this was my husbands third seizure that someone had witnessed.

In truth we have forsaken the right to call Iqbal our national poet. What commonality is there between his poetry and our way of life? The way our leaders conduct themselves   fawning when they should know better not to, listening to lectures when they should have the wit and understanding to educate foreigners about the reality of Pakistan and its neighbourhood   shows no sympathy or connection with Iqbal. There should be no commemoration of Iqbal Day and no changing of the guard at his tomb   betwixt Lahore's great mosque and the imposing faade of Akbar's fort   until we learn to conduct ourselves with greater national dignity.

My wife, it seems, was brought up to think exactly the opposite: not only does her family appear to think please and thank you are a waste of time, but that the more you know someone, the less you have to say it, because "they should know you well enough to know you appreciate them without you having to use words".

Bottom line is you can give either case benefit of doubt if you view their statements through the lens of geopolitical posturing. The charge that, as you put it, "she WANTED to go to war with Russia." Really? You think she "wanted" it? Literally no one on this planet "wants" that. The idea is stupid on it face and is traceable directly back to Russian state media..

In the 1950s and 60s, many professionals took Wednesday afternoons off and worked Saturday mornings.

Venezuela, Colombia, and Bolivia were all in the midst of political instability, with governments elevated by coup or revolution, and while having no desire to alienate them, for the US to recognize them might give unintended moral aid to the Confederacy. The biggest example is in Caracas.

Given your budget it be hard so you might want to look for a used gun. A Marin lever action .30/30 could probably be found if you look hard enough and will give you the best bang for your buck. Also any bolt action .308 made by Ruger, Savage, Tikka, Mossberg, or Remington will do the trick. Make sure that whatever you buy has sights on it or you gonna have to shell out more money for an optic or iron sights. I also suggest saving a little bit more money so that you can spend around $500 on a rifle. That amount should get you a pretty good package to get started. I see used Remington and Tikkas with scopes on them for $500 at Cabelas all the time

It a beautiful short, as many Pixar productions are, that tells a mother story using the importance of food in Chinese culture. So how is celebrating one background while simultaneously telling a very relatable story about the raising of children in any way propaganda or Chinese soft power?

Doubling up means your wife can use the hormones without worrying a fertilized egg won be able to implant in the thinner endometrium. 
Even when he's not working at all, I'm not allowed to focus on my work. It's so unfair because if I were a man, and my wife weren't working, I would be allowed to expect help. But since I'm not, I have to prioritize his possible future work above my own time. And I have a super high profile job! I'm just so angry all the time. He does clean and do things for the house, but he just says he's not good at taking care of the baby and I am. And when he's not angry at me for not cleaning more while I'm doing all the child care and income generation, he's depressed because he's not where he wants to be in life and literally walking around the house crying so I have two crying boys to deal with. And he sleeps in another room and I'm up half the night every night.

Special shave. Do the shaving for him! This will afford you time to talk to him to let him know how special he is to you and your tender touch on his face as you shave him handsome. Spark up some scented candles or incense for an added sensory pampering.
Single English word adequately captures the full depth, range, and subtlety of the crucial Pali term dukkha. Over the years, many translations of the word have been used ("stress," "unsatisfactoriness," "suffering," etc.). Each has its own merits in a given context. There is value in not letting oneself get too comfortable with any one particular translation of the word, since the entire thrust of Buddhist practice is the broadening and deepening of one understanding of dukkha until its roots are finally exposed and eradicated once and for all. One helpful rule of thumb: as soon as you think you found the single best translation for the word, think again: for no matter how you describe dukkha, it always deeper, subtler, and more unsatisfactory than that. definition:
