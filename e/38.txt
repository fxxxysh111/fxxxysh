To win the pot, that is the objective of the game. There are a couple of ways to do this. One is to have the highest ranking hands, and the other is by bluffing your way into making the other players believe you have the best cards therefore folding.
I say though that the butterfly, the wall split with feet splayed out for external rotation work, the frog pose, and the inclining pancake were all a mainstay in my routine. Notice how I did not include the horsestance. In my own experience, that stretch was good for nothing, so I dropped it. Your mileage may be different, so just experiment!

Pot odds boil down to percentages. The pot must be large enough to pay enough extra on the times you do hit your hand to make up for the losses when you don't. The key is to get your money into the pot when you have the best hand.

Wading through transcripts of the hours of Lane videotaped interviews with police, I linger over the sections where she talks about the man she claims is the father of her second child, Tegan. She describes Andrew Norris as fair haired, tanned, well built and of medium height. She says he lived in the Balmain area in late 1995 and early 1996, when they had a brief affair, and worked in the city in banking or finance.

Some types of pain deserve immediate attention from your dentist, however. If you feel a sharp pain when you bite down, for instance, you may have a cavity, a loose filling, a cracked tooth, or damaged pulp (that's the inner core of the tooth that contains the blood vessels and nerves). Pain that sticks around for more than 30 minutes after eating hot or cold foods can also indicate pulp damage, either from a deep cavity or a blow to the tooth. And the stereotypical toothache with constant and severe pain, swelling, and sensitivity is definitely a sign of trouble.
One more point about digging into your reserve when your chip stack is low. In a regular game, it is never advisable to wait until your stack is depleted before buying more chips. If your stack is too low, you can't play with strength. 
(Also, if a real anesthesiologist reads this and finds anything wrong with it, please let me know!)Anesthetics (this includes propofol, sevoflurane, etc.) can go into 3 major "sinks" in the body: in the blood, in the brain, or in fatty tissues. 
Getting bloodwork done is also a great idea for determining a lack/surplus of this or that.

I really liked Pagan Idol. I was there fairly early, so I don know how crowded it gets, but it a nice big open space and the back room (which opens an hour after the general opening) is very nicely decorated. Their drinks are also good, they have a neat collection of tiki mugs above the bar in the back, and their aquarium has an emperor angelfish, which is one of my favorite fish! They also don have food tho :(. 
I had the luxury of a nice quiet life, and I had given up my dream, for a second chance. All of my friends, had seemingly forgotten about me, just like all the rest, and a part of me was fine with that. They all had lives to live, and with so much life in them, it was only natural that people would gravitate to them. 
To me, the solution is to work with those who I may agree with on other issues to improve education and critical thinking regarding the second amendment. The ballot box is too late to do that   you're already voting on too aggregate a platform to send an effective message about one issue. 
In college I went to the dentist for a checkup. I had recently been diagnosed with mild acid reflux which runs in my family and being in college, I drank about three cups of coffee a day.

My parents were on vacation for the week and left us with my aunt. It was during the winter and not Christmas vacation yet so we still had to go to school, but the deal was as soon as we got home from school we would go tobogganing (Canada!) down the hill behind our house. Well.

Your flat refusal to accommodate (or even discuss) this change after /u/Adarain politely requested that you do so indicates to us that you have little interest in remaining in a positive relationship with us. Respect is a two way street and your unfriendly reply yesterday brought your willingness to cooperate into serious question. Because of this, we decided to move on and establish a new child subreddit for script posts from /r/conlangs, as there simply isn enough active cooperation to sustain this partnership between our two subreddits. 
Dekker ruffles feathers with newly released expos news was dominated this week by the release of Thomas Dekker's expos on his doping experiences in the pro peloton. The book, written by Dutch journalist Thijs Zonneveld, included some lurid accounts of doping, prostitutes and other bad behavior during his time with Rabobank at the start of his career. He also confessed to being 'clasicomano Luigi' and rider 24 in the Operacion Puerto blood doping evidence.
I am hoping this won be the case, but I just can help but get the feeling for all future BGS titles they will start heavily restricting mods before doing away with them in favor of CC. There is also the fact they have their own launcher now and I almost bet anything Starfield and ES6 will be exclusive to the BGS launcher. I do still have some small hope Starfield will be great, and I really want it to be, but I am cautious of it.

What it will do though is give you a foundation and make you realize, ok i need to do x on y board but then you also need to factor your opponent, let say your opponent cbets 100 percent and gto is c/ring a board 40 percent of the time you can probably use that strategy to c/r with a much higher frequency as you be exploiting your opponent that way..

Find it so funny that Half Asian Half White brahs are quick to shun their Asian genetics and boast about their half White side. I noticed that sometimes assumptions are made about who I would date in terms of racial preference and I wonder if anyone else has similar experiences? So in the case of this stereotype, it really depends on the person.. 
I would suggest that you ask whoever is the acting manager at that particular location. I worked in a bar (in ontario) where the owner would play poker with some of the regulars.

In other words, there may be a veneer of populism in the new administration rhetoric, but it is disguising the same old class interests and the consolidation of wealth in the hands of the few that has been going on under the guise of neoliberalism for three decades.If Harvey right and what we seeing is the continuation of the consolidation of wealth and assets rather than the reversal of this trend, then it time for an organized and concentrated effort by the media and grass roots movements to reveal what going on. Paul Krugman of the New York Times has been doing his best to sound the alarm as well.

To win in a No Limit Hold both sound technical abilities and fairly accurate people skills are needed. Your technical abilities should include knowing when to call, to raise, to check, or to fold. Your people skills involve the reading of styles of your opponents. If opponents are timid, you can win and steal a lot of pots by bluffing. But you must also know when to fold if your opponent shows obstinacy. If your opponents are reckless and loose, you can win by patiently waiting for that opportunity to trap them. Then, wipe them out in one hand.

The big Troll was safely ensconced within his new Renault Fiat FunOne when the commlink from his Fixer, The Commander, detonated in the trash can half a kilometer back. He had, of course, accepted the job and was racing back to his apartment to gather his gear for the upcoming meet. The most pressing issue was how the hell to fit a riot shield in a FunOne.((Brute Force Attack Decker with a big old shield)). 
The Clinton email investigation had another good example. The guy in charge of the Wiener laptop tried to get his bosses to talk to Comey a few times in the month after he got the laptop. They wouldn talk to Comey so he wrote an email to his boss (which he made sure was documented and saved by the department) saying he thinks they should talk to Comey.

But past that, people say Trump is the most hated president in history. I sure we have another "most hated president in history". There have been protests against Trump, and there been a lot of celebrity and media animosity focused towards him, but nobody shot him yet. He hasn overseen a civil war yet. No states have seceded under him yet. People made homeless through his actions haven named their hobo camps after him yet. Entire ethnic groups haven been moved into internment camps yet. He hasn started any wars with native tribes yet. He hasn gotten us into any wars we haven already been involved in yet. I not saying Trump is a sweetheart or that he loved, but people way overestimate how much he hated.

The thing that gets me about Ted every time is Wahlberg complete commitment to his role. He never for a single minute wavers in selling Ted as a real person. That would have destroyed the movie, of course, but his absolute clarity really makes the movie. It also says something about the facile nature of CGI at this point where it can be used to make an effortless buddy comedy without showcasing the CGI.

Regardless of which it taxing though, Hearthstone is a game that runs just as well on mobile phones with few changes aside from having no choice in graphical settings.

Instead, he gave a remarkable speech about why we need it.. 
It just a failure of reading comprehension on your part. They aren saying "90% of police encounters with black people result in a shooting." They are saying that, when they hear about the police encountering a black person, they expect it to end in a shooting 90% of the time. This isn a circle jerk for two reasons. First, as I explained, they are explaining their expectation, which requires no support from any data at all. Second, given that they are referring not to all police encounters with black people, but rather the ones they hear about, it isn unreasonable to suggest that a very high percentage of news worthy encounters do in fact end in violence. The vase majority of police encounters do not make the news. When they do they very frequently involve police violence.

So you got a flush, there are chances that your opponent has a full house. As beginners, players tend to over estimate their cards and are all to brave to bet on what they have without thinking of the chances that another player is much more lucky.
Education Therapist is a broad word often used to describe a number of different psychology related professions, including counselors, social workers and clinical psychologists. The specific title you want to achieve will largely determine your educational track. Correctional facilities hire counselors   who often only need to have a bachelor's degree in psychology, social workers, and psychologists   who must obtain a bachelor's degree in psychology as well as a master's degree with a specialization in criminal psychology from an accredited school. Psychologists must also receive state licensure, requirements for which vary by state.

Composite chips are manufactured with a plastic composite which will be mixed with some kind of clay, giving the chip that authentic feel. The composite chips are generally sold with the 4 suits, dice or diamonds around the edges, and these are the sorts of poker chips that you can find while shopping in retail stores or through online poker chip retailers. 
Good luck on the tables !There are tons of regulars that know how to play but there will always be fish. The field is pretty loose so don't try to make any big plays and you should be able to pick up on the baddies. It's unfortunate how the blind structures are so poor.

If both hands are tied, or if the banker wins either the high or low hand and the other is tied, the banker wins the player's bet. 
I do think that you should really consider still giving 10%. Usually in the church, they teach that 10% is a reasonable/appropriate amount to give and you did say that the church has done a lot for you. 
The earlier charge of sexual assault involved a female in her 40s who alleged she was inappropriately touched during a Dec. 29 appointment for a professional massage. The woman reported the incident to police the next day.
So does that mean this was a ploy to make a person commit a crime that wasn going to happen in the first place. Was it to channel the anger he may have felt? Instead of getting him help? Was it the FBI who created this scenario and how it was going to play out? Was it a FBI terrorist plot to harm our citizens; already deteriorating privacy? Is this article propaganda? So they can have complete control over the lives of there fellow country men. Lets see who the FBI wants to make a criminal next.

Massaging these sensors can decrease the heart rate, sometimes enough to cause fainting. In some people, the sensors are so sensitive that merely tightening a necktie or turning the head can make them pass out. 
Live Poker differs from standard Poker games in two ways   the game is operated by a real life dealer and you play against the house, not other players. All the games use a 52 card deck with cards shuffled after each round.

The man in shadow and sleeping figure (boy) in the buggy complement the white mustachioed bowler wearing man to the left; the men looking on in the foreground are interesting, too plus there that laundry in the background. Given that the laundry is out (and wasn just left out during the storm) and that no one seems to be particularly bundled up against cold, I going to guess that there was a break in the weather that pushed the temperature higher than normal, with almost everyone taking advantage of the warm snap, as people do everywhere, all the time. I also like the tiny American flag on the tall pole at left.
Thing is, Catalonia is one of the richest regions, so the amount of money that comes from Catalonia in taxes excedes what Catalonia receives in terms of budget and services. It is just about the concept of tax progressiveness: from each according to his ability, to each according to their needs.

Predicting how a person will respond can be very useful, for instance when designing a strategy for negotiations.We investigate whether it is possible for machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize a person TMs intentions and predict their actions based on their visually expressive behaviour, where in this paper we focus on the face. We have chosen as our setting pairs of humans playing a simplified version of poker, where the players are behaving naturally and spontaneously, albeit mediated through a computer connection.In particular, we ask if we can automatically predict whether a player is going to fold or not. We also try to answer the question of at what time point the signal for predicting if a player will fold is strongest. 
Pretty much no one these days fires up a game of poker to "try and get lucky", so if you will play your first week for 60 hours, you'll already have a hand sample that will show you the same names over and over again.

Setting herself challenges and arranging events to distract herself from her own negative thoughts will also help. For example, a mother could begin by forcing herself to get up and dressed each day. The next challenge would be to go out, with baby, each day, starting with a walk in the park and progressing to mother and baby clubs or swimming lessons. Making lists, mental or actual, of things that help   such as "I am a good mother", "I will smile when I look at my baby no matter how I feel inside", and refering to it during bad spells, is another preventative method.

I've done both. I feel like upswing is good at teaching the basic fundamentals but found it challenging to move further. The older content is a simple strategy of value vs bluffs and folds vs bluffcatchers. In the later videos, they start introducing more GTO play and with merged betting and blocker effects. I found it difficult to advance since the older concepts didn't apply to the newer concepts and felt like I was being taught two separate strategies without the knowledge of how to deviate and what is optimal.
I guess I was being a bit hyperbolic, it's not that my family and doctor think it's all in my head.

This leads to a bag that can be used in a wider variety of conditions, and this was important to us.We did extensive work in our design phases to make sure that our horizontal baffles would not have the problems that other manufacturers had: unintended down migration in the middle of the night, leading to cold spots. The solution was to find the sweet spot for each temperature rating: more densely filled baffle that won allow down migration, but still allows proper loft.

I refused to write a toast, and planned on staying silent during the speeches (mom and sister knew this.) however, a lot of people gave speeches about my brother in law, including his sisters who were my sisters bridesmaids.

She also noted that GM had already written off its $2.4 billion investment in Fiat and said GM has ample legal protections in the master agreement in the event that GM and Fiat are unable to resolve their differences amicably."I think it's too soon to say this has all been bad for General Motors, because we don't know the outcome," Simonetti said. "There's been a lot of benefits derived from the partnership for both parties," she added.But analysts are skeptical, saying the Fiat deal could put a big dent in GM's sheet metal, beyond the $2.4 billion write down."OVER A BARREL""GM is over a barrel. It was a bad decision and all they can do is pay their way out of it," said Graeme Maxton of Autopolis, an auto industry consultant in Britain.Under the terms of their deal, investment banks would determine what, if any, value there might be in heavily indebted Fiat Auto.

My pre race was very normal, just the way it should be. I don't like surprises, and try to keep travel stress to a minimum so I can focus on prepping myself for the race ahead. I booked a flight and flew into Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport, arriving at lunch on the Friday before the race. I picked up the rental car, went and grabbed some sunscreen, and spent the rest of the resting, fueling up, picking up my race package, and prepping my gear. The hamstring was feeling ok, but I hadn't actually tested it in a week, so anything could happen race day!

But it's poker machines that cause most of the problems.

After putting a lot of work into ships I was consistently able to beat them with warrior and therion. but climb the rankings much higher and you start getting to the people that actually bought the damn thing and really pumped some time and effort into it. I level 32 at 750 ranking, and the Vegas I now facing are just ridiculous. Wraith and therion just cannot match the damn things in armor, firepower, or maneuverability. It belongs at maybe 32 or 33 to buy it, and definitely should not be being faced by people in the low 20s.

This is the stuff you have to deal with at these levels. Hate it. Bet bigger pre. The 1 2 game locally is the same way. An open raise to 12 is met with 5 callers on the reg. I would raise to around 18 20 here. Still might get a couple callers but at least have to make it expensive on them. As played you have to have some kind of read on the raiser. Would he do this with just a flush draw? Combo draw. He flat called your raise after a limp, raise, call. So you can forget AA, KK. Sets are for sure in his range, AJ, KJ, T9 suited, two pair. Would he raise here with those or just call? What is your image? You bet less than half pot on the flop with a draw heavy board. Have you been doing that then folding to a raise? I am not sure I like shoving here as anything you have crushed is folding and the calls would be flush draws, sets, and two pair. I also think folding is WAY too nitty. I would settle on a call and reevaluate on the turn.

But Eric Clemons, a Wharton operations and information management professor, argues that Zynga needs Facebook more than the other way around. That puts Zynga in danger, he says. He likens the Zynga Facebook relationship to the airline industry when carriers depended completely on Sabre, a central ticketing system developed in conjunction with American Airlines. On the surface, it appeared that each side needed the other. Ultimately, however, Sabre wielded its dominance by imposing hefty fees on select airlines. 1984, American Airlines was making more money on Delta flights than Delta, notes Clemons, who has written about the topic extensively. discovered that there was nothing codependent about the relationship. looking at partnerships in multiple industries, Clemons concludes that one party typically has the power, and truly codependent relationships in business are few and far between.
"Younger consumers are more experimental with beauty routines in general, and they're much less self conscious about their personal lives, because they spend so much of their lives on social media," said Gaither. "So as brands make their skin care a little more fun than it used to be, and take away that clinical feel, it makes you happy to wear something silly on your face, and turn it into a social event where you invite friends over to do sheet masks and have wine.

Yes and no. The less experienced a female bodied person is sexually, the more likely it is that they will be more on the nervous/tense side when first becoming sexually active. This means the muscles in the vagina contract and tighten up (which is the main cause of painful sex for those that experience it when first becoming sexually active with internal stimulation). But over time, they will start relaxing more and more as they become more comfortable and less nervous about the activity and that allows the muscles to naturally relax. This can make the vagina feel less tight for their sexual partner.

System of governance has a LOT to do with corruption; the quality of democracy in a country generally scales with the level of corruption, because the more you answer to the people, the harder it gets to be corrupt.While on the opposite scale, in a dictatorship, corruption is generally how the ruler gets to stay in place; eg Russia is often even described as an oligarchic countries, because you got a small ring of fuckers around Putin who steal most of the countries wealth.I didn say that either. They have different priorities.

Making it worse is there are constantly on break and off shift dealers sitting games and they will tip dealers $12 in a $25 $30 pot. Money is siphoned off the table like I have never seen. I do not get in hands with dealers because of this, but it still sucks to see other players stacks get worked.
John Sarno coined the term TMS and wrote the controversial book "Healing Back Pain" some many years ago. He suggests an emotional answer to people back pain, which I wholeheartedly agree with. Many people have been helped by his book whereas other methods have failed. However, he was very unfriendly in his book to PT DC LMT LAc and the like. He thought that any sort of hand on therapy or exercise program was total hogwash and barking up the wrong tree. I don really agree with him.

Bond checks, Japanese guy goes all in for $6 million, Black guy goes all in for $5 million, and there $35 million in the pot.LeChiffre raises to $12 million, making it $47 million in the pot.Bond goes all in for $40.5 million, making it $87.5 million in the pot. LeChiffre can either FOLD, and still have $27.5 million left against Bond $87.5 million; or he could CALL and WIN, but the game isn quite over since Bond still has some chips left; OR, LeChiffre could CALL and LOSE, meaning he pretty much is a dead man.The A 6 was just NOT strong enough for LeChiffre   a poker master   to risk his life on, especially since he still have $27.5 million left to go up against Bond $87.5 million. That seems like a huge disadvantage, but if LeChiffre simply wins ONE all in hand against Bond, then it would be roughly even (LeChiffre, $55 million, Bond, $60 million).LeChiffre should have known that once Bond moved all in, his A 6 would have been no good, and he should lived to see another hand (and day).Bottom line: Either LeChiffre should have folded, or they should have written it so that LeChiffre had A 8, giving him the best full house, and a hand beatable only by Bond crazy straight flush. It a plot hole to me because I couldn understand how a supposed poker master could play so poorly. Actually, what they SHOULD have done was given LeChiffre an A 8, which is the absolute 2nd best hand a player could have during that particular hand, and LeChiffre could be 99.9999% sure he that he win, since only a perfect 5 7 spades by Bond would cause him to lose.

1. Diversification Monopoly makes a time honored point about the importance of spreading your investments across several classes of property and not slavishly following the "smart money." The game best investments are the orange properties (not the dark blue ones, Park Place and Boardwalk, about which more in a moment). But the long term value of the oranges isn always clear: Entire games can be played in which they don pay off, or at least not in time to stave off bankruptcy. To assure success, you need to have not only a powerful color group but also two or three railroads to generate income and a few key properties to block the formation of game busting groups against you. This blend reduces risk and improves the odds of winning.2. Management: The game drills home this lesson: You can win if you sit on cash, just as you can hope to rapidly grow real world assets if you settle for the rates of return that the banks offer. You need to take on risk. In the game, that means converting cash to deeds and buildings while retaining just enough of those colorful bills to pay for bad luck (penalties, taxes, small rents).

Brew City checking in. I believe the topic is Wisconsin High School sexual scandals. For my HS in the early oughts, there was a video of a freshman girl getting railed by half the football team that got passed around, and people got arrested AT school after an investigation. I also knew of a teacher that had a habit of sleeping with students, happened every year. One was a friend of mine. It was well known by the students, so I can't imagine other teachers not being aware of it.
A major victory was scored for economic justice and just plain old common sense this week when Congress finally put an end to the biggest rip off of college students ever seen: the Student Loan Industry. We all know by now, Mae and Fannie Mae were not helping students as much as burdening them with high interest student loans, paying financial aid offices to misdirect students to these "products" rather than lower interest federally funded programs, and then shoving money into Republican lawmakers pockets so that no reform would pass..

The big one is people project their angriest feelings at this game a lot. It's a terribly unhealthy form of venting. It's a way for them to feel like the man when maybe life doesn't let them feel that way. 
Traditional people from developings countries may lack money just like we do, but they have so much more capital and wealth in other forms, like family, community, and so on   which makes raising multiple kids possible.

Why do Pakistani Grade 22 officers, federal ministers and generals spend this much time and effort on their sales' pitches to their American counterparts? Simply put, getting the American taxpayer to foot the bill for their projects   whether it is getting new helicopters for the fight in Waziristan, new bridges for Swat, a new hospital in Mianwali, or new schools for kids in Jacobabad   allows the DMG officers, the politicians, and the generals that run Pakistan to hold firm to their fig leaves.

Surprisingly, "Earth is my target", the cover story for the pictured Mystery in Space comic book, has exactly one hit on Google.

One of the other major things that made this more phenomenal was definitely the artstyle used for the manga, it was just so well done and really detailed to the core. While I read I could feel the emotion portrayed in the art as it made the scenes actually come to life in my head as I could see what was happening as I read. The use of the words mixed with the art was just an amazing duo and made the manga better than it wanted to be. 
We went late at night a few times. We explored some of the abandoned houses and the school the few times we went. 
Yeah this could be argued either way I think. Thandie was great and I glad she had as much screen time as she did. However, ERW had top billing and ultimately was the focal point of the show with comparable screen time. Maybe if ERW wasn so awesome then it could be argued that Thandie would deserve a best actress nod? I think the awards bodies play fast and loose enough with the rules that it would have been possible. Maybe Maeve will end up as the focal point next season and get her due. Either way I happy regardless of the awards nods they receive :)

Overwhelmingly, most casino gambling is on modern, digital slot machines. There is no human interaction or social time. There is evidence that slots have been engineered to increase addiction. These devices maximize the adrenaline rush and provide optimal sensory distractions that minimizes the reality of the player's real losses. Digital slots let gamblers play multiple games simultaneously. With one push of the button a player can run ten games all with different payouts (the familiar handle that gave these machines their nickname, "The One Armed Bandit," are long gone, replaced by a large, soft button/trigger.) Each game extracts the same wager and it's easy to see how a player can win while losing: two "wins" doesn't compensate for eight losses. However, the player's perception is one of success.

I not sure I have missed the point. I not saying it was ever misrepresented. You make the assumption that they would market basic fixes for embarrassing bugs, I make the assumption that these are not something worth advertising and instead it should be a given that they were fixed when it like the 5th version of the game or something like that. I don think it is safe to make any conclusions without evidence, lacking any evidence from Bethesda themselves through advertising Jim gathered evidence by buying the game himself which is in effect the only way he can for a flat tire so in effect to go with your analogy he bought the car, found the flat tyre and warned other people that were going to buy the car that all of them have flat tyres, so for his one purchase there is actually a net loss for Bethesda, even if it only one or two people don buy it because of him it is still a net loss of potential earnings.

So, on the while I am exasperated by all the 'how dare you' brigade but I believe it's part of growing up and, in the whole, it has helped mentalities evolve in the right direction, even if it has allowed a voice to the crazies and profiteers.

A few other teachers and I were talking about who we most identify with in the class and they were shocked that I picked the boy because I always doing the right thing and staying in my lane. I just learned to play the game really well.

This was by far the biggest downswing I had ever been on. The sad part is I was probably nearly breakeven (maybe up?) on my own action, I just got absolutely wrecked taking action in other players.

Couldn keep a journal because I knew my nmom would read it.

Thanks for this reply; i feel the same as you and OP, yet there is generally nothing "wrong" with my life and i truly have so much to be grateful for. So, whenever i talk to people about how i feel, they tell me "well i wish my life was "x, y, and z" like yours!

Haven been on an antidepressant in over 3 years, and I afraid to start one back up again because most of them did absolutely nothing for me, and the ones that did, had horrendous side effects. Wellbutrin is what has helped me the most  with little to no side effects  and I asked my doctor twice now to be put back on it, but he isn comfortable doing so because I already on adhd meds and he says it "like a cousin to them" or something. I been on both ADHD meds and Wellbutrin in the past, and had no problems tho! Maybe he thinks it will cause a manic episode tho, since I am bipolar as well.

Doctors still don't fully understand PE, nor can they pinpoint what leads to it or who has it. Some say it can be the result of psychological problems. Others liken ejaculation to sneezing after a sniff of pepper; everyone eventually lets out an achoo! but some people can hold theirs in longer. In fact, some experts believe that many men   and perhaps even most men   who say they suffer from PE have completely normal levels of sexual stamina.

Under promise, over deliver. This idea can apply to several different areas of life, but it's a great managerial mantra.

But those seem to be the most likely to be the best charities in expectation, given the information that GiveWell  one of the best charity evaluators in the world   is aware of.
