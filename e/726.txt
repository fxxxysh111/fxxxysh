Today Accomplishments: Today I submitted my first application for a summer internship. I applied to Popular Science as a video intern, and I think I have a decent chance being a biology major who works as a video journalist as well. My parents actually want me to apply for biology internships, but right now I just been looking into a few journalism ones. Hopefully I don screw myself and end up with nothing because I don apply to enough.
I can assure you, if the parents could have avoided this trip, they would have.

It seems to take a lot of effort for my husband to put anyone else's needs ahead of his own, which is extremely frustrating.

Some suites have live edge dining tables made from a tree that had stood on nearby Bliss Street. Decorative oddities, from small animal skulls to big brass keys, sit under glass domes.

The point is that people that look like Caelynn cannot really be put in the same bucket as obvious WOC like Rachel, Onyeka, Tayshia etc. Society sees them differently and treats them differently as a result. Caelynn does not experience the systematic racism, discrimination and struggle obvious people of colour experience in this country. Caelynn brother does not walk the streets at night in fear of his life due to the rampant racial profiling of black men/people of colour. Its just a fact and does not take away from Caelynn heritage.

I find it far more mindblowing that people actually think healthcare/doctor visits are unaffordable. Any GOOD job has health benefits, any normal doctor visit only costs around $100 200 for a checkup.

Next, we must determine whether Gaetz had the requisite intent. I noticed many commenters on this issue say that there is no direct evidence of intent, and that it is difficult to prove intent. This is not so. Intent is commonly proven through circumstantial evidence. After all, you can read minds or exactly document what a person is thinking at the time they commit a crime. If direct evidence was required to prove intent, no one would ever be convicted of 1st degree murder. Moreover, with regard to witness intimidation, a defendant subjective intent is not relevant. Manchester v. 54, 70 (D. Mass. 2015) [citing Commonwealth v. 2010)]. Therefore, Gaetz deletion of his tweet and recent statements that he did not intend to stop Cohen from testifying are irrelevant. Intent to "influence, delay, or prevent" testimony may be found by proving a "reasonable likelihood" that absent the defendant actions, the witness would have communicated with federal officers. Lobbins v. United States, 900 F.3d 799, 802 (6th Cir. 2018) [citing Fowler v. 668, 672 (2011)]. However, it is not required that the threat actually prevent the witness from testifying. v. Murray 751 F.2d 1528, 1534 (9th Cir. v. Willard, 230 F.3d 1093, 1095 (9th Cir. 1985) (holding that the proper focus is on the defendant endeavor, not whether his actions actually prevented a witness from testifying). Here, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that Gaetz intended to influence or prevent testimony:

Okay well I think we just talking about ninja here. I see your argument, but comparing ninja to xQc is laughable. They are very very different personalities on twitch. Ninjas "toxicity" is far more infrequent and mild. For xQc that is his image and one of the big draws to his stream (a lot of people who likes to watch him rage, not saying the majority but lots). Ninjas biggest draw is his skill in fortnite, I don think there are many people who watch him for his infrequent salt after a death. If they did they would be pretty disappointed I think.

Todd hasn't yet filed a financial report with the state Ethics Commission, so I can't gauge if the petition drive underway is sufficiently financed to get the job done.

You can buy from supermarkets these days   the superstores. Amazon and eBay are great to find good chips. However, most of the chips on eBay and Amazon are made of plastic and have metal inserts.

Still wrestling with the idea, he takes little steps to force himself into giving in to the desire, one of which would be to finally see himself, breaking that one little rule that holding him back.

I hope the biological parents seek some support here as it seems older adults are just telling them what to do. While it is hard to raise a kid as a teenager, it does seem like these young parents are being manipulated. People cannot just take kids because parents seem uninterested and scared.

In fact, most of the notes are sharp right off the bat. It takes time and practice to relearn an embouchure.

The real question on this one is, has this dude donked with TP or better? If this was a drawee board or a low board, you might think that he donked to protect his TP type hand and take value of draws, but this is not a drawee board and its not a low board. If he has TP, the only reason he is betting is for value, and would he really bet here for value off an 8 or worse?! I think he be more likely to check and let you bluff. So, I think we can happily say that he doesn usually have TP.

Don't think just because you cannot smell it, your cat cannot as well. The best way to ensure you are treating every spot is to treat as you find them (thoroughly, thoroughly, thoroughly soak the areas, repeat as needed until you definitely feel the areas are clean), go through your house in the dark with a true ultraviolet light (Wood's Lamp) to find markings you might have missed (these will florescence under the ultraviolet light), and crawl around at your cat's level to smell for yourself. It is amazing what you will smell at a cat's height versus your own.. 
As soon as I got a dog though, suddenly all the weird/creepy things stopped happening. The first few days my dog was with me, he would sit under the attic door and growl up at it, which totally freaked me out. But after a few days, that stopped and it started to click that maybe it wasn't a ghost. So, I tried opening the attic again, and it opened right up. I went up there and found a whole area where the squatter had been living, that was now abandoned. Apparently, they had memorized my schedule enough to never run into me in my apartment, and were locking the attic before I got home every night. I guess my new super amazing (and very protective!) pit bull mix must had scared them off, and they moved out immediately after I rescued him. If it wasn't for getting a dog, I would likely never have known. Crazy stuff.

A hand containing an ace that is suited to another card in the hand is a good example of both scooping and redraw hands. You can win low with the ace, and you can win high with an ace high flush if your three suited cards hit on the board. For these reasons, your starting hand selection should include mostly hands that have the possibility to scoop and that offer redraws. Hands that have an ace are the most common starting hands because an ace can be used for a high hand and a low hand.

What are card games? How they came into existence? What were the key factors that caused card games to cause up a bang in the world of gambling? Well, the answer to all these queries is a cake to cut on. That means, as the name itself suggests, the games which are played with the liberal use of cards are known as card games. Now it depends on the contingency that the game is conventional or be contingent by the rules of the specified game.

A craps turn begins with an initial or "come out" roll, in which the player tries to establish a "point number" that is, when the dice add up to four, five, six, eight, nine or 10.

The family dinner scene after the monastery visit is both funny and painful, and is probably one of the best things I ever read. I keep imagining Dostoyevsky posting on r/raisedbynarcissists.But for the love of God, the female characters are so FLAT, every single one of them. 
Adult, to me, means doing what you able to become self sufficient and to explore your hobbies. If that working part time to share a flat with four roommates and going out partying most nights, cool.

I was talking about is more the societal structure of the countries to begin with and their parties pull in any direction from that. Tripartite bargaining between state, union and business. This is a political norm, both sides of the aisle take it as a given of the german political context.

If you live in the warp and you (or your victims) see your Chain axe as a devouring beast it may actually become one someday. The axe never had a soul of its own, but those feelings can still manafest a daemon that lives within and throughout your weapon and actually feeds on those emotions as you continue to use it.

The Leafs got about what you would expect for a player like Matthias, who moderately underachieved in his lone, partial season with his home town team.

When I was in high school, my family spent a week in Mexico City. When we were outside the Rosa district, a pack of dogs was attacking yelping stray. Before my dad could stop me, I ran in yelling, kicked two dogs in the head, and the pack left the slightly wounded stray alone, which then followed us around all day, waiting outside every cathedral and museum we went into, and followed us all the way back to the hotel. I went outside that night, and the dog was waiting. To my shock, the next morning I convinced my family to let me go out on my own because I secretly wanted to get drunk, to my shock the dog was still still there, happily waiting. I drank vodka from a paper bag and got drunk for the very first time. But, I got deliriously drunk because it was at 7,000 feet, and the vodka bottle had a heavy glass bottom and I didn realize that until it was almost gone.

What confusing about the business relationships? Cannahemp products are one of Medmen top selling CBD lines. It sounds like they setting up to sell products with others. 
Living in a post gender world that is simultaneously patriarchal may seem impossible, an oxymoron written on the body and lives of academic sorts like me. But I think post gender might be the correct response to patriarchy  an absolute refusal to locate ourselves on either side of the gender binary so that humans with any sort of body parts and any gender expression can join together to say that bodies  of whatever gender  deserve protection from state interference in the form of forced pregnancy, hate speech in the form of blaming "women," and violence.

You kidding? 90s GM cars are cheap as hell to maintain. I had a 94 Sierra, Serpentine belt snapped? Oh boy, $15 for a new one and can put it on without tools. Spark plugs bad? $30 for a solid set of new ones, half hour of work and she back on the road. Catalytic converter went out? $50 for one that meets 94 emissions. Gas mileage? Eh, who cares, single digits in town, but the $300 of maintenance in 8 months was nothing. I love the 90s stuff.

That includes some high intensity intervals. Between lower body moves, Lee might hand Kourtney a medicine ball and have her walk on a treadmill inclined to 15 percent or do a minute of jumping jacks holding five pound weights. The back and forth is designed to spike the heart rate without having to log an hour of running. "It's actually much better than cardio because you have the benefit of your heart rate being up," notes Lee, "but you are also building muscle and toning and tightening at the same time."

I find it ironic that you compare what I am doing to someone rationalizing slavery, yet slavery (and many other horrific acts of racism, sexism, etc.) occurred when a group of people were dehumanized by another based on a certain characteristic, which is EXACTLY the same train of logic being used to justify killing fetuses RIGHT NOW. Black people were dehumanized for their skin color, so it is ok for actual humans to enslave them = unborn babies are dehumanized until they are viable/sentient/etc. so it is ok for actual humans to kill them. You have so little self awareness, it astounds me.

Many of our old deep sea monster stories involved tentacles, in many cases it was just whale dicks. Whales often mate in threes so while one male was busy with the female the other male just pops his dick out of the water while swimming around waiting his turn. Some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me "on shore", I thought I would "sail about" a little and see the "watery" part of the world. It is a way I have of "driving off the spleen" and "regulating the circulation". Whenever I find myself "growing grim about the mouth"; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before "coffin" warehouses, and "bringing up the rear" of every "funeral" I meet; and especially whenever my "hypos" get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically "knocking people's hats off" then, I account it high time to "get to sea" as soon as I can. This is my substitute for "pistol and ball". With a philosophical flourish "Cato throws himself upon his sword"; I quietly "take to the ship". There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards "the ocean" with me.

As we consider Fry's enormous aggregates of runs summer by summer, we should not forget that he took part, during all the extent of his career, in only one Test match lasting more than three days, and that he never visited Australia as a cricketer. For one reason and another Fry appeared not more than eighteen times against Australia in forty three Test matches played between 1899, when he began the England innings with W. G. Grace, and 1912, in which wet season he was England's captain against Australia and South Africa in the ill fated triangular tournament. By that time he had severed his illustrious connection with Sussex and was opening the innings for Hampshire. The general notion is that Fry was not successful as an England batsman; and it is true that in Test matches he did not remain on his habitual peaks. None the less, his batting average for Test cricket is much the same as that of Victor Trumper, M. A. Noble, and J. T. Tyldesley. The currency had not been debased yet.
