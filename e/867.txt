I do think a lot of people fail to understand just how much content they consume for free, that isn really free   it being subsidized by ads, product sales, referral links, etc etc. People don create websites like reddit or Facebook and intend for it to be free; they want to make that dolla dolla bill ya Sure, some websites are free and/or rely on donations (like wikipedia), but those are the extremely rare exceptions. Without ads, the internet would look nothing like it does today.

In reaching his decision released on Jan. 18 (2019 BCCA 22), Justice Savage (writing for the Court of Appeal) embarked upon a discussion of the law of joint tenancy and gifting.

In other words, if one owner dies, the surviving owner automatically obtains the full interest in the property.
So what sort of perverse and masochistic part of me ruins it by looking at the NY Times Op Ed pages?

Hi Dean   Coming from a person that has never met you and must make a guesstimate based on one entry on an internet forum, I would say that you don't have particular passion for your job or the process of wholesaling   sure, you can tolerate it, you're good at it, you could be more motivated in taking part in it, but you don't really live and breath for the process   what you love is the checks at the end of the road. Don't quit, just restructure your time. What you really want to be doing is checking out a movie, relaxing or playing video games   that's what de stresses you. It sounds as if you now feel guilty for taking part in these things. You need to make room for the things that you enjoy, and make time for your wholesaling goals as well. Every other day, take wholesaling calls   market, research, etc. The other days, go home after work and play video games, crack a beer and chill. You'll burn yourself out if you try to be all business all the time. Wholesaling is a business for yourself   you get out of it what you put in, to a degree. Put the amount of effort in that you feel is necessary to keep your sanity and put money in your pocket.

Our kids understand it's a big football game. That's a little plus on the side of this game, but I said it last week that we're in a five game playoff, and now we're down to a four game playoff. That's the reality of where we are as a football team. It's the next one up, and it's the biggest one."
But an easier and more effective way is to simply prevent them from being in that situation at all. Pay them to not be there, so that they don have to choose between making rent that month and spreading disease around.

Pay them to take care of their sick kids rather than send them to school, because kids can also spread diseases and are often exposed to a lot more than adults are.

I feel that the RSL Club owes a debt to the community of Corowa because we have given them the poker machine licences to continue to operate the club, which they have not done. If the RSL were fair dinkum, they would give the bowling club building to the Corowa Shire (the community) for bowling activities and community purposes.

Safety Hazards   In a sporting situation it is vital that all coaches, players and staff are aware of the risks and hazards associated with that sport. A number of health and safety aspects need to be considered and applied to every activity before and after participation. The environment the sport is being played in has to be fully checked before a game or training begins. This is vital so that any dangerous objects, slippery or uneven surfaces and any other potential risks can be amended to reduce the risk of injury. The equipment being used must be checked before and after use by players and coaches to make sure it is safe to use for everyone. Also, if football or rugby is the game being played the referee should check equipment such as studs and needs to ensure any jewellery is removed.

I know there must be other factors but it always come back to why wouldn you want to bring yourself into the fold and reap the benefits of a peaceful reconciliation.

These new developments make me feel hopeful and really seem like the best and obvious answer for North Korea especially now. I guess I just don really understand why North Koreans chosen to remain separated for so long. Is it fear of a take over or an over throw of their government or culture? They have guns we have to have guns? I wouldn even know where to began researching or looking for information to be honest so if anyone has some input to push me in the right direction I be really interested

After these kinds of old saws, there are basically only two things you can communicate without betting: stregnth or weakness. Leaning towards the table, staring down an opponent, asking for a chip count, quickly making bets, drumming your fingers, "so what's it gonna be?" style taunts, placing hands and arms on the table, etc etc etc communicate stregnth. Leaning back in the chair, talking about anything other than the current hand, getting up to grab a beer, talking to players other than your opponent, folding your arms, etc etc all communicate weakness. Beginning players will always communicate stregnth when they are weak, and act weak when they are strong. Advanced players will understand the signals their bodies are sending, and its your job as a player to figure out more WHY they are sending you tells than WHAT tells they are sending.

Nowhere is the angst over the future of SNC Lavalin more intense than in its home province of Quebec. In recent days, Quebec Premier Francois Legault has weighed in, warning that the company could be susceptible to a takeover or significant job attrition given its weakened state. Those concerns raise the possibility that one or more of the major players in Quebec could step up and buy the company outright. The most obvious candidate would be the Caisse de d et placement du Qu which manages $309.5 billion on behalf of Quebec pension funds and insurance plans and which is already SNC largest shareholder. Michael Sabia, chief executive of the Caisse, has vowed to a rock for the company and observers take him at his word: Over the past year, the Caisse has boosted its stake from 14 per cent to 20 per cent. History also dictates that it is prepared to step in to shore up Quebec firms. A recent example would be the pension giant financial support of Bombardier Inc., in which it invested $1.5 billion in 2015 amid speculation the transportation giant might fall into foreign hands. But the Caisse isn the only possibility. more likely to see the Fonds de solidarit FTQ start building a position given (Quebec Premier) Francois Legault show of support for the name, says Bastien, the Raymond James analyst. Created by Quebec largest central labour body, the Fonds has a mandate to make investments to create and protect jobs and promote economic growth in Quebec. A Quebec buyout wouldn absolve SNC of its legal problems, but deep pocketed backers would at least help it to weather the storm, and keep it firmly planted in the province.

Birth of a SagaWhen Clemens von Brentano, inspired by a recent journey on the Rhine, wrote his ballad of the Lore Lay in 1801, little did he know that it would become the basis of a popular myth. His Lore Lay was a sorceress of outstanding beauty, and any man who looked into her eyes irreversibly fell in love with her. The bishop summoned her to be judged, but couldn't resist her beauty. She asked him to put an end to her life6, yet the bishop refused to condemn her. Giving her three knights as an escort, he sent her to an abbey to become a nun. On their way the party passed the steep rock and the girl asked the knights to let her climb up for one last view of her lover's castle and the Rhine. Once at the top she spied an approaching ship, and, exclaiming that her lover must be aboard, hurled herself to her death.

Likewise we should be good stewards of our money and seek out good companies albeit a little more expensive, a little less convenient but a whole lot better for our world and our way of living. I guess it really boils down to us as individuals focused on our money and not the well being of the planet or others.

Had an ex who was German so his English was fairly good but not as good as mine (my first language) and he would use the word "annoying" to describe something when he meant "interesting" or "worthy of note." For example, he referred to the way that I speak (high voice) as "annoying." Another time he said that he was "annoyed" to learn that I had taken him to a vegetarian restaurant. As an inveterate people pleaser, I spent the whole week I stayed with him worried that he was displeased with every thing I did or thought about.

Just talking about the micro transactions. In apex to buy anything you have to buy token packs, the pricing is not honest and built to be very predatory. For example a weapon skin is 1100 tokens minimum with the cheapest token pack priced at $10 for 1000 tokens meaning you can't buy the "$10" skin for $10 but rather have to get a minimum of 2 packs, and then you have 900 unusable coins spare probably leading to you spending more.

In other words, heteronormative desire is the cultural script that commercial porn gives us over and over again. And eventually it sinks in: this is what sex looks like, this is how desire works. It like advertising that way: this is what is fashionable and beautiful, this is what is ugly. The more you consume, the straighter you get. And that how porn turned me straight. I watched too much, fantasized myself into it once too often and poof, all desires outside of the heterosexual matrix disappeared.

But honestly, if anyone discovered that they were banging their own AUNT, it would be a big deal that would have to be internalized and discussed to some meaningful degree. It has to play a pivotal role in their relationship, because Jon has been raised to be Stark not a Targaryen. He's not magically going to be OK with this situation simply because he discovers he's half Targaryen.

For starters, the more experience you have playing poker, the better you will be at it. Much the same is true of business. It is a cutthroat game of profit and loss. Without a chip stack, you're out of the game. In business, you'll often hear the expression bandied about   it takes money to make money   that's 100% true. Entrepreneurs routinely make decisions based on incomplete information. The same can be said of poker. You're going up against players that you probably don't know too much about.
