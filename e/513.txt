22, detectives spoke to the 16 year old and his legal guardian, after reading the boy his Miranda rights, according to the affidavit.Collins, in the interview, admitted to picking up a stick, but told investigators he didn't remember what happened after that until he saw Kulpa on the ground and thought, "Oh (expletive)."When asked by a detective how hard he hit Kulpa, on a scale of one to 10, Collins replied, "A six or something; I wanted to knock her out," adding that he did not want to kill her.According to the affidavit, Collins told investigators it was Montgomery's idea to attack Kulpa, and that Montgomery had said, "Let's kill her and take her car." Collins told investigators he chose to use a "blunt object" instead of the axes that were nearby.Collins added that he was "really, really drunk," and that Kulpa "gave me a lot of alcohol and I was stoned as hell." He also said she was hitting on him and was making him uncomfortable, according to the affidavit.But Collins also said, "I shouldn't have done it anyway," and added that, "I did think she was dead," according to the affidavit.Collins told investigators he only struck Kulpa once, although they noted, in the affidavit, that the woman "suffered two very serious injuries to her head."In a short interview at the hospital, Kulpa told investigators she did not remember the assault, only that she had picked up Collins and his friends while they were hitchhiking.While Collins is a juvenile, the Boulder County District Attorney's Office took the rare step of charging him as an adult.Berkenkotter initially prohibited prosecutors from publicly revealing what charges they filed against Collins because the proceedings in the case are temporarily under seal while she considers a defense motion to permanently seal all documents in the case.On Monday, though, District Attorney Stan Garnett released the charges his office filed last week: attempted first degree murder, first degree assault on an at risk person, and two crime of violence sentence enhancers.Collins could face eight to 24 years in prison on the attempted murder charge and 16 to 32 years in prison on the at risk assault charge, Garnett said.The teen remains in custody on $1 million bond and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in February..

Vitamin D has immunomodulating and antimicrobial properties through antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin.

The community would throw an absolute fit, especially if this thread is any indication.We hope to phase out the word for more descriptive, less offensive terms as time goes on, but such a task is an undertaking that requires a light hand in order to make users not feel like they being fingered out as "the bad guy." We know that most people, when they use the word trap, do not feel like they saying an offensive term.We understand that intent is a very important part of language, and someone who does not intend to offend is far less at fault than someone who does, but it also doesn change the fact that they don get to choose whether someone is hurt by their words.

Kratom can be mentally and physically addictive. Someone with an addictive personality and lack of discipline can easily focus there entire life around it like many effective substances. Usually kratom has a ceiling of abuse potential.

Na het passeren van de grote beroemde Domica grot, die we dus niet bezochten, kwamen we aan de Hongaarse grens! Hier lopen de grotten gewoon door; dit is het Nationale Park Aggletek. Wij reden door een bosrijke streek, veel bochten naar een plekje in de buurt van het dorpje Josvafo. Na een korte wandeling door een bos, kwamen we aan het uiteinde van een klein hel blauw groen meertje (gevoed door grotwater) met een schattig watervalletje, paadjes, bruggetjes, en kleine ingedamde beekjes, en een (ex )watermolen. In het dorpje Szinpetri kon je het grootste boek ter wereld gaan bekijken, dat sloegen we maar over, maar de omgeving was weer heel mooi met veel bloemen. Een onverharde weg bracht ons naar een burcht, maar op het einde van die weg bleek dat het nog meer dan een uur wandelen was, dus hebben we hiervoor moeten passen, het begon immers al later te worden. Via nog een klein schattig kapelletje reden we Slowakije weer binnen. Gelukkig was het niet ver meer naar onze overnachtingplaats: Kosice, de tweede grootste stad van Slowakije!

If you want to go AMD, you could probably get cheaper by getting a 780G motherboard and doing a hybrid crossfire with a HD 3450. If all they're playing is online poker, it should be more than enough for them. I believe hybrid crossfire allows you to run up to 4 monitors at once, but I haven't done it personally. Hopefully someone else can shed some light on this. Do they do any other gaming besides poker?^ According to Tom's review of the 780G chipset, "When equipped with a hybrid enabled ATI graphics card, the system can drive up to four monitors, with the add in card providing connectivity for the additional two displays."I've never actually tried it, I'm just going off what I've read. I know you can only use one monitor at a time when using multiple cards in SLI, but Crossfire is supposed to have better results with multiple monitors.
A quick calculation says I have a 16% chance to hit my straight if I go to the turn, and a 32% chance to win if I go to the river.

In the above example if you're opponent is holding pocket AA, and has a made set, you still have a 27% chance to win if you go to the river.

In college, I was working in a group project with an international student from China. I was vaguely aware that she was super rich (the Chinese students were almost always pretty rich, as their parents had paid to move them to the USA, buy them nice cars/apartments, and pay for an already very expensive private college) but it never occurred to me just how different our concepts of money were until she, while flipping through her phone at the end of a meeting, said "Hey animalcule, I was thinking of buying something to celebrate finishing this project.

And yes, your mini theater is technically a man cave, but that doesn't mean horror flicks and gangster shoot em ups have to be the only features on the movie menu. There's no reason you can't have Saturday morning Disney parties or (gulp) the occasional "Steel Magnolias" screening when your wife needs a ladies' night. And you can still have your bar, of course   it just might be a smaller, more subtle one.

He has advocated loosening gun ownership laws so individuals can fight off criminals, giving police a freer hand to use force and restoring "traditional" Brazilian values   though some take issue with his definition of those values in light of his approving allusions to the 1964 1985 dictatorship and his derisive comments about women, blacks and gay people..

Customers get cranky when employees are less than "kind."

Minimal stuff is turned on by default, configuring becomes a case of editing system files, nothing is corporate or obfuscated away, you only turn on what you want. There is no Candy Crush installed by default. The app store doesn ask for a credit card. Systems like iCloud and Airplay don try and entice you further into a corporate rabbit hole.

The very next shoe, I started both hands at 2x125, never dropped below, and lost only a single hand. I finished the shoe about $450 down for the day.

With two gears touching like in this problem, they will all spin with the same perimeter velocity, but with different rotational velocity. So, if they were touching the ground like tires, they would both go the same distance even though one would be completing twice as many full revolutions as the other.

Couple reasons. Firstly, tradition. Many hotels in America used to be privately owned family businesses.

I just hope they wont screw it up either. But im happier to see this is a sequel and not a "remaster".

If they really want to address the biggest problems with the Republican party and Trump, they really need to subpoena Murdoch for the stories that Fox News was suppressing. They need to start making people realize that Fox News is not their friend and enjoys taking them for regular joyrides just to keep their viewer count high.
It simple enough to state that they fucked up and exposed customer data. They don have to provide instructions on how to exploit their problem or even detail where exactly the problem is.

Be able to stop in the distance you see to be clear. A driving school favourite is to have you do a lovely fast road then take you onto a winding restricted width country lane with limited views round bends. It still a national, but you might be doing most of the journey at what might seem like an achingly low speed..

Advantageous and manipulative people. This one particularly grinds my gears, and I find it a terrible and weak character trait.

I bought sub2 deals too and financed the repairs with credit cardsand sold retail. In the early years it was very useful to have a wallet full of credit cards. or as I said instant hard money. , what an amazing story.
Look at BP and the real cost of offshore drilling? Look at Walmart and the real cost of "cheap".. 
The craziest parts of it all   one, the infection was caused by the same bacteria that gives people acne outbreaks. Two, a month before my infection was discovered, I started dating an amazing woman. During my hospital stay was the first time she met my mother (what a way to meet), and during the months of inconvenience that followed she stuck by my side, doing things like helping me flush my PICC line and dealing with the horrid mess that can result from a wound vacuum not sealing properly (I spare the gross details but the mess and odor can be appalling).

Blackjack is among the very few card games where a person who is playing logically can keep himself high above other people playing. But the major problem that other gamblers who don't win have is that they get very greedy even if they win a small amount of money. They forget to play in the right frame of mind, which is to play logically. Thus they don't win consistently.
And that same attitude of "who gives a shit?" probably means these people are using other services as well. 
Read through the whole book before you get in too deep. there are lots of details spread through the whole thing that link places and people and ideas together and helps you flesh out the world. also don't expect it to be linear  ravenloft is a very open world setting, so be prepared for anything and give your players options. you might wanna rig the card reading to give your help out your players a bit  i don't like having any of the items into the castle personally, and some allies are better than others. don't be afraid to omit options or details you don't like, or to include/tweak the ones you do! cater to the preferences of you and your players, make it fun! that's the purpose of the game :)
And I can see the same thing happening to Embiid soon once they cover him more in the playoffs too.

Its not as simple as they said this, or acted this way For example, I know that bad players will sit back in their chair, spread out, or get really chatty, when they are confident. 
Southern Miss to take on Charlotte
You want a wide range of experiences and backgrounds because that has an effect on what happens in government. It not just about seeing yourself represented, it about having experiences similar to your own informing decisions.. 
From my perspective this is not exactly a tale of woe and premoderation remains a useful tool between an outright ban or suspension and no sanction at all. It is a useful cooling off period. 
There was an initial improvement; however, at that stage the pathway hadn't become embedded and the benefit was not sustained after we left the department.. 
Beyond that, there are methods to ensuring a greater degree of success at a poker table that can be accomplished on the Internet that include collusion and other behaviors that would get a person thrown out of (if not arrested in) a genuine casino, but that are entirely undetectable through an on line casino. It's probably not fair to call real money poker sites "a scam" as some do work very hard to ensure a legitimate gambling environment. 
"Why aren you being carried out of Trump rallies for protesting?" I not carried out of Trump rallies for protesting. If I was foolish enough to attend a Trump rally, I likely would be carried out.
It has not come to be. Other names have emerged   Schefter was quick to cite a former Citigroup president who was enmeshed in the scandal   but the report, at least so far, only has helped distract from attention heaped on Kraft.

On Sunday, May 20, the 15th Annual Sandhills Poker Run, sponsored by and benefitting ABATE of Colorado and District One, started at Riverside Park with cloudy to partly cloudy skies keeping the attendance down a bit this year with 140 participants. This annual event took riders and passengers to several popular area stops including the Club Tap Room and Nick's Place at the Queen Lounge in downtown Fort Morgan, north on Highway 52 to Highway 14, then to Hootenanies and Henry's Pub and Club in Sterling, the rest stop in Otis and Dolittle's and the Cornerstone Coffee Shop in Akron. The end point, with a meal prepared by New Freedom Church, was graciously hosted by John and Paula Buchanan as it has in the past several years. Everyone participating in the run received a poker hand, t shirt, and a meal at the end along with door prizes donated by ABATE members and merchants from northeastern Colorado.

(My favorites are Richard Lindzen, Judith curry, and Roy Spencer).So yeah. The sources I look at are by people who do know what they're talking about, and the idea that there is scientific consensus on climate change is such a hilarious idea that it almost isn't even worth debating.I would suggest reading one of their blogs. 
Otherwise, the drivers here are too aggressive and possessive of their roads to share with cyclists. I had drivers slow down and pace me while yelling obscenities at me. I had drivers deliberately dip closer to me as they pass, trying to drive me off the road. 
Mais, il y a quelques semaines, ayant le plaisir de djeuner avec Beena Paradin, je la questionnais sur ses activits.

Someone please correct me if I wrong, but I think I heard that perfect extraction into a pure fat like clarified butter or coconut oil can only extract about 60 70% of the THC. And I sure you could imagine, the fat content of a glass of milk is significantly less than a stick of butter.
EDIT: You can expect any action from these girls. The cool ones will let you touch their tits over the shirt, but only old creepy guys do this. 
Many people confused the subscription Reddit Gold membership with a virtual good or coin.

As for the upgrades, the plant was not built to withstand earthquakes of magnitudes up to 6.5 as per the updated standards back in 1983 and even with the upgrades the plant was already 3 years past its operating life and planned to cease operations in 2022.

It had a theme or tone well established in its gameplay. 
Insurance quotes are something that every one of us would need to deal with at some point in time. With insurance being so much in demand, it is no wonder that there is hectic competition prevalent am.
I suppose one good point to all of this thorough digging and navel gazing by New York publications is that we know damn well how they think. 
In IL fingerprints are not mandatory at the present time but are recommended to expedite and shorten the duration of the FCCL approval process. Martin possibly thought that he was in the clear since the less rigorous FOID vetting didn't uncover his 1995 felony conviction in MS and sought to fast track his FCCL application. Also, he must have lied when filling out the 4473 form required by FFLs to purchase a firearm and starting the three day waiting period before completing the purchase transaction with the gun dealer.. 
This means is, that we cannot ask any questions about validity of syntax or interpret the instructions or any question that is easily answered by trying to compile and run the example.

Tsubume is already kinda perfect, so while she has a lot to teach Ishigami, there isn really anything he can teach her which is why their ship feels lacking.TraderMoes  2 points  submitted 10 days agoI think it better than filler, and Raphtalia is a 02 level waifu, so she has some staying power, but I definitely agree that it isn an amazingly written or memorable show, or really telling us anything particularly impressive. Whether in terms of themes, or plot, or characters, it just fine. It an above average isekai with high production values, a significant step above things like Smartphone or Death March, but nowhere near as memorable as Konosuba or Overlord or NGNL. 
How would you like to have a face that could launch a thousand ships? Every woman would love to have a more pearly white and unblemished face. Since not all ladies are given fairer skin, many would resolve to use skin bleaching to whiten their dark face or use a skin whitening cream to make their face look nicer.. 
But the cards you get is the luck part. 
The next one to enter the house was Bigg Boss ex contestant and Somi's sister Saba. Saba who already understands the dynamics of the game clarified to Romil and Somi that their friendship is not taken well outside the house. She advised Somi to be strong and not to get influenced by anyone.
Basically, I never really felt like I needed anything to horribly but what nice about being here in Peace Corps is that a good number of peace corps volunteers go back to the states and they are usually cool with bringing stuff back for other volunteers.

1 point  submitted 19 hours agoI assume you know her exact date of birth? Is there any chance you know the exact place where she was born, apart from "Germany"?Germany has several versions of the birth certificate, one is the classical birth certificate that would show her adoptive parents as her parents and nothing else and another would be the so called "Auszug aus dem Geburtenregister inklusive aller Randvermerke" (excerpt from the register of births including all remarks in the margins).
