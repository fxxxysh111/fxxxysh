I'm 5 months out, so not terribly long term, but for me it has been the best thing I could have done for myself. My pulse rate is down, I'm not diabetic anymore, my knees have stopped hurting. I'm down 95 lbs and my classification has dropped from super morbidly obese to morbidly obese to obese and only a few BMI points away from overweight. I'm the smallest I have ever been as an adult, I can climb stairs like it's nothing and run around. I can wear heels again. I can be on my feet all day long without discomfort. My blood pressure is outstanding, despite the fact that I take medication that works like an amphetamine and can raise it, which is what makes it safe for me to take it now. My boyfriend can actually pick me up. Everything physical is easier. I hated doing chores like the laundry before because two flights of stairs and all the bending were so hard, but now it's not a problem and they are easy. Even driving is easier because I fit so much more comfortably. I can share a seat on a bus or train without people giving me that "not the fat girl" look. It's been great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has struggled wit their weight and hasn't had consistent success with other methods like me.

Concealment. Concealment has nothing to do with accelerating the healing of your love bruise. But, it can help you avoid the taunts and teases of friends and colleagues. If the bruise is located on your neck, you can try wearing clothes that cover the neck marks. Scarves and turtleneck shirts, for example, are perfect for this. Sometimes, you can also get away with a concealer. Just apply the right amount of concealer on your bruise. Other people have tried sticking band aid over the bruises, and use the "I have an infected pimple" excuse for prying colleagues.

Otherwise you check yourself out of that hand. Your preflop bluff just made it sound like you had pocket 8s. So the guy that was calling you knew you likely had off suit as well.

The best players will beat you without looking at their cards. Over time they'll see how you react in various situations, when you bet, when you don't, how long it takes, if you touch your face, sweat, fidget in relation to what's going on in the table. They'll know how likely the other person will be to win compared to you and they'll know how to gain extra clues through raising bets by various amounts to see your reaction. If they think you're uncertain as to whether you can win, they'll easily scare you away with a monster bluff regardless of what they're holding.

Black people have absolutely nothing to do with that, so stop trying to suggest black people scared off all the poor white folk.

But that's not all. Imagine the other things that could happen when you don't move for, say, 10 weeks at a time: When you don't put weight on your body, your bones demineralize and become weaker, leading to conditions like osteoporosis. There is also the risk of muscle atrophy, which can be problematic for a woman's overall health, but also for her lifestyle when she has a job that involves a lot of moving around, or an active toddler at home or even the need to buy a bag of dog food at the grocery store.

Were the Times reporters, Jesse McKinley and Carol Pogash, suggesting she was not "really" a captive? If so, they should be forced to apologize because even without all the expert psychology into kidnapping victims, commonsense should tell them that someone taken as a child and raped and locked up in a cage and kept as a slave would be incapable of thinking rationally about her options for escape.

Turn IMO is a jam. Maybe psychologically a half pot sized bet looks less scary and is slightly more likely to get called, but mathematically any reasonably sized turn bet leaves villain pot committed, so there really shouldn be any hand that he would call 60% of his stack off with that he shouldn also call his entire stack off with. So leaving some back just gives him a reason to make a nitty fold on a scary river, of which there are quite a few..

The number of people who see "stem cell" and have no fucking clue what's going on needs to stop. These cells were not obtained from fetal tissue.

Many instructors offer group rates and serve wine and cheese for the complete girl's night out experience.

You have to understand that cancer itself is your growth derangement. It's not a metabolic imbalance that can be fixed by adding or subtracting. If cells in your body are multiplying uncontrollably, those cells must be killed or excised, or likely both.

Several reputable providers of live casino solutions have Live Casino Hold'em Poker tables on offer including the industry giants Evolution Gaming, Playtech and Microgaming. These games share the same rules with payouts going up to 100:1 on an Ante bet. Once you place an Ante bet, you will be dealt two cards face up while the dealer gets two cards face down. Three community cards will be placed face up in the middle of the table and they are common for you and the dealer. You can use them to complete your hand and make a Call bet to continue playing or Fold and lose all bets that you have placed. A Call bet is always double the Ante bet. Focus on the gameplay and use the time you have to make a decision and move or your hand could be automatically folded.

If you want "guaranteed" phone numbers, go to a booking club. You will be seated with at least 20 different girls over one night. Etiquette is to exchange phone numbers. While many will give you a fake one, based on the numbers game alone, you should be able to connect with a least one girl who will give you their real number (my personal hit rate is about 20%). Caveat is, you cannot go by yourself or you look like a serial killer. Get a room with 3 other guys and depending on the size of the room, you will all pay a couple hundred each including tip to the waiter. If you want a one night stand, easiest method is to game one of the uglier girls who are visiting from the poorer areas. But at least you get to fuck her without a condom.
My hands were old but they moved quickly to finish the drawing before they had even left. The engine was revving to life just as I touched the pencil to the second piece of paper. This one was harder. Shorter. A little on the skinner side. The ring is what made it harder. After Jessica pointed out the other had no ring, I couldn help but notice it. A family man. It pained me to draw that detail. The quick strokes of my pencil drew the ring in place and I hurried away from the hand to fill in other details trying to purge the idea of it from my mind. He was the one who had offered to maybe delay the treatment for a day. Just a day was all he could do. Jessica pleaded to do away with them altogether but he had told us the same. They were necessary. He apologized but wouldn relent.

The best players regularly turn up in the same finals. That doesn't happen by chance. The following video shows what some believe is the best hand of poker ever played, featuring Phil Ivey   possibly the best player ever.

What if the result of all this consolidation of financial power in the hands of a few is that the rich get richer? There is no guarantee that the economic collapse is going to result in a redistribution of wealth, despite the screams of socialism coming from Fox News commentators.In fact, some experts are suggesting that what is really going on is that class interests are being protected by Secretary Geithner and his gang. In other words, there may be a veneer of populism in the new administration rhetoric, but it is disguising the same old class interests and the consolidation of wealth in the hands of the few that has been going on under the guise of neoliberalism for three decades.If Harvey right and what we seeing is the continuation of the consolidation of wealth and assets rather than the reversal of this trend, then it time for an organized and concentrated effort by the media and grass roots movements to reveal what going on. Paul Krugman of the New York Times has been doing his best to sound the alarm as well.

The announcers who call poker tournaments on ESPN have a decided advantage. They record their voice overs after the tournament has ended, when all the hands have been decided and the victors are known. They can script their jokes and insights, and they know what cards each of the players hold. We in the political journalism business are not so lucky. But we can take a gander at some of the dynamics at play. After the jump is my attempt, which is likely to remain interesting for an hour or two, until events upend everything again.

To add to the other commentor: Your gas stove is (probably) running on natural gas, which is mostly methane which already burns a lot cleaner than propane because you only need 3 O2 molecules (per methane molecule) for complete combustion (one for the carbon to make CO2, and one for making 2 molecules of water) versus 7 for Propane.

The best way to play poker is to adjust according to your opponent. When playing against bad players, it is usually correct to play by betting alot and only playing good hands. When you know these frequencies and if your opponent bluffs more or less than this amount you know what to do but don't always do it unless they won't notice. To learn more details on these techniques you can learn from this site. In most poker games a valid winning combination of cards, consists of 5 cards. For example Texas Hold'Em, Omaha Hi, 7 Card Stud etc. In these kinds of games, the hand with the highest combination wins the pot. EXAMPLE: JJ561 is beaten by QQ789, one holds a pair of Jacks (J), the other one a pair of Queens (Q). There are also "Lo" games, the combinations that wins in these kinds of variants are the lowest hands possible. For instance 23457 is the absolute lowest combination you can make in "Lo" games, in some variants, the Ace (A) is also considdered a low card, which makes the absolute lowest combination possible A2346.
