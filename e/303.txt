So it checked to you on the flop and you bet $55, get one caller. Now you have a good sense of villain range (he has medium overpairs, a few slow played sets, and crying called smaller PPs, and maybe A9s), and when you pick up great equity on the turn you can check it back, folding on the river when you don improve. (Unless you have a really strong read on villain and believe you can move him off his pair with another bullet on the turn).

This is going to be super nerdy and I probably won explain it well, but I think about race outcomes as a probability density function. Visually, imagine the total probability (always 1) is like a big blob spread across all the different possible outcomes, from setting a world record all the way through to a DNF. Injuries, training, strategies, weather, etc. can shift the blob in one direction or another  some outcomes become relatively more likely and others become relatively less likely. But at some point, what actually happens on race day is just a single point on that curve   it sets nothing about the distribution from which it was drawn. You did the training. You prepared. You made a strategy. Yes, there are lessons learned, but you have to understand that sometimes, you just get an outcome that unlikely.

Year after year, clinical research teams and investigating physicians are subjected to an exponential growth in the administrative burden, paperwork, and regulation associated with clinical trials. The fault for this increase in bureaucracy is caused at all levels. The law has not appreciably changed since 2001, but those administering it or working within it are producing increasing bureaucratic demands. The universal explanation for this ever increasing workload is that it represents "good clinical practice" (GCP) and is there to support the safety of the patient and the integrity of the research. It is impossible to disagree with those aims, however this deluge of bureaucracy is in danger of having the opposite effect. We are inundated with multiple amendments, many of which are of no clinical relevance, receive information on side effects that have been known about for many years, or SUSARs (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) that are neither serious or unexpected, as well as countless clinically insignificant queries. All of these have to be acknowledged through online, password protected systems which are different for different trials and can mean having to do this multiple times if you are running multiple studies with the same drug.

As I watched this movie I knew a lot of people were going to feel this way. HOWEVER, I disagree. I'm really happy these movies are becoming more mainstream, Love Simon has helped that culture to make these movies mainstream. I'm sure this movie alone has made so many individuals comfortable in their own skin, maybe next year a movie with a completely different demographic that those in Love Simon could relate to will come out. I know every single individual who perfectly related to Moonlight, for example, probably can't relate to Love, Simon perfectly. I, for one, as a school counselor who sees these issues in students quite often, am THRILLED with this movie. I cried with how happy the film was. No movie could possibly ever reach everyone. I'm happy we are making progress, and this film was a great example of that. Let's not knock it because it's not perfect.

Because infinity is not a real number, infinity times infinity doesn mean anything. If you on the other hand had two numbers a and b and examined their product ab and let both of those approach infinity, the roduct would also approach infinity.

En dan de trappen af naar de metro; dit is een vrij klein station, met bronzen beelden en veel marmer. Het Russische metronetwerk is bekend voor de sjieke stations, nog uit de tijd van Stalin. 5 haltes en dan uitstappen; we belandden op het Theatralnaya Plein, met veel kraampjes dus eerst proberen wat te drinken te kopen.

Morse to counter the Roebling plan to erect the East River (later "Brooklyn") Bridge in about the same location. This is how this bridge plays itself out in my mind: a suspension bridge of some substantial size is constructed to carry a ferry from Manhattan to Brooklyn, even though it seems that a ferry would be able to get from one place to the other with not terrible fuss, except in the old style of using a boat it would be moving on/in the river rather than over it.

I tend to check out most boy idol shows since they are really easy to watch idly to relax and I went into this thinking it would be just another one to add to the pile but I actually started getting interested in the characters and got attached after a few episodes (I think I got too many screenshots with lines that felt relatable, oddly enough, lol). The characters stories seemed simple but got you curious, the banter felt silly but made me grin like an idiot and their little "adventures" weren out of the ordinary for an idol show but they kept me wanting to watch more (that pause for the last few episodes killed me). I feel that if you watch a few episodes and find at least one character you think is interesting, the rest of the show somehow gets more interesting, too.

Our laws are based on the English common law, however, saying we have the same legal system is not accurate. Especially when referring to criminal law. Criminal common law offenses no longer exist at the federal level or in most states. In my State, much common law has been replaced by statutory law even in civil matters.

And really does it make sense? The situation is very similar to the variant with return of losing. If a stake has won   we are already in the black. If it has lost   we'll get a tournament prize of $100. So, the math expectancy of the above mentioned stake amounting to $350 is: $3500,49 ($350 $100)0,51=$44. Yes, we may lose $250 today, but shall win $350 tomorrow, and over a year playing every day, we'll accumulate pretty 365$44=$16 000. Having solved a simple equation, we'll find out that stakes up to $1900 are profitable for us! Of course, for such a casino game we need to have thousands of dollars on our account, but we certainly can't blame casinos for dishonesty or gamblers for being foolish.

Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges.

They'll likely find a catch to deny your "free" plane travel or cruise, including a staggering number of blackout dates. If you do get the trip, rest assured it won't be free.
The kids on my bus were awful. They would target the busdrivers personal life. His wife died and they would make songs about her death and how it was his fault. They would make jokes about the only person who would suck his dick now was his son (who also rode the bus) they got a hold of pictures from his wife memorial and made copies and would liter the bus with them with awful messages I can bare repeating. They would sing about how he needed to die and join his wife in hell. It was so bad I had to stop riding the bus because it made me sick to see.

The laws, too, are a bit of a mixed bag. In high school, you often see that the Romans were an ordered people, having everything just so, and establishing firm constants over the area which they ruled. This, like all generalizations, is a lovely fantasy.

At least Japanese government paid compensation money and issued apologies and whether it sincere or not to the Koreans, it better than Korean government outright denying everything in Vietnam and barely doing anything about it.

FYI, Netflix valuation ($153B) is higher than all of New Zealand publicly traded companies put together ($112B). Fixating on whether Netflix actually paid $0 or $130M in taxes is missing the point. Do you think that all publicly traded NZ companies put together only pay $130M in taxes? Of course not. If they did, NZ would be unable to offer essential services. Netflix tax bill is a joke.

That was a good read, thanks. It is true that private railway (or even bus networks) may not work so well in sub urban or rural towns. Tokyo Osaka) travel is either train (shinkansen) or inter city bus (if close distance) than flights, because time and efforts have to be spent on traveling to and from airports, as well as boarding/checking in/security processes is quite overwhelming. I sure US has more strict rules on security on flights and that wouldn encourage me. I once used Amtrack for traveling from NYC to Montreal. That was both cheap and wonderful experience, and I don know why more people use that system (maybe too slow for a longer distance travel though).

The pain of withdrawal being worse than the pain itself isn't universal by any means. For one thing, withdrawal symptoms go away. But for many, being off the opiates is a great way to be in so much pain it becomes very difficult to find a way to keep living. My husband is frequently unable to leave bed until his meds are working. At my worst, even with the meds I have been on bedrest 4 days a week to function in a minimal fashion for three days a week. In the worst cases, people commit suicide from the extreme pain. I've withdrawn from opiates before and there's no doubt it's miserable, but knowing it ends makes a big difference. This January marked the 6th anniversary of the night my extreme nerve pain started, and that's a long, long time to ask myself if I'll ever walk more than a few yards without help, or if I'll ever be able to run, jump, drive more than a few minutes, lift more than 10 pounds, or dance again.

More likely he acquired his reverse noblesse oblige by training from his father who, according to Trump biographer Harry Hurt III, raised young Donald to become "a killer" and told him "you are king."

Certainly, classical thinking tells us that there are neural connections from the body to the brain through peripheral nerves, and, in particular, the vagus nerve, which provides information from the gut to the brain. Evidence that bacteria in the GI tract can activate the vagus connection to the brain comes from work showing that administering food borne pathogens, such as Citrobacter rodentium and Campylobacter jejuni, to mice activated vagal pathways and related brain regions.20, 21 This neural activation occurred in the absence of a peripheral immune response, suggesting the presence of a direct link between the bacteria in the gut and the nervous system.

It's a science class, very easy to avoid plagiarism but they had one assignment where they had to read some documents and regurgitate some uses of an object. I had a student copy and paste paragraphs about the formation of said object, the uses, and the chemical structure of it, and they changed one word a sentence. As if that made it not plagiarism (and also totally not answering the actual question).. 
I'd go shopping with my dad, and she'd say I'd picked him over her, that I hated her, he turned me against her, how could he, how could I, etc. Over a benign shopping trip. An errand.

Losing her shit, ascribing meaning where there was none, making conspiracies out of thin air, over petty shit that had nothing to do with her. All my life was like this. Everything had meaning.

Credit card companies began to take on a variety of shady practices, from completely incomprehensible late fees, raising rates without warning or cause, and interest rates at about 19% but as high as 28% for "high risk" customers   like college students, the unemployed, and even one of my dogs, who until a year ago regularly received credit cards in the mail (the other dog seemed a bit miffed about her lack of credit, but there was really nothing to be done about it. Like many credit card recipients, she has no job and no marketable job skills and I not going to co sign for her)..

Age is the first factor in determining if something is vintage, and it's also the hardest to pin down. Most will say something qualifies as vintage if it's 20 to 25 years old or older. In fact, the online shop Etsy, which allows users to sell vintage and handmade goods, requires items labeled vintage to be at least 20 years old. On the other hand, old is relative. A pair of shoes you've had in your closet for three years might be old, and shoes you've had for 10 years might be really old, but neither would be considered vintage. This makes a vintage wine especially representative of a particular year. Vintage clothing can similarly be representative, or even emblematic, of a specific year or era in time and fashion. Just as 1960s mod dresses or 1920s flapper dresses are timeless and iconic, savvy shoppers on the hunt for vintage clothing will seek out styles that are recognizable.

With all the crimes that Trump committed, he still has an approval rating over 40%. That is mind boggling. His approval rating is so high, the Senate may not convict Trump because not enough Republicans will vote to convict him, even if the House impeaches him. And with the huge turnout of Republican voters in the 2018 midterms, Trump and the Republicans are a threat in 2020.
I lean towards the left but we shouldn just blindly follow any one ideology because all of them have their own benefits and flaws.

It generally considered nefarious, because the person saying All Lives Matter is only doing it as a response to someone else petition for justice and not actually trying to help anything.So your first comment was fine; it was just a general question asking why there was a particular focus. But your later comments saying that it wasn worth talking about asexual people experiences was where it seemed much more like just trying to squash minority voices.

The walk offers striking sea and cliff views, but as a result is very exposed to the wind. Do not attempt this walk on a windy day as you will be worn down by the wind.

You are still in an early enough phase of your relationship that I would suggest you do a really honest evaluation of the character of your man and ask yourself whether you can happily respect and honor him if he were not to change all that much with this issue. If you start out in a pattern of you being more of a leader, because he has more of a passive approach to life, it could be difficult for this to change. It could also be difficult for you to really and truly respect him. The feeling of true respect for your man is one of the best feelings, and both you and he deserve it.

Color and its use and abuse is a very personal thing especially the "abuse" part. The pamphlet below (Views of the New York World Fair, 1939, and published that year) to me is certainly one of those entries in the history of the abuse of color, not so much that the colors used in it are odd together, but the saturation of color across the board leads to something like Splendorama hyper color. I not sure why the colors are like this they remind me of a color equivalent of a laboriously and not very good translation of a tech manual. It isn as though color printing was new in the publishing industry, as books had been printed in different colors besides black for at least 300 years by this time; even full color printing had been around for 120+ years, so it isn as though they were experimenting with the color equivalent of newly available typefaces in a 1985 word program.

I know he would likely just reraise to what his initial bet would have been but when I read something like "donking is an unorthodox and unusual move" urban dictionary. I think it could have a place in your strategy in certain situations. I certainly don't think one should always check back to the pre flop raiser.

Medicine is based on biological science. It has an internationally consistent terminology, which is used for diagnosis, communication, and treatment of diseases based on individual age, severity of illness, and comorbidities. The ambiguous term elderlyoffers no useful information about any of this. In medicine it can evoke false ideas about the person being described as elderly in the listener's mind, introduce unfair social biases and generalisations, and generate ill conceived policies. Stating a patient's actual age is more appropriate and more informative.

KD administration also reduced brain oedema and cellular apoptosis.These results suggest that the KD might be a useful treatment for children suffering from the consequences of TBI.The Brain That Changes Itself by Dr.
