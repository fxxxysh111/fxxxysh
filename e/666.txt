Honestly, I don think there enough information.

I assuming (because I acted this way before) that he catches winds of motivation, energy, and optimism, and those are the times in which he asks you to help him out and to remind him of his goals.

Hand 3   raise more pre. Standard Live 1/2 UTG facing a caller is usually in the 6 7bb range for an open. $10 is likely going to get you called in multiple spots and force you to play a premium hand out of position in a multi way pot, and bring you a lot of tough spots on future streets (which is exactly what happens in this hand). From your description, it seems like V only had $40 behind the $50 so when he leads here I think I raise to $150 to charge draws and top pairs a bad price that will still get called if players behind you connect. If we were deeper, say 150bb effective to start, a call would be fine as we block a lot of nutted FDs with the Kc.

They want to dig deeper into the ruins under Copperton but the town is on Argosian soil so they forbid it. The Dwarven city state of Iron Gate is confident that if there is some kind of Kraken threat they will be save deep underground in there fortress city.

Remember, tournaments are partly about staying alive, consider what is obvious but often ignored: wagering all your chips on a gamble will at best double your chips if you're lucky but at worst get you busted out of the tournament. Once you understand that the upshot of doubling your chip count is nowhere near worth the risk of busting out, you'll be ahead of most novices, and realize that you should just about only risk all your chips when you KNOW you've already won. The classic extreme of this is the scenario in which even folding pocket aces pre flop makes sense (yes, it can).

When William Slim first took command of the 14th British Army on the Indian frontier, he was given an army that had suffered tremendous hardship. Not only had it suffered the longest retreat ever in British military history during the invasion of Burma, but it had repeatedly been misused in actions that it wasn ready for.

I written an overview of the career of William Slim which follows this narrative.

Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know.

Identical twins share nearly 100 percent of their genes, and fraternal twins share about half of their genes.In both cases the siblings early developmental environment   both in the womb and after birth are very similar.Several small twin studies in the past decade looked at how common it was for twin siblings to share an autism diagnosis, and results of those studies placed genetics as the primary cause of autism.But some scientists believe that those studies weren large enough to note the differences in shared diagnoses rates between identical and fraternaltwins.The new study is the largest, and the most diverse, to look at twins.Of the 192 pairs of twins in the study, 54 were identical and 138 were fraternal. At least one sibling in each pair was autistic, and every child was interviewed by researchers to confirm that diagnosis.If autism was entirely a genetic disease, then scientists would expect that if one identical twin had the disorder, the other twin would too.And they expect that among fraternal twins, if one twin had the disorder, then the other would have a slightly higher risk of developing autism than the general population.Previous studies have indicated that if onenon twin sibling has autism, other siblings have about a 5 percent chance of developing the disorder.But in the study, researchers found that only about 60 to 70 percent of the identical twins had dual autism diagnoses lower than expected   and 20 to 30 percent of the fraternal twins had dual diagnoses much higher than anticipated.Those rates, along with the expected rates scientists would find if autism was entirely genetic or entirely environmentally caused, were plugged into a mathematical equation, and researchers determined that only about 38 percent of autism risk could be tied to genetics.rates for the (fraternal) twin pairs were so high, I retyped all of the results because I thought we mixed them up, said Dr.draws attention to the environment, and to the possibility that shared environmental factors play a bigger role than we had previously assumed.

I'm going to outright disagree with this for the mere fact that homogeneous groups/society are not representative of culture here in most Western Countries. Our culture is diverse and companies/corporations will naturally seek to mimic the culture in which it operates. Homogenous societies are clearly more effective, yes. But we're also talking about at the small group/tribal level, which never really operate in a vacuum, especially when compared to society at large. When the society is diverse a company will want diverse opinions to represent the needs of its consumer base. From a moral standpoint diversity is clearly good. But from a marketing and profit driven perspective it's also good.

I mean busting these places can be done but it relatively complicated and if you don know what you doing, you spend 100 hours on some arrests that go nowhere and don even shut down the massage parlor. you can see why police departments stick to writing speeding tickets.

You definitely have some friends who always show their shuffling skills and take the game away with that. Now, you can keep these shuffling stars beside you and keep the game into your hands with your best friend, the 4 deck automatic card shuffler. These card shufflers are battery operated.

The simulation is wonderful and it looks like a poker pro instrument. A great thing about these shufflers is, you can fit your shufflers in any standard size deck of cards or bridge sized cards.

Why do some people seem so attractive on first sight? What elements go to make up their personality? From what sources do they draw their magnetic charisma? If there is no glow of charm in an individual, it really doesn't matter much, what else they may have. What the heart thinks, is the man. What are those qualities that endear a few in lightening speed to all they come into contact with? Love at first sight is an absolute truth; the discovery in a man woman relationship, of it being contrary, is sometimes a matter of time. But otherwise the dictum holds water.

No full time engineering job should be paying below $40,000/year. The 2019 location adjusted GS 7 step 1 rate is $41,000/year. This is the low end for the rate that the government pays for just out of school or otherwise inexperienced positions requiring a college education. If you take on an engineering position at a contractor you should almost certainly be earning more than this, even fresh out of school. Positions earning less than this are probably "technician" type positions that may not even require a college education. If you are doing actual engineering work with any competency, you are being undervalued if you are earning below $50k. Many contractors in the area would start an engineer in the low 60s.

Dog vaccinations. Most folks take it on faith that vaccinations are good for a dog and protect him against disease. They're right, of course. When puppies are born, they are protected by special antibodies produced in their mother's milk, but as they get older they lose this protection. That's why they need a series of vaccinations, usually starting at six to ten weeks of age, to stimulate their own immunity against disease. The vaccinations are repeated every three or four weeks until the pup is about four months old. Then he gets annual vaccinations to protect him throughout his life. These vaccinations protect your dog against such killers as rabies, parvovirus, and distemper and against other diseases such as viral hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and kennel cough. If you live in an area where Lyme disease is common, especially if your dog spends a lot of time outdoors, the vet can vaccinate for that as well.
Most cultures that have the ability to devote a lot of labour to things other than basic survival do something interesting with the excess manpower. Education and thought are common, as is art, as are great tribute to leaders or gods, as is leisure. The Greeks of that era were quite wealthy for the ancient world, fairly good at concentrating that wealth into the hands of a small group who could use it to support other pursuits, and had a strongly intellectual bent, so they used that wealth to educate and give free time to philosophers and artists and mathematicians..

This response is also known as sympatho adrenal response of the body, as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla (but also all other sympathetic fibers) secrete acetylcholine, which activates the secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from it. Therefore, this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.Science typically looks at the SNS as an automatic regulation system, that is, one that operates without the intervention of conscious thought.

A simple example: REMEMBERING GTO is an unexploitable strategy, so it cannot be beaten. And it is not specific to poker. Let say in this battle of the 2 year olds, Gary plays GTO strategy and Nick plays a GTO strategy. In this game, it is the same as No limit Holdem, only, you can only check or fold post flop, and both players post 1 big blind pre flop, and can only check their option preflop. Gary checks pre flop every time, and checks every time on the flop, turn and river. Nick does the same, only he forgets to check, and thus folds, on the flop, turn or river 5% of the time. That means, 5% of the time, Gary, with his GTO strategy, wins 1BB. That a win rate of 5BB/100 (not bad). Notice if Nick now never forgets to check, then both players break even, as they will always check pre flop, and always check on the flop turn or river. This is Nash equilibrium in effect, as now neither Gary or Nick can change their strategy to benefit themselves. Their stuck at breakeven, like every degen claims they are.

I've been working in the field of autism for almost 7 years now and the adaptive communication skills that some of my students come up with still amaze me. The fact that he's been introduced to PECS and most likely had EI (Early Intervention) as a toddler greatly increases his success communicatively. Did he ever have words or vocalizations? One area that sometimes gets overlooked when a child shows proficiency with a communication book is the possibility that they may, eventually, become vocal. I have a student that has become so reliant on PECS that he doesn't even attempt to vocalize anymore. It's really kind of sad.

Medicine is based on biological science. It has an internationally consistent terminology, which is used for diagnosis, communication, and treatment of diseases based on individual age, severity of illness, and comorbidities. The ambiguous term elderlyoffers no useful information about any of this. In medicine it can evoke false ideas about the person being described as elderly in the listener's mind, introduce unfair social biases and generalisations, and generate ill conceived policies. Stating a patient's actual age is more appropriate and more informative.

Chandrian vs Amyr is a hypothetical on my part, mostly because black and white, nature and civilization, chandrian and amyr, namers and shapers, all sort of lead me to a yin and yang, eternal balance of the cosmos kinda thing.

That's a classic narc move: weaponizing therapy. They're totally dishonest from the get go, and they see therapy as yet another chance to run game on a particularly challenging mark. Some therapists are experienced enough to be able to see through them and Dx them and this can be massively threatening to a narc's sense of invincibility. They rarely admit such a Dx to others. Or, they go in the opposite direction and totally embrace their Dx because it gives them a universal excuse for any sort of crap narc behavior. No therapist would ever sanction this, but all of a sudden, every tired excuse gets assigned to "their diseeeeeaaaaassse". And then there's that old narc favorite whinge: "But the therapist saaaaaiiiid" as a one size fits all solution to all criticisms. Therapy with narcs is almost always a losing proposition. At best, they'll simply refuse to be honest and avoid any real work. But at worst, they will dig right in to the delicious opportunity to weaponize therapy, and learn a whole new lingo, skill set and techniques of furthering abuse, and avoiding consequences.

If the shoe was on the other foot and Fernanda didn't want to talk to Jonathan, then he was making comments like "You can ignore my messages but you won't ignore me when I put it on public blast!" I feel like people would be more outraged. People would be crying it's harassment or emotional manipulation and that's 100% what I think Fernanda is doing. If someone ignores your messages, it's because they aren't interested in talking and trying to force contact isn't kosher. Whatever the situation for the break up, his fault, her fault, he seemingly has decided he's done. She can't respect that because she is a child.

People with more money and higher levels of education tend to get married. Marriage is not randomly distributed throughout the population. If people with more resources are also the ones who get married, then married people will be wealthier than unmarried people.

For example, if I start up a new company and spend $10 million dollars in year 1 but only make $2 million in revenue, I lost $8 million. Now suppose in year 2 I spend $5 million but make $10 million, for a $5 million profit. My company is not yet profitable over its life. I am able to carry over the $8 million loss to the next year, and I pay zero tax. If the year after that I make $10 million in profit I use up the last of my accrued losses and am taxed on $7 million. If I make $10 million again in year 4, I pay $10 million in taxes because I've used up my accrued losses.

Manage the end game: You need to know how much money you have remaining, how much money other teams have remaining, and especially how much money your key rivals have remaining. And for the record "key rival" is not the person with whom you talk trash; rather, he or she is the fantasy owner who needs what you need. If there is one good shortstop left and you and your adversary both need a shortstop, it makes sense to call out that shortstop if and only if you have more money than your adversary. If not, wait to see if your adversary spends his/her money on another need and this gives you the financial advantage
I don like the second option more than the next person, but instead of harassing strangers on the internet to ditch technology and raise their kids with a shovel and paper scrolls, I also come to live with the privacy concerns.. 
Who knew that a player who consistently blew off team photos would cut short his vacation to appear with other former Giants outfielders for the team latest 50th anniversary celebration Saturday night? His loyal fans got to cheer him on one more time. He made a funny speech with a nice deadpan delivery. (Here the link to the video.) And then he spent the first two innings talking to Kruk and Kuip on the TV telecast, where he praised Tim Lincecum and Fred Lewis growth this year and compared John Bowker short swing to his. How many of you expected him to show up? Did you even care? I think it was great that players like Hac Man, Brett Butler, Bill North and Terry Whitfield also showed up. But Von Joshua and Mike Kingery?

As the story goes, famed cyclist Lance Armstrong not only beat cancer, but used it to his advantage. Following his near miraculous survival of testicular cancer, in 1998 Armstrong returned to cycling with a vengeance. He had been a rising cycling star before the diagnosis, but now he seemed unstoppable. Had cancer transformed him into some sort of superman? In a sense, yes. Pre cancer, Armstrong had been weighed down by several extra kilos of upper body mass. It wasn't fat   he was just a muscular guy. Still, the extra weight was a burden, and since it was in the upper body, it didn't help him move the pedals any faster. On hill climbs Armstrong had been vulnerable to falling behind smaller, leaner cyclists. But now, Armstrong's post chemotherapy emaciation was his new upper hand, and it was what helped propel him to seven consecutive Tour de France wins [source: Carmichael].

Three Card Poker This isn't like poker in the traditional sense in that you do play against the house in this game. You receive three cards and hope that your hand beats the three cards held by the dealer. You first place an ante bet and if you like your first three cards (generally if you hold Q, 10 or better), you place a second play bet below the ante and win if you beat the dealer.

However this is an incredibly big plot point, and the main driving force in his character arc and story as a whole, as there's a point where Edmond Dantes realizes that he actually had gone way too far in the name of vengeance and lost his humanity.

An obvious difference is that you can bet people off of draws and marginal hands, or charge them a lot to draw out on you. Proper bet sizing is important. You should often be betting somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 of the pot when you bet as that discourages people from calling down light to see the next card.
