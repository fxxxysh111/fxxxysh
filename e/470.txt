Thaddeus Lee Kilby, 39, of Currawong Street failed to appear before magistrate Michael Allen in Bathurst Local Court. The matter was subsequently dealt with in his absence under Section 196. Police facts tendered to the court told how police executed a search warrant in relation to prohibited drugs at Kilby's Currawong Street home. They asked if he had any prohibited drugs he wanted to declare and he told police he had some cannabis in his bedroom. Police went to the room and found a black bag with two plastic resealable bags inside a chest of drawers. He told police the bags contained cannabis, which he owned and thought weighed about 40 grams. During the search police also located $600 in cash in a drawer and a further $1000 in a pink bag in his bedroom. Police asked him about the cash and Kilby told them he had won it playing Keno and the poker machines on September 7. Police seized the cash and told Kilby enquiries would be made about it. Police investigations revealed Kilby had obtained the money lawfully and it was returned to him in full. November 22 2013   4:00AM

I probably class myself as agnostic (heavily leaning atheist) based on the fact that no one knows what created the universe. I think based on scientific technicality the default position would be agnostic, no one can disprove a god existence, to the fury/delight of the atheists/religious amongst the world, no matter how many thought experiments you throw at it. The hubris of the atheist keeps them stuck in their camp, seeming ignorant of the irony of trowing stones from their belief at another..

In particular, there are three ranges of values of the pot size, P, for which there are three distinct, coexisting equilibrium solutions.

Its particularly good if you have a 400m track or a good piece of open parkland where you can train.If you think of it as 150m every minute, rather than 1500m in 10 minutes, you can work to that pace.

So 150m in 1 minute, then walk back in 2 minutes.

The description I had on imgur isn showing up so here the story. Knight that was on sale. I warned him when he said FedEx was the delivery service because I had dealt with their shitty service back in November and they just do not care. I still haven gotten a response from them on it! Any time you talk to a delivery person or customer service, they act completely apathetic and sometimes hostile. This time they blamed it on not having a big enough distribution center in the area (true, now fix it!) so they don care about dragging ass on residential deliveries because they have to focus on the business deliveries because they so small. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Anyways, he asked them to deliver as promised, and they seem to have taken it out on the box. It has a fluorescent orange sticker marking it FRAGILE on the front, and they maimed it so hard the collector friendly packaging has been bent and ruined. For the record, there is a small business across the street, so it not like we outside of their business delivery area.

We have chosen as our setting pairs of humans playing a simplified version of poker, where the players are behaving naturally and spontaneously, albeit mediated through a computer connection.In particular, we ask if we can automatically predict whether a player is going to fold or not. We also try to answer the question of at what time point the signal for predicting if a player will fold is strongest. 
Fast fwd a few hours, this guy at the poker table called me an idiot after I beat him and I had to control my urge not to smash his face. Such a major contrast!! I guess md'ing that day just lit a fire under of those potent human emotions, like love and anger. 
SOLOMON, Carl Carl Solomon passed away peacefully, with his family by his side, on January 13, 2015, at the age of 87. A mere 7 weeks apart from the love of his life, Carl is now reunited with his wife of 61 years, Marlene. Carl is also reunited in death with his son Marc (1977), first born grandson David (2011), his loving parents Josephine and Lawrence, his brothers Joe, Stan and John, as well as his sister Helen.

Calling out is ok. Feeling shame by being called out is ok. Preventing all negative emotions is not ok. Shame, guilt, embarrassment, anger are all basic human emotions that everyone should, and needs to experience. It helps you grow as a person. To suppress them, as our society wants to do nowadays, is counterproductive, immature, ineffective, and not ok if you want to develop capable, mature, anti fragil adults.

So it made sense when the entire political spectrum in the National Assembly got on its feet to condemn Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri for their Tehmina Daultana was at her shrieking best to Imran Khan know that a few thousand agitators can dictate the Parliament which represents 180 million Pakistanis. She had a point when she asked who would bring about the so called revolution   Chaudhary Shujaat, Sheikh Rasheed, Shah Mahmood Qureshi or Jahangir Tareen. Aftab Sherpao smelled a larger conspiracy in the joint strategy of Imran and Tahirul Qadri. 
From the start of their venture the pair recognized that The Shopping Bags was just a stepping off point and its format easily lent itself to spin offs. So along came Anna and Kristina's Beauty Call and their current incarnation Anna and Kristina's Grocery Bag, which will finish taping a fourth season this September. From the get go the pair were also producers of their TV fare, but recently those roles have expanded well beyond their own shows.

I sure that Freenet or this network would store a snippet of a file multiple times to ensure that even if one person formatted his/her hard drive, there would still be other copies of the snippet.

Apparently, under mounting domestic compulsions and irresistible external pressures as well as his country's barefaced ambitions for regional supremacy and global power, not to mention its unremitting desire for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, and its fear of being left out in the emerging 'connectivity' networks in the region, Modi's latest stroke of genius left everyone clueless on his real motives and intentions. The theatrical gesture looked too unreal to be true.

Once it is to your liking, things happen somewhat fast. Pour in a bag of frozen pea/carrot mixture, stirring until the frost just comes off it, then drizzle a light amount of soy sauce. For 4 servings of rice I use no more than 1/4 cup of soy sauce, just enough to season the rice. 
If you interested in a particular location in Korea, I can perhaps recommend a park or mountain in the area. My personal favorite is Seoraksan, which is on the east coast of Seoul. Jirisan is great too   you find lots of wide open trails and areas without stairs. Naejangsan and Songnisan reminded me a bit more of American parks, with mostly dirt paths going through the forest.
So in October Obama knew he would escalate the war in Afghanistan. October! From there it was just bean counting  10,000 or 40,000 or 100,000 troops?
I honestly can not tell if you are trolling, but if you are, then a hearty congratulations. You are doing a very good job of it. If not, then I am afraid that you are simply ignorant and unbelievably arrogant. Fallout 4 experimented with some new systems and was not what some people expected, but in no way was it a bad game. I agree that it would have been nice to be fully evil, but that is not a deal breaker. RPG stands for role playing game. It was perfectly possible to play a role in Fallout 4. And no, I have never played COD, nor had any desire to do so. That being said, I have nothing against the people who find enjoyment in COD.

But before we single out Boehringer for their fairly transparent effort to manipulate American women for profit, it worth taking a step or two back to the structural level to see what is wrong with the system as well as this particular company and this particular drug. System of commercialized medicine is dangerous because its primary purpose is profit, and the only way to keep profits coming is to increase sales. The only way to increase sales is to increase demand..

Clearly, this crazy story about her not cooking is a lie. But she and the First Dude don seem to be going at it anymore (not that I blame her   the First Dude is kind of a dud) and that is of course the real issue. After all, the reason Palin become so popular so fast is that she ignited a certain set of desires and fantasies about the middle aged woman who could be incredibly successful in her career, a loving parent to a whole clan of kids, AND sexy.

And then the "figuring out" is how that person feels loved (I think it's a lot more based on individual than the love language general ideas)The trick is that women think we know how we want to be loved (and I'm talking generally here, not just in marriage, but in friendships and family, too), when sometimes we don't. I can be upset and imagine a certain outcome where I would feel more loved and wind myself up into self pity, wanting that thing to happen; my husband chooses to do some other thing, (because he can't read my mind, plus he knows how to love me better than I do), usually ending up with the best outcome. My mom is famous for feeling unloved when someone anyone doesn't do what she wants.

On the other hand, if the same patient decided to have salad for lunch with a cold glass of milk, the cold and damp nature of this meal would make the wind cold condition much worse. Any herbal therapy administered at this point would be much less effective, since the therapy first needs to overcome the negative effect of the food before dealing with the acute ailment. For this reason, a patient is always advised about which foods could exacerbate the imbalance and which will help restore balance..

Do you want him to focus on dealing more damage to individual targets (the way he would as a duelist), or would you prefer to make him a rapid fire gunslinger? The sort that would turn the OK Corral into a hail of lead, and a fog of gun smoke?. 
When four hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium, .7 per cent of the mass is transformed into energy. But if four helium nuclei were fused into oxygen, the mass would decrease by only .1 per cent; and the fusion of two two silicon atoms, if it ever could occur, would release less than .02 per center of th emass. Thus there is no prospect of using elements of medium atomic weight for the release of nuclear energy, even in theory.
This idealization of the golden age further distorted our interpretation of later periods because it caused us to understand all change as negative, to see the changing nature of the empire institutions as the "decay" of systems that had previously worked properly but which were now undergoing decline.. 
People are devouring content all the time through their phones whether it on the bus or on the toilet or while they cooking.it used to be that people had time to process their thoughts in the moments waiting at traffic lights or while having a bath but now it seems the first part of the day when people aren taking on new inputs is once they go to bed and close their eyes. Then suddenly the brain tries to fire up and gets to do its job making sense of all the things it experienced during the day.

There are other atomic conjoined terms in this book besides "bomb", and they are somewhat telling of the period. Wells does make a good strike with "atomic bomb", "atomic ammunition", and "atomic power", and then goes on to describe the other bits that could benefit from this atomicity, including "atomic aeroplanes", "atomic hay lorries", "atomic traction engines", "atomic riveters" (riveting at twice the pace of a human), and "atomic smelters". So there are some weak spots here and there in his 57 mentions of "atomic something", and that okay he did some pretty good sightseeing into the future with the bomb.. 
There are many variations of this   for example, the strings can be plucked instead of bowed, or the left hand fingers can 'vibrate' to create a different quality of sound (a vibrato effect). This is why it is so important for you to find a good teacher. It is not possible to explain 'how to play the violin' on a page, it takes demonstration and hands on guidance.

Perhaps most important of all is the tenuous link between growth and the inflation target. Abe and other LDP leaders argue that by fueling expectations of future higher prices, policymakers can change consumer sentiment, inducing people to make purchases now rather than deferring them as they have been doing for years in the expectation of seeing lower prices in the future. The surge in stock prices likewise is adding to discretionary income, boosting purchases of luxury items at big department stores.

In the end, I personally recommend shredded latex (not solid latex and not shredded memory foam). They sleep cool, and you can reshape them based on your sleeping position.

My first person POV protagonist gets one concrete moment of physical description in the whole story: "Everybody says my twin looks like Winona Ryder but even though we technically identical, she the prettier one."

She didn bond at all with any of the other contestants, and she definitely a bit of that awkward in her own headspace kind of person who can come across as inconsiderate of others, not in a malicious way, but in a way that shows lack of self awareness in relation to her relationships with others. I think due to her not bonding with others, the things she did that were minorly irritating became amplified since she wasn really "friends" with anyone so she did not gain that advantage of forgiveness you give someone you consider a friend ya know? But she was definitely bullied, and so even though she wasn friends with anyone, the ones that weren bullying her tended to show pity occasionally..

Why not approval voting then? The problem with proportional system is that we don actually get to hear which candidates the voters are OK with voting for in general election. We give every person exactly one choice, and this system favors less electable more niche candidates. Approval voting would choose the most viable general election candidate, and we won get Hillary 2016 situation anymore, where a candidate with huge anti rating even among Democrats was selected to run by the party..

Repeated attempts to find a match with Shazam on a narrow fixed segment uniformly failed for me, however a member of the aforementioned community was able to eventually get it to match on part of the sample I extracted (and oddly enough this was rather close to the narrow fixed segment I had previously tried testing repeatedly with absolutely no success whatsoever). Unfortunately this new match from said member (Artist: Activa; Album: This World; Year: 2009; Track: "This World (Original Mix)"; Track: 2/26; Publisher/Label: Supreme Music Ltd   see Spotify (did not bother to find links elsewhere for this)) was even further away from the original than the previous match above was. It a decent song/album though, and there certainly is an extended although rather vague similarity there.. 
The Japanese practice of Shiatsu, which literally means "finger pressure," is similar to acupressure. In acupressure and Shiatsu, thumbs are most commonly used to apply pressure, although other fingers, knuckles, palms, elbows and even feet can be used in some of the therapies. The degree of pressure that is applied varies, as does the duration. Anything from moderate to penetrating pressure is employed for several seconds to several minutes, and the treatment can be performed once or repeatedly.

This, plus the amount of OPs refund, tells me he probably gets Earned Income Credit.

Then again, I haven worked for HRBlock for 6+ years, particularly not this year, so the new changes may have gotten rid of those. 
Certainly I wish I had stumbled upon this mindset sooner as I sure I have been "healed," or just out of it quicker. I don think age will have much factor in it, really. I wouldn bare down on yourself for what you haven done at age 28, as I sure you had many experiences and lived very interesting tales that people of any age would be envious of! Your journal seems like a great idea.

There are at least 3 people that replied to this comment all wanting a baby. Here I accidentally got pregnant when birth control failed me last year and I terminated the pregnancy even though I still don feel good about it. Wow I wish i could have just given it to someone who was struggling to conceive. I thought it was kind of a myth that there were all these couples struggling like that. I figured with all the unwanted children in foster care .? But it might be different to have the adoptive parents go to the hospital get the baby strait from birth.

Many people ask how hard it actually is. The simplest analogy is "think of the hardest thing you could ever do   then double it".Being camouflaged isn't sexyWhile the stereotypical film shot sees the hero blend seamlessly into the background, it doesn't show the discomfort of sweating like a cheap beef salad while lying awkwardly in spiky gorse bushes, with twigs, leaves and broken branches scraping and scoring your skin, leaving you feeling like you have been mistreated by a sexually frustrated Laburnum.You become bilingualRoyal Marines talk "Jackspeak"   a Naval lingo where toilets are "heads", and steak and kidney puddings "babies heads".

Why is everybody stunned by political corruption. This has always happened, and it will always continue to happen. Right and left are the same. It called divide and conquer. Stir up the left with lies, then stir up the right with lies. The people argue and don notice the theft that happening. It is human nature to behave this way. If I were somehow elected to office, I would also behave this way. So would all people. The intention may not be there when the first get into politics, but eventually reality sets in and you become one of them.
So perhaps it isn even an oversight. Somebody had to write the Tau Codex, he wrote Strike and Fade to say "as if it were the movement phase", but he didn write it in this one ability. Maybe he meant for it to be a crazy option, since it wouldn be useful to a Tau Commander most of the time anyway..

OP, I'm so sorry your mother has proven herself to be such a petty, vindictive and unloving person. The letter may be the match that set fire and burned the bridge to ever reconciling with her. As cruel has my mother was in terms of letting me know stupid and dissappointing I was to her   she never was as deliberately hurtful as your mother. I wish you all the strength you need in coping with her rejection. Personally, I don't think I would ever be able to forgive her.

I think Sanders plan for free college is a complete crock of shit (particularly the funding), but I do think trade schools, community colleges, and other (credible) programs that offer 2 year degrees and stuff like that should be subsidized much more heavily than they are right now.

I moved to Germany 3 years ago with my husband and I did the whole immersion classes. I would suggest you find a tutor instead of going to group classes. I not saying they are bad but I believe you learn faster by talking often and by having someone correct you right away. The classes I attended (and I did over 5 months of 20h/week of German classes!) had over 20 people in each group. There are so many people that you can speak enough with the teacher (answering questions and so on) or you are grouped with another student and you speak together (make mistakes and are not corrected). I don want to discourage you but the struggle is real! After 3 years my German is still not super good. People understand me but I don always understand people. And I still practice at least 30 minutes per day (vocab, watching German shows, etc). Don be too hard on yourself if it difficult. Feel free to PM me. 7 points  submitted 1 month ago

The first of these propositions is a version of an argument that is heard often on the Left and occasionally on the Right, too: that the West must not its own system of values the ideals of democratic government and personal freedom on other societies. It goes something like this: if people choose to live under totalitarianism, even with a regime that tortures them or denies them the right to life itself, we have no licence to inflict our model of society upon their alien culture. It may be hard for us (with our parochial fondness for freedom and basic human rights) to understand such attitudes but it is not our business to judge and intervene. I have always found this view bizarre, quite apart from the fact that it often arises precisely when there is clear resistance to those tyrannies from sections of their own populations.

It's by far the best game in any casino in that it's actually possible for someone to win, but unless you live there that "someone" isn't you. It's a lie that every poker game features a sucker   in casinos they frequently feature several suckers (who pay the house to be there), one decent player (who often pays the house a commission to be there winning), and the house (which takes a rake and therefore wins at poker without having any cards).

Poker is, ideally, a completely even game where everyone has the same chance of winning or losing. However, particularly at lower stakes, the rake (the amount of money a table takes out of the final pot) can create a negative expected value. However, unlike Blackjack, player skill will raise or lower your ability to win money over a time. Over a long enough time, a good player will almost always be net positive and a bad player will always lose money.

I think Nintendo biggest problem is how they run. Nintendo even admits it themselves, they consider themselves to be a "toymaker" not an electronics company. They understand they a platform holder, but their approach to 1st party games is that of "we making a toy" and not "we making a video game". That approach to games is why they make some of the best games out there. It also the same approach that has created a situation where Ubisoft has made a better Mario RPG than Nintendo has in the past decade, and it also looks like Ubisoft is about to make a better Star Fox game than Nintendo is willing to (they didn even make SF: Zero, they outsourced that to Platinum Games). But in terms of hardware, that what lead to the manufactured scarcity, because Nintendo does think of themselves as a toymaker, not a video game publisher/developer. This is one the main reasons why I think Nintendo will never actually succeed in making an online system that works or making a console that doesn have some design flaw (see: the Switch god awful WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity).

In grade 7 there was this loud annoying bully that generally ignored me, but once shoved me backwards into his friend who was kneeling behind me waiting to trip me.

4x a week benching? Damn dude, that a ton of frequency and volume. I consider myself a bad bencher with bad proportions to excel at it, and have plateau on 285lbs for a year as well before eventually analyzing technique properly and finding out I had a shitty barpath.

Poker has taught me how valuable marginal information can be. Politics/economics/ethics/religion/philosophy/health etc. are all areas where people just want so badly to validate their existence with some sort of polarized surface level opinion about X extremely complex matter with a complete lack of thorough education. They undermine people who dedicated their entire lives studying the subject because of some news article that they read that fed their bias.

A lot of people here acting like they understand marriage and communication. Like all marriage and people are exactly the same and communication is simple. I personally think the story is BS because the wife would have to pay for the handy at the start.

As someone who plays 12 hour sessions and has the metabolism of a teenager training for a marathon, there plenty of downtime to eat in live poker. The key is to be fully engaged any time you have cards in front of you, even if you haven VPIPed or fully intend to fold when the action gets to you.

As soon as I got a dog though, suddenly all the weird/creepy things stopped happening. The first few days my dog was with me, he would sit under the attic door and growl up at it, which totally freaked me out. But after a few days, that stopped and it started to click that maybe it wasn't a ghost. So, I tried opening the attic again, and it opened right up. I went up there and found a whole area where the squatter had been living, that was now abandoned. Apparently, they had memorized my schedule enough to never run into me in my apartment, and were locking the attic before I got home every night. I guess my new super amazing (and very protective!) pit bull mix must had scared them off, and they moved out immediately after I rescued him. If it wasn't for getting a dog, I would likely never have known. Crazy stuff.

I think you made smart decisions. One piece of advice I learned in a self defense class is that being on the phone is actually more dangerous than not because it reduces your situational awareness and doesn't provide you with additional security, just a false sense of it.

Situational awareness, a prepared mindset, "strong" body language and the willingness to make a scene are the best deterrents to being attacked.

However, one notable experience I had in recent memory, I was looking for my wallet. I couldn find it anywhere. I was wearing this big knit alpaca wool sweater with two pockets, and I had checked the pockets several times to no avail, opening the pockets and looking into them, even sticking my fingers through the knit holes at the bottoms of the pockets to be sure (although the pockets were approximately wallet sized so there no way it could have gotten lost in there). I walked around, still wearing the sweater, asking several people if they seen my wallet. Finally sat down with a friend to have a smoke, shrugging about the lost wallet. He asked me for a lighter, I reached into my pocket, and pulled out my FUCKING WALLET. My friend insisted it must have been there the whole time and I just missed it somehow, but there is seriously no way. I stuck my hand in there multiple times not 15 minutes beforehand. There was no one around who would have stolen it and slipped it back in, nor had there been an opportunity for anyone to do so, as I been wearing it the whole time.

What I do is predicated on the notion that you were legitimately successful at 20F. 
The point of all this isn to suggest that online casinos and online poker rooms be allowed to operate with no regard for the law. Many of us that are opposed to the bill aren opposed to regulation. In fact, we welcome it.

When I see someone fighting without her it almost like their game is in slow mo, that being said it almost impossible to fight manually with her on your team. Between her and SNOW MIKU I got crits up on 3 units, 4 of them are ready to activate (swipe or tap) about every 3 to 5 seconds.

Furthermore, special programs may help player to get some information about opponents online, so that less time may be occupied by personal analysis. 
I understand one of the reasons to have this approach in Poker Hands is because it helps make the analysis more broadly applicable, rather than just super specific to the opponents in the actual hand.

Generally you get your biggest compensation bumps through external opportunities (organizations sometimes have internal caps/limits that they don have to abide to with external hires). 
Its not too much of a stretch to me that there would be anti vaxxers hosting communities on there. It does boast communities for everything via YouTuber ads. They get popular youtubers in a fandom to read an ad for it during their videos, it's not unbelievable to me a mom would have heard of or tried it. I mean, I'm older than some anti vax parents and I'm not that old.

I moved my daughter back to (boys) mixed league this year after she tore it up two years in a row with girls. Those two years were good for her though, like you said, learning to be a leader, set a good example, work hard on herself instead of comparing herself to better players. If it weren't for playing girls hockey, she would likely have stayed on defense with the one other girl on the team. Instead, she went forward, centre, and is now currently the centre of the first line on her mixed team and leading for points in the playoffs. Next year though she'll try out for bantam elite girls.

Secondly, the pacifiers are gifted so the future ballerinas, you call your bouncers can all sleep together holding hands and suck on them at night making them go to sleep better at night.

However, Mallik fails to relate to it as a story or script and feels that it is over cooked in some ways. "I am not sure I like the narrative or the screenplay. I don't think it delivers the brand message in a succinct manner.

Internett er noe som fremmer demokrati, og gir makt til folket. Det er vanskelig  forst at visse folkevalgte virkelig vil strupe internett. Det flger av slike holdninger hos disse politikerne at de er lgnaktige, og har skjulte hensikter   de er antidemokratiske, og har ikke noe  gjre i et system som etterstreber demokrati. Hvem faen tror politikere at de er. Folka i PST og visse folk innen politiet og forsvar (og leger) virker  vre som utsulta gribber etter  kunne kontrollere. Hvem faen tror de at de er. "Din informasjon er trygg hos meg." Dagens regjering m vekk, og noe annet m p plass. Hyre nrmer seg  fullbyrde stereotypen at de vil delegge velferdstat og statlig handlekraft til fordel for det private. Plutselig har private aktrer mye mer makt over deg og meg og samfunn. FRP lige s. Farlig tankegods. Pengene skal sluses opp til de hyere sosiale lag. Venstre er ikke noe parti, de juger s det renner. Og KRF er rett og slett skumle med sine middelalderske holdninger, det er bare toppen av isfjellet vi ser. Man vil heller ikke ha slue ler som AP ved makten, eller totalt preglse partier som SV og MDG, som vil delegge for de lavere sosiale lag, kun for  klappe seg selv p skuldra og si at de bryr seg om milj. Disse partiene saboterer samfunnsutvikling og skaper strre sosial ulikhet slik H og FRP gjr, men angriper folket p en annen mte. Det er p tide  f ryddet litt opp. Systemet virker avleggs, og lovverket er s middelaldersk at det  i det hele tatt tenke tanken p  overvke folk mer, er sinnsykdom.

I think we as a society make it very hard to speak out in these matters because we do not give people the vocabulary as a default, only when something bad happens. I was victimized by someone at the day spa I was attending a few months back where a patron followed me into the restroom and exposed themselves to me while masturbating.

BUT you must be aware of some things:you should buy cheap spare glasses and use them, not your expensive ones since they might get lost while swimming or break.the frame and glasses (see below) should be both made of plastic! metal gets freaking hot   up to 90C depending on the sauna   and could cause severe burns. Also remove any piercings and earrings and stuff.be careful when you leave the hot area and take a cold shower! always remove the glasses since the rapid switch from hot to cold WILL break your glasses! just put them somewhere else or ask someone to hold them until you finished showering.

As for money, it possible to pay for your subscription entirely through in game money, and it quite feasable to do. The first bond (you buy bonds with ingame money and trade it in for membership) is the hardest to earn as money making isn as good in the free to play world, but they are quite easy to earn beyond that. You don need to rush into making money right away as the free world has a lot of content, and a fair number of quests to keep you busy for a few months at least.
And there were more than a few times an unwitting partner or spouse "arranged" a "de lux deep tissue with extended additional services". Oddly enough, as far as I ever knew, she never was reported, and was a licensed massage therapist.

Regulators deserve credit too.

He IS an asshole, but do you get to decide that he should miss his flight over it? IF you hadn been so dramatic, you could maybe have had a rational discussion which could have lead to a change in his perspective and an apology, but you had to go from 0 100 immediately and even if he did feel remorse, you made it a power play.

Fibularis longus (peroneal) muscle is right to the outside of the tibialis, and runs up the outside of your leg. Sit with a firm object pressing into the outside of your lower leg, and turn your foot in and out (like "rolling" your ankle) until you get some relief. I've read that this muscle can become weak and stop working independently (partly because the opposing fibularis longus pulling down the arch is a much larger and stronger muscle). Strengthening this muscle is not hard, and can sometime help resolve various foot and shin pain.
