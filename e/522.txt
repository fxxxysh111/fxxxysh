I've flopped an open ended straight. We know for certain that this hand is not currently good, so we'll have to hit one of our outs in order to win (or bluff the guy out). We know there are four 3's, and four 8's that will make us a straight. 
GlitterSome polishes have 'glitter'   tiny fragments suspended in the polish that twinkle in the light. They are nice to look at, but are a real pain to get off, because the glitter bits don't dissolve in acetone. This kind of polish chips more easily too. But don't let that put you off!
I didn't even finish the trailer for this one. This "thriller" starring Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez (no, really) is almost the exact plot from the two "12 Rounds" movies released by WWE studios.

And these eight months were no ordinary times not for our foreign relations that saw the world around us turning upside down. Half of the globe wonders about the aftermath of the US drawdown in Afghanistan; others keep their fingers crossed about the prospects of US Iran d and its implications; still others fret about the possibility of Narendra Modi victory as India Prime Minister, not to forget China realignment in the region and the growing tension between two Muslim countries. And Pakistan happens to be right in the eye of these raging storms. But none of this could stir the good old Sartaj to make an effort to educate parliament on how he wants to play his hand in diplomatic poker. Not that he runs the Foreign Office in an ideal way. In the absence of a full fledged minister, we keep hearing about infighting among the top hierarchy and repeated reversals of top positions, including that of the foreign secretary and ambassadors to India, Germany to mention a few. We have seen one parliamentarian after another clamouring: what the heck is going on at the Foreign Office? Sartaj might have still evaded parliament if he had not been cornered by the virtual law minister Zahid Hamid (who by the way knows as much about his portfolio of Science and Technology as Anusha Rehman knows about Information Technology).
However, one venue in north Orange, Waratah Sports Club, falls in a low risk area.

In most casinos around the world, poker has been playing over the last hundreds of years. Now this has become the most popular casino game, you can ever think of. You will find most people playing this game in most casinos of the leading cities inside the US. Rest of the countries around the world has also started following the same trend now. They have also been able to follow the major casino cities of USA like Las Vegas or Nevada. In all the major cities around the world, you will find casinos filled with many people.

"The big operators have been attempting to grow their gaming revenue in recent years by moving more machines to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities." The campaign, launched in Melbourne last week, urges the government to give the gambling regulator binding guidance so it makes decisions in the public interest.

It all started last autumn when Katie Waldegrave, a social entrepreneur, and I set up Now Teach. We were sure there were lots of fiftysomethings who wanted to teach, but no one was seeking them out. Of the 35,000 who started teacher training in the UK last year, almost none of them a mere 100 were over 55. Given that teachers, on average, last barely five years in the profession, and given that many driven 50 year olds will work into their seventies, this makes no sense at all. What is madder still is that the subjects where the teacher shortage is worst maths, science and languages are things many of these people are good at.
The most common complication of Crohn's disease, obstruction may arise from swelling and the formation of scar tissue. The result is thickening of the bowel wall and a narrowed intestinal passage. These narrowed areas are called strictures. Strictures may be mild or severe, depending on how much they obstruct the passage of the bowel's contents. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction include crampy abdominal pain, frequently associated with vomiting, and bloating. Medications may relieve the obstruction by reducing the local area of inflammation. If the obstruction is severe and does not respond to medical treatment, surgery may be required. Surgery also may be indicated if the blockage recurs frequently.

I think they tend to target more fandom stuff than kid stuff, I heard it a lot probably about a year ago at a guess, at the time I was listening to a lot of narrated stories (Creepypasta, SCPs etc, stuff that would have a teen and 20 somethings following) and they went hard for a while getting all those narrators to give them shout outs. I ended up trying it out because a friend reccomended it. It didn't seem like somewhere that was heavily moderated, the communities seemed to just be their own thing and I can see that being attractive to some. It'll probably mush your brain as much as peppa lol it's much better to just find servers on Discord for fandom or community chats imo.
All your points are valid, BUT. You state that you have to be better then your enemy to take them out, that is true, but only in a sense. My view is that if you are agressing you need less skill to take them out then if you are defensive and they are the ones coming for you (which is what tends to happen with less aggro players/newer players).

My guess is that there would be a representative of the International Workers Aid society national office going from factory to factory, or door to door, soliciting for money for the Passaic workers relief. The strike was no doubt a very nasty business, with a victory only a victory once there was more food on the table, less illness, and far fewer babies dying from preventable causes. Probably this looked like a victory to others so far as the future of fair labor/pay was concerned, but not so much for the strikers who brought this about.

To each his own, but at "only" 65 mpw you would likely feel much better doing some variety. Gives your body more time to recover between runs. Most plans I have seen rarely have doubles until you are in the 65 80 mpw range AT LEAST. In those plans, you have doubles maybe once in that week?

Years ago, when I and some friends decided to organize a monthly poker game, I bought a couple of short books on gambling and card playing. One book was particularly honest. It presented the odds of winning for virtually every game of chance. Naturally, the player never had an even playing field. The odds ALWAYS favored the house, often into double digit advantages. He shared his knowledge at least in part to help those committed to gambling to try and do it rationally. He flatly stated that casino games were losing propositions and the only reasonable chance of making money was in card games against other players. While the house always took a percentage, the card player was gambling against others not going against the house.

People knew who askren was, but when he was crushing in bellator, the ufc was having a viewership dip. Silva had lost and gap retired. They started cutting staples of the ufc like Jon Fitch and Jake Shields off of one loss because of their style in order to try to make the product more enticing because the ufc isn't actually great at promoting. This is also around the time when they were pushing for the fox deal. They weren't going to sign someone when they were cutting people for the same style.

It widely rumored that I hate the dog, and it kind of fun to perpetuate the myth. The truth is, I have nothing against Moose. The only difficulty I have is when people start believing he an actor. Acting to me is a craft, not a reflex. It takes years to master, and though it does have its rewards, the reward I seek is not a hot dog. Moose does tricks; I memorize lines, say words, even walk around and stuff. But I don need a trainer standing off camera, gesticulating wildly and waving around a piece of meat, to know where I supposed to look. Maybe instead of just slowly panning the camera to the window, cut to some gameplay or something that gives the viewer an idea of what playing the game will involve. And for a transition, instead of just a boring cut straight to black, maybe you could have a lightning strike knock the power out, giving you a good chance to cut?
Yeah, I think the "ephemeral" quality of Sazae san where every episode is one that you watch and then is lost forever is (though not necessarily part of it initial success) a bit part of why Sazae san continues to hold such prominence in the rankings. I never seen any sort of academic study on such a thing, but I think people respond positively to the concept of nostalgia that can be easily "reclaimed" so to speak, versus all the nostalgia where you just buy the remastered DVD edition of the first couple seasons and never watch them. 12 points  submitted 7 days ago.

It just an old argument. 5 years ago this was true, and everyone was talking about how nuclear paranoia was impeding progress and stuff. It is true that this is only true right now because of subsidies, but it is getting cheaper much faster than nuclear and even without subsidies it will be cheaper than nuclear within the next few years.

But when it comes to trips, I one bourgeois motherfucker when it comes to hotels and restaurants. If it Europe, we try to find the most charming small boutique hotels we can, and in a US city, we stay in rich asshole elegant older hotels like the Waldorf or Algonquin in New York or the Ritz or Roosevelt in New Orleans, and the Drake in Chicago is pretty decent. We like to wander around and go to museums and eat street food and all that, but I don leave my house to fuck in a worse bed than I have at home.

I get where you coming from and I question some of these types of videos, but even if it for karma whoring, it the kids like the boy in this video that end up winning the most. When I was in school, this never would have happened. Kids with disabilities were mostly treated like they had the plague. The times have significantly changed and I attribute a lot of it to videos just like this. Kids are watching other kids get praise for being nice and they want the same attention.

Hand 5: I honestly thought about checking this back on the river; on the turn I was hoping he had A5 or A4 so I didn't think the river was too great for us. But I try to keep myself from thinking shit like "well this is the worst full house I can have so I have to check", especially considering the stack size. I shove, he tanks for a solid two minutes so I'm positive I'm good and he finally sighs, throws his stack in, says "AQ is good" and shows me A5

Gliders. This is the modern adaptation of the traditional rocking chair that we know. Whereas traditional rocking chairs create rocking motion in an arc, gliders create gliding motion by using a forward backward motion. In a way, some people might feel more comfortable sitting on a glider than a rocking chair. Gliders are becoming increasingly popular now among the younger generation for the simple fact that they don't look like your grandparents' rocking chair.

A couple of weeks I happened to catch General Musharraf speaking to the "public" from the Presidency in Islamabad when he was speaking about benevolent dictatorships and how good they can be for a country   he was doing so with a complete poker face and I couldn't believe that his handlers had not given him a script or talking points before this question/answer session. Dictatorships   benevolent or not are a thing of the past and shouldn't really be discussed in polite company especially by dictators themselves. Once I got past the lecture on benevolent dictatorships I had to switch over to the Tom Jerry marathon which is far more entertaining.

SSD: It more expensive, but it also a nicer, better performing, more reliable drive with a longer warranty. In small builds using M.2 drives is just such a lovely thing, as it saves you running two extra cables. Within your budget I probably even go for the 1 TB model at just 110. It a better price pr. gig and it nice to have a full terabyte of storage, especially for modern games.

The Wanderers "Wobbly" struck big time on the fourth as balls going through rather than bad skittling was the cause of us reaching a low total 51 to lose 7 pins.

Which certainly could explain why Hizzoner's been so testy lately; US Attorney Preet Bharara just dropped the hammer on the Cuomo administration, and maybe the mayor figures he's next. And for sure it could account for his exasperation with The Post   which regularly hauls out the big type to report on his endless adventures with Bharara, state investigators and the Manhattan district attorney. Plus bums in the streets, chaos in the schools and rip offs of New York's sorely pressed taxpayers.. 
Oh my gosh. I mean, there are so many. I think sex trafficking is a pervasive issue in this country. And I don't know that folks understand it, because we probably think of some poor girls from other countries being shoved into a bus or a van, or you think about girls being snatched off the street and forced into sex slavery. But sex trafficking happens every day in front of our faces. We're talking about kids who go to school every day and then are forced into selling their bodies at night. The problem is right in front of us and we're not seeing it.

Texas Hold'em is by far the most popular variant of poker in the world. One of the possible reasons for this is that in comparison to other games such as 7 card stud and Omaha High, the game is easy to learn. Texas Hold'em places a lot of emphasis on the 's starting hand, which determines who the winner of the game is. When playing Texas Hold'em each  is required to take turns as the dealer.

11 11 12 is a gloomy day for mankind, because it is a turning point to a next phase in human history. The gloominess does not only results in physical death, but also a spiritual death. Look at the spiritual death scale today; it is growing at a very high pace. People translate evil as goodness and darkness as a light. Jesus is beginning to overthrow the tables of money changers again. At this phase of human history, we will witness the fulfillment of woes mentioned in Isaiah chapter 5. Surely, my heart desires a peace on earth in GOD's will with perfection and purity among all people. Unfortunately, GOD knows the evil of man's heart will not repent and turn away from sins of their hands. We can witness that the lust and greed of the things of the world had never been woven as deep in human history as we see today. All are sold out to the idols of the greed of gold, wealth and worldly ambitions. People are worshipping their idols at the high places as never before. The judgments mentioned in Isaiah 5 are ready to come to pass. 11 11 12 is a beginning of a phase for an upheaval of nature, as well as a revival of the Church of Christ. Please read the tab ?Most Recent Prophecies?. It will help you understand the significance of this prophecy. Pharisees denied JESUS because HE did not come according to their expectation. GOD fulfills HIS prophecies not according to what we evaluate, but according to HIS ways. HIS ways are not our ways and HIS thoughts are not our thoughts. This prophecy came to pass.

Doug was an active owner of Standardbred horses, and an avid, but not so great, poker player. Some great poker stories were created whenever Doug hit the tables.

Meditation is really like Tai Chi in that to do it well, you have to know what you are doing.

You can spend days saving up to build a new defence structure and then wait a full week for it to be built, or you can pay several dollars to have the whole process done instantly. To date, I've spent around $50 on it   which is a ridiculous amount for a games journalist to spend on such a low rent game. But the top players have spent tens of thousands of dollars on it. It's one of the top grossing things on Apple's App Store ever, it's fiercely addictive and people spend a lot of money.
Words seem to distract me more than noises; for words demand attention, but noises merely fill the ears and beat upon them.

I wouldn say B+ is an outright poor CinemaScore for anything short of inspirational or family fare, moreso mixed as you mentioned. Regardless of that quibble, though, I feel like Inception held so well despite its CinemaScore because it got people talking about its twists and turns and ambiguity of meaning. That buzz produced a want to see effect despite apparent mixed word of mouth in its time, something that also occurred on a smaller scale with for example   even though that movie had a pathetic C CinemaScore..

Judging from your comments in this thread, you have a bad attitude about dating, you seem to have an inflated self worth ("I have so much more going for me in my life than most guys",) and you complain that the only women you can get to hook up with you are "so so." You probably just a normal person who thinks he more attractive and charismatic than he is; you are only pursuing women out of your league and then thinking "IT THEIR FAULT THEY NOT INTO ME!" In my opinion, you don need a dating coach, you need to turn the mirror on yourself. If you haven had success while actively pursuing a relationship in ten years, that indicates that the problem in this equation is most likely not women but, rather, you.

This article will help you understand resource guarding. I suspect some of the things you have been doing to deal with the issue may have been making it worse. This article will get you going in the right direction. It easy to get wrong, since some of the advice you read on line is actually more likely to create a resource guarder than prevent one. The article I linked to is by Patricia McConnell and the recommendations are solid and effective.

The first thing that you want to consider is if you will be using the chips in games for leisure, high stake games at casino, or simply to collect. If you know how you will use the chips, it will be easy to determine what type of chips may be right for your needs. If you play at home, for example, durability and artistically appealing chips may not be as important to you then if you were to play in a high stakes casino.

Money management in most people's minds means quitting simply because of how you are doing that day, or continuing to play simply because of how you are doing that day. In other words, you are in a game and you have lost x number of bets so you quit, only to come back tomorrow. Well, that is a silly concept because it is all one game. If you are a serious poker player, you are playing by the week, by the month, not by the day. And if you for instance are in a very good poker game, you don't quit simply because of how you are doing. You quit because the game has gotten worse, you quit because you are tired. These are all proper reasons but not because I am going badly(sic), I'm getting bad cards that day, because I've lost a certain amount, or because I've won a certain amount. This is simply incorrect. This is not my opinion, this is simply incorrect. If you will play in a game where you have the advantage, the more you play, the more you will eventually win. If you play in a game where you have the disadvantage, the more you play the more you will eventually lose.

In your data analysis, I see you describe two statistical pitfalls.

You use this in conjunction with pot odds, particularly when bluff catching, to try and make the best decision. The point I think you are making is that some people just dont bluff, and that true.

The 1940s present an austere, censored version that is respectable on the surface but nevertheless contains subversive dream sequences showing that American society is not quite as black and white as it first appears, with Hyde's subconscious whipping of Bea and Ivy foretelling the McCarthy witch hunt. It is notable that the women are named after nature, Bee and Ivy, at the time mankind's greatest atrocity against nature, the atomic bomb, was created.

Many years ago when I was in South Korea, having English written on clothing was a big status symbol. It was also incredibly popular to have matching outfits for couples (think him and her outfits.) Walking around Seoul I can tell you the amount of profanity I seen written on clothing in English. One couple who had matching shirts on I saw had every racist and homophobic epithet you can think of scrawled all over their shirts. (N word, F Word, slang for asians, etc.   it was bad.) Even weirder was their weird cutesy matchy thing with such an offensive shirt. This was pre cellphone cameras, but it still seared into my mind. A lot of Korea was a mindfuck for a westerner, and I wonder what it like 11 12 years later, as at the time, they were very much still in their growing pains and coming of age in the global economy. But even then, a lot of people, especially in Seoul knew enough English to know those were bad words.

Our country will suffer for decades from this strike IF we manage to take these fuckers out of our government. They have their claws deep, and are suffocating voting rights, tax law, consumer protections, laws that require special education IEPs for kids, they are truly the biggest threat that the US has ever suffered.

I had just one more blight left on the blight card, and one more card on the explore card to flip.

Contrary to popular belief, our dislike of women and minorities in our video games is generated by our love for history, we do not hate them "just because" as some of you might believe. You would feel different about us, had you know what our reactions are the second a woman appeared in the Battlefield trailer.

Once you show them you know the rules they will re evaluate their tactics.

But poker sites usually don't tell that a newbie has very low chances to survive against players with more experience. A new player will have to make a lot of deposits before he starts understanding rules and game strategy. The cost of knowledge is high.

This speaks to an inability to assess the failure modes and effects, a lack of understanding of the ability to mitigate or control the severity of a failure, and a general resignation to just letting things "play out" because "you can predict everything" and "it hasn been a problem yet" (ie, general managerial lack of understanding and misprioritization).

It's time for Harry Reid to go all in or pick up his poker chips and go home because Mitt Romney just called his bluff.

Walmart has identified 27 million such folks and, in one recent four week period, directed $2.1 million in TV spending at them, generating, 605 says, an estimated $31.2 million in incremental revenue.

My single biggest hesitation around basic income is that the increased financial stability for the masses may encourage more people to reproduce. At this point, with climate change and ecological damage where it is, you should only have kids if you desperately want them, and only one or two at that. We should be actively discouraging people from reproducing until our numbers are sustainable in the long term.[M]  0 points  submitted 2 months ago
Yes, I salty about how Blizzard is handling things, and the "fuck you, we have your money, deal with it" attitude that their support reps have when asking for a refund doesn help the situation. Blizzard needs to be held to a higher standard than they are.

So we know that regardless of whatever the current "trend" strategy is on how to get more value out of your flopped 2 pair on a flush draw board, we always know that we want to bet at least 3/4 the pot if not more to give worse odds for opponent to chase when facing a single opponent likely to call and we also know that if we chasing our draws with incorrect odds we risk losing more than we win over a large sample. The odds don change but the strategy can based on the situation..

Ultimately, I agree with your goals: we need to abandon for profit healthcare, move away from private insurers to a single payer system, and address lobbyists and money in politics. However, I do not agree with your assessment that both sides are equally responsible and equally incapable of effecting the change we both support. Premiums rise for a variety of reasons, but the ACA was designed to curb premium costs through Medicaid expansion (to allow the government to cover the highest risk patients based on poverty, not age and disability), subsidies (both to patients and to insurers), and by offering a competing market option through the federal healthcare marketplace. The funding for the subsidies and Medicaid expansion would mostly come from additional taxes on the wealthy and a variety of surcharges and excise taxes on a variety of goods and services.
This geographical aspect raises another possibility for the seeming lack of Celtic influence on English vocabulary; it may be possible that Old English speakers first came into contact with people who spoke a very Latinized "Lowland" dialect of Celtic that was distinct from what been described as "Highland" British Celtic, the parent language of modern Welsh, Breton Cornish, if Celtic languages were even present in the south east of England at all.

It sounds like the casino backers outsmarted themselves. They should have challenged Martin's refusal of their original ballot title as insufficient, a title that had been approved initially by the attorney general. He later changed his mind. Their effort to comply with questions was their undoing, at least in today's opinion. This puts an end to multiple efforts to put gambling expansion on the ballot this year. (Actually, the Todd casino measure will appear on ballots, but votes won't be counted.) The casino backers have five days to seek a rehearing, rarely granted particularly in the case of opinions joined by all justices.
My understanding (from my well informed wife) is that food/eating/vomiting problems often pass by the 14th or 15th week. But if they don pass soon, you guys should definitely make sure your doctor is aware in case she isn able to put on the necessary (twin) weight in the weeks to come..
