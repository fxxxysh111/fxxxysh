CB ended up with a nice Carhartt beanie but keeps letting everyone know "jokingly" that she really wanted that Starbucks gift card because Adam doesn't even drink coffee. With ten people doing a white elephant it had been almost 45 minutes when the food finally comes. We wrap up white elephant and start to eat. People are talking about the gifts they got and are thanking people, except CB who is talking to her boyfriend. Eventually it gets a little quiet and CB says she wants to do the gift exchange again because it got interrupted by food, and that she thinks people got rushed and it wasn't fair. Jane, along with some other people who have kids point out it's getting pretty late so maybe it's okay with how things turned out. CB isn't having this and ignores Jane and ask again.
That's brilliant offer for all newbies. WPT Poker Club gives you great chance to learn the game of poker without extra money spending. 
It doesn't throw shadows on Central Park or imperil Hudson River fish. It didn't uproot longtime residents or businesses because all of its 18 million square feet of office, retail, recreational and residential space stands above the train yard. The epic feat required building from bedrock below and thrusting the structures through a steel and concrete platform.

And Phil's hard work prevailed, and he beat Ram and Mark easily. This, as you can imagine, did not go down well with the 2 English lads, but after some years it all got settled amicably. 
I didn get a chance to come by the rio booth this wsop as the cash games at the rio were redic (thanks for not sitting in those 25/50/100 games ;)) but I am going to try to next wsop so that I can thank you personally for everything.

An officer might hold it in a downward position, he said."Right, but they still have their hand on an unholstered pistol, correct?" Morzel saidShe also asked about what policy governs the number of officers that respond. 
In other cases, the physician had been disciplined by a medical board in another state or found guilty of a felony.What does all that mean to you, the patient?Can you get details on why a doctor was sanctioned by the board? Can you complain about a doctor? When should you do that? And how?Here are answers to questions about the medical board, what it can and can't do, and how it can help you.When should you file a complaint against a doctor with the State Medical Board of Ohio? When you have serious concerns about the care provided by the doctor or reason to believe the doctor is violating state law regulating medical practice. Examples of those violations include: practicing under the influence of alcohol or drugs, engaging in sexual misconduct such as inappropriate touching, and prescribing medication when there is no need for it.

You do not need a degree in psychology to decipher what point Bale was making with his prickly body language. His display of dissatisfaction at a lack of playing time under Santiago Solari was delivered with about as much subtlety as a peacock trying to stay incognito among a flock of pigeons.
I actually enjoy Noir Extreme. Mind you I don own a bottle, but when I tested it at Tom Fords, I enjoyed the creamy sweet aspect of it along with the spicy cardamon. I was testing this fragrance along with a fragrance from their private line Vert d which is a powerful Pine based fragrance.

The channel is targeting lifestyle products which have been traditionally advertising in print. Brands like a Mercedes Benz or high end watch brands such as Omega, Rado, Tommy Hilfiger have huge media spends on print. The channel would ideally want to provide these brands a television platform to reach out to their right target group..

The fingers were removed by being tied off as others have mentioned from similar situations in the thread. And no I don't have any proof other than the scars but they're tiny, the bigger of the two just looks like a tiny mosquito bite on my left pinky. 
One of the shortest Tests in history. The Jamaica match between England and West Indies lasted just 62 bone crushing deliveries. England were 17 for 3 at the time   Alec Stewart was still there having made an imperious, unbeaten 9   and their physio Wayne Morton had run out six times in 66 minutes. When Nasser Hussain came to the crease, Stewart apparently greeted him with the words: "It's Saturday, it's eight o'clock, it's the lottery." Thankfully England's number came up when the umpires, Steve Bucknor and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, courageously called off play because of the unsafe pitch.
People on there, some have hacked it and what not. 
Just because TSM doesn know how to play a pick comp doesn mean that the composition is bad. If Sven decided to stop inting after the first gank, TSM could have played around bot with Varus ult, mid priority on Syndra, and Shen.In fact, I think TSM composition counters SKT pure team fighting composition pretty well. 
He 14 for 32 and hits to all fields. He doesn walk much (once), but he also doesn strike out much (twice). OK, I realize Sandoval only 32 at bats into his career, but right now, it a blast to see him hit.

TSA spokesman Michael Bilello tweeted that 5.5 per cent of the TSA workforce at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport called out Friday, compared with 3.5 per cent on a normal day. He said wait times "may be affected" but that all passengers would be screened as normal.
Use translation software if necessary   it will be quite tedious, but it could work. I know I'm flogging a dead horse here, but this is only one of many, many examples of how you really need to learn German if you want to be "live independently" in Germany (ie without having to rely on German speaking friends, for instance).If you don't feel you can manage it, then I'm afraid you'll have to visit a Steuerberater. Note that they charge you a percentage of your total income (your foreign wealth also enters into it), so their fees vary depending on how much you earn. 
Yeah, this is a good observation. I don think that the sort of "emotionless girl" archetype 2B channels really exists in English speaking media, or at least not in the same way that it does in Japanese. And I don think I seen a single dub that plays the trope completely straight that manages to really make it work   usually the character just ends up sounding flat. 
I would argue PGH has done an incredible amount of damage to the diversity of roles women are seen as capable of succeeding in.

The horse is a symbol of war and victory. of success for those who take risks and work hard. play hard and rest hard. 2014 according to Chinese Astrology Calendar. it is the Year of Wood Horse. Wood is related to tree or green, so it is also called Year of Green Horse. In Chinese culture, the Horse is a symbol of nobility, class, speed and perseverance. People born in the Year of the Horse are smart, fabulous speakers who have a gift for getting through to other people. People bearing the horse sign strive towards seeking freedom and happiness. In general, 2014 would be a better year for those people who were born under The Year of the Horse.

Lisa says: "It's the longest text he's ever sent me. He has a reputation for being a bit of a charmer, and I had been warned by a colleague that he was a ladies' man, so I was a bit wary. He's such a flirt, such a charmer   and I fell for it. 
Topping is a skill. 
The research on weight, despite all the hysteria over fat, is fairly clear that "ideal weight" is in fact not that ideal. 
At the table though, he just loves to try and belittle everyone. Speech play goes in America and it can add to the fun, and the spectacle from a TV point of view. But for some reason Phil insists on talking down to all the players, telling them they are idiots playing a certain way.. 
I'm not a medical doctor or someone whose line of work ever involves crime scenes, but I think when they originally released that information, they said that the BAC was high even for decomposition (indicating the tiniest amount of doubt). I read a scientific article that said there is not always alcohol present in a stomach because of decomposition, but some factors, like exposure to extreme heat, were more likely to cause a post mortem high BAC. So, personally, I believe that it was just decomposition, but I don't think it's that crazy to speculate that it may have been because she drank alcohol.

At the same time, Wang downplayed the anti China sentiment in Washington, and said the current climate favoring hard edge competition was a blip in the overall trend of four decades of bilateral relations. Mainstream American society still wanted to cooperate with China, he said, adding that progress in the two countries' trade talks were widely welcomed and will eventually yield a satisfactory deal. To 'decouple' from China but to me that's obviously unrealistic," he said.

It took me about 30 minutes in my state to get it all figured out and eventually I got the right person on the phone that found it and they told me how to get it back. You might find a couple of employees who just don want to deal with you and play the transfer game. Keep at it .

In terms of artwork and material culture, perhaps. Modern stereotypical "Celtic" art motifs are ultimately descended from La Tene style material culture which featured familiar motifs as concentric circle and dots, repuce in metal objects and more generally a tendency for abstract and ambiguous animal, human and vegetal forms which are often combined. However La Tene style material culture was not confined to speakers of Celtic languages; La Tene style objects have been found throughout temperate Europe in regions that Celtic speakers obviously did not inhabit (La Tene style shields etc. 
Ikea's response to Balenciaga, when it came out with a $2,145 luxury tote resembling a blue Ikea shopping bag, is just one example of the quick witted reactive posts dreamed up for the brand by Johan Bello, 35, executive creative director of Acne, Ikea's Stockholm based agency. The ad instructs consumers on how to distinguish an original 99 cent Ikea blue bag from a "fake," and reminds people of just who conceived the original..

If you gonna try your luck with bouncers, go at 1am: it a bit early for Berlin, but that way if you don get in you can go to a bar, or try somewhere else, and your night is not a total loss. Seriously though, with 4 people, and visiting the city and not having much time, I would look for tickets. Half the population of London. 
The 560 Englehardt Street property which is leased until August next year was passed in on the sole bid of an Albury investor for $410,000. The owners operated a photographic business from the property before relocating back to Melbourne..

And Estevez, who missed his chance at a call up last year due to a prolonged elbow strain, has also demonstrated a high 90s fastball when healthy.. 
Pin pricks are less common than cutting but the degree of cutting is highly variable. hard numbers are difficult to get as almost all research depends on self reporting and women who have been mutilated are often so uneducated that they don understand their own bodies well enough to explain exactly what happened to them.

Hes wants to focus on his career before I have kids so that he can be a good parent and provide the best for them. He doesn want to rush into it and only dislikes it when I push him on the matter or get mopey about still being non engaged. 
The film's tone, especially in the early going, is openly comedic with many of the secondary characters presented as moronic buffoons and most of the humor being geared toward the under 10 crowd. The previous How to Train Your Dragons contained comedic elements but they were better balanced with the more serious, character based elements. Meanwhile, Grimmel is disappointingly one dimensional. No attempt is made to give him a credible motivation or make him interesting on any level. He is a generic bad guy. (His reason for genocide: Because it makes him feel good.)

Today New York Times has an article about how the despite all scientific evidence to the contrary, has conflated pedophilia and homosexuality and so is now screening out any and all gay men from the seminary. Barring gay men from the seminary has become a "top priority" for the Church in the wake of child sexual abuse cases.. 
Since you are already controlling for false positives rates with a fixed p value threshold, the question then becomes whether your false negative rate is acceptable. In this regards you made the claim that your false negative rate would be too high (your power being too low) to detect the putative effect size in your data, but you performed no power analysis to back this up. The acceptable level of power depends on the effect size you want to detect in your data, so that could mean 3 replicates is enough for one experiment, but 6 is required for another.. 
Heavy Police Presence at International Women Day Protest in SpainWomen across Spain marked International Women's Day, March 8, with a series of protests, walkouts and strikes. Classrooms across the country were left empty as students and teachers took to the streets, El Pais reported.

As well, tax breaks could be claimed for "professional sport purposes", including the National Rugby League, but excluding player payments. However, Mr Achterstraat says the audit found the guidelines were "vague on what can be funded". This meant that funding decisions "are not transparent".

Add to that the fact that Google tracking is so pervasive that even government websites are sending data to Google (often via googleapis) and now it basically impossible for your average person to avoid sending their data to Google. 
If you think that you are the ace of poker clubs, you should show off yourself. You should have your personal specialty. You must have something unique of your own, something that will describe you on the poker table. What else can be better than the Ace Clubs Spinner Poker Gard Protectors? These card protectors are elite looking, colorful and durable. These come up with solid brass construction topped with artwork featuring ace of clubs card or accompanying the letter in red, green or black color.

It was causing me so much anxiety wondering if I would be able to get enough for her to eat the next day. I had no freezer stash, and I had seen a lactation consultant pretty early on who had, it turns out, given me terrible advice and made me feel like shit.

The Red Hawk (Magazine: 1925, Book: 1926)The Red Hawk is the weakest and shortest of the three sections of the trilogy. It's not only the most overtly racist story of the three, it's the least satisfying narratively, consisting largely of a derivative adventure that ends abruptly. Instead it launches straight into the story, with only a brief explanation of the setting to inform the readers that in 2408 the Kalkars had been pushed to America's west coast by Julian 18th.

It even sillier when you consider that many people are having babies later now than in past generations, so first time grandparents are older than in the past. When I was born, my mom mom was only 43, and had been a grandma already for 2 years. When my first was born, my mom was 56..

It a lazy analysis. It does nothing to address the real problem, she said.Human trafficking is defined as the exploitation of people for profit through force, fraud or coercion, a crime with two categories: labour and sex trafficking.Experts have identified London as a hub for sex trafficking because of its key location along the Hwy.

A cheesy strat is db3 into df1 if your opponent likes stepping. Df1 tracks left so stepping right would beat it but db3 forces full crouch on hit so if your opponent is playing on the left side (which is 90% of the time) he cant step it because he in crouching so tapping down won work.. 
Now that all explains why gas is more expensive in California than in Minnesota, and why gas is pricier during summer. But it still doesn't solve the million dollar question: Why do prices vary between gas stations located near each other? Part of that answer lies in transportation costs, which come into play even when stations sit side by side.

None of which is to say that "FBI" is some kind of slouch per Nielsen, the procedural is the season's third highest rated new drama. But with an average draw of a 1.6 in CBS' dollar demo, or around 1.9 million adults 25 to 54, "FBI" is a stark reminder of how the the ratings goalposts are constantly shifting.

The horse I am leasing is toed in big time, and a teensy bit quirky. Thats why theres no fee. 
Overall he been asked to do too much offensively and the result is gaudy numbers that he had, but at the same time he taking an insane amount of shots/possessions a game to do so. When he off he tends to fall back on the flopping/head tilting that drives fans nuts.
What makes it more difficult is when someone goes from 0 to 100 like you did earlier, reading way too much into a mod action and accusing us of fetishizing women as the reason. We heard it all, we too pro Korea, too anti Korea, ethnic Korean nationalists, white sexpats, etc, so those comments have lost their meaning and the truth is the accusation about us usually says more about the preconceptions of the person making the complaint than any of us on the mod team. I don know the other mods that closely, but I wouldn categorize any of them as anti Korean and there a variety of nationalities and ethnicities on the mod team, including Korean for both.

It an understandable, human reaction for sure, and I don fault him for it nor I do feel bad for this guy. However, I think a more restrained officer could have waited a little longer before escalating the use of force simply to reduce the risk of injury.

Developed for economics, where it has had some successes, game theory didn't quite completely revolutionize that field. But it has been widely adopted by many other social sciences. And evolutionary game theory is an important branch of the study of evolutionary biology. Game theory even applies to everyday activities like poker, football and negotiating for higher pay for bloggers. There is also even such a thing as quantum game theory, which is bound to revolutionize something someday. John Nash won a Nobel Prize for his contributions to game theory, and his troubled life inspired the excellent book A Beautiful Mind. But don't expect to learn anything about game theory by watching the movie version.

Are you kidding me? This life is the only one that matters. If you have kids, you should at least be concerned about them. There may be no cosmic destiny, but life still has meaning. The only difference is, the responsibility for bringing meaning to life rests solely with you. You have to decide what your life means. Does it end with a narcissistic hedonism that ends with you depriving others and making life harder for them so you can clog your arteries a bit sooner, or is there something unique in you, however small, that wants out, that wants to be transmitted to the next generation? It could be something as simple as a love of music, or family recipes. Hopefully it will be a standard of treating other people that will have some influence, however small, to alleviate the suffering of at least one person. But that totally up to you to decide. You get that freedom all to yourself.

This is being dressed up as an act of unparalleled generosity, which is scarcely surprising given that those who give, even if very little, are apt to flatter themselves by making it appear more than it is. But what is surprising is that we are proving to be the chumps that we always tend to be when dealing with America. Instead of looking cynically at the Kerry Lugar bill and running a fine comb through it, we are behaving like a latter day Uncle Tom, grateful for the small change (in relative terms) we are about to get, almost like a tip for services rendered. America's military effort in Afghanistan costs upwards of 60 billion dollars a year. This is the backdrop against which to see our 1.5 billion dollars, which don't seem like an awful lot then.

The severity and nature of baldness can vary greatly; it ranges from male and female pattern alopecia, alopecia areata, which involves the loss of some of the hair from the head, and alopecia totalis, which involves the loss of all head hair, to the most extreme form of baldness, alopecia universalis, which involves the loss of all hair from the head and the body. The trigger for male pattern baldness, also called androgenic alopecia, is DHT, a powerful sex hormone that can adversely affect the hair and the prostate gland.

What about when it's a bus full of children going to school (because that happened)? Again, we've abandoned the presumption of innocence (the very foundation of our criminal justice system and a basic human right) and forced the dead to somehow prove their innocence posthumously for essentially the crime of living in the wrong region. And this was done not to capture or kill terrorists, but so that the government could lie about how many civilians they were illegally killing. This in no way enhanced the efficacy of the drone program, it just made it more politically and socially palatable..

At no point was it pointed out that there is literally billions of these people in the universe so just give us our 2 back and we leave. No one thought to say "If you keep our people in prison you will destroy all potential diplomatic relations with our government". Just obvious points that should been the first 2 things out the captains mouth the moment it happened and they weren addressed at all.

Indeego Spa in Rock Hill was a destination for website users in Charlotte. One poster, MustUAsk, bragged on the site in 2015 that patrons recieve "a REAL massage AND a happy ending." Three months later, a woman listed as the partial business owner, who also lived in the back of the business, was arrested and charged with prostitution. That same night, a user posted, "If you had plans to visit Indeego Spa in Rock Hill, think again. Just saw on the news it was raided by the police." Commander Marvin Brown, of the York County Multi jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit, said human trafficking was considered early on after investigators saw someone picking the woman up and dropping her off at the massage business every day. But when they made contact with the woman, she couldn't speak English. Investigators used a translation service on a cellphone, but she never indicated someone was forcing her to do this, Brown said. The ticket was paid and police never saw or heard from the woman again, Brown added.

Let break down the two examples you given and do a cost analysis. In the case of a 1 1 1 opening with a liberator it fits into your build order, although it could be a Viking to kill overlords or a medivac to do a drop. It costs next to nothing in terms of micro as you can shift queue it up and it is not so expensive. Therefore getting a few worker kills or a queen and preventing mining before it dies gives you a economic advantage as well as forcing the enemy to use their micro and attention to deal with it. However, if it flies straight into a spore or turret and dies then it definitely not worth it   you delayed your Viking/ medivac , thrown away 150 minerals and gas and your opponent wasn distracted. What would be best is if you can fly it in, get some kills, then get it out again to do damage a second time. This is micro intensive though, and if you missing production cycles or forgetting upgrades and tech it is not worth it.

We had to restrain her (she was an imposing character of 6'0) and try to get an MTI from CQ to come to us, but she had bashed the comms with her M 16, so we, nave as ever, had to take a vote on if we thought this was something we should break the rules and run downstairs for, or if we should restrain her in the laundry room until morning. We didn't want to lose our town pass for the next day, but we ended up sending runners for help. Chick got sedated by EMTs after she went batshit on them too, and when they broke open her locker, she had smuggled in a knife she bought at the BX at some point.

When you are looking at the 96 Inch Texas Holdem Table With Red Felt, you will find that you are looking at a wonderfully decadent design, and that at the end of the day, you are going to be moving forward and getting a lot of good out of the design. The design of this table was constructed with a great deal of care and love, and you will see that in everything ranging from the heavy chrome steel trim to the padded armrests and the marble finished columns..

This was a perfect pill for the military. It has been desperately seeking to re establish its credibility, its legitimacy as a major centre of political power in Pakistan, and by extension its political bona fides. It is understandable that it would seek these things, having had its image dragged through the mud by the fag end of the Musharraf years, as he alienated and antagonised millions with his bullying of the Chief Justice, and his contempt for civilian institutions.The capitalist elite, guided by crony capitalism, is a two faced monster.

PS1 Diablo is also worth checking out, for folks who are modchipped. Probably not worth it at original disc pricing, if you aren already an enthusiast. As much as Diablo is the absolute definition of point and click, it adapts pretty respectably to the controller, in that case.

The Lodge   this place is kind of a story of extremes. They never really spread anything higher stakes than $1/2 and their tournaments are low buyin. Some cash tables are awful, boring limp fests with nothing but short stacks and bets over $25 are rare even on later streets. But table 1 will also be running as $1/2, but with $8k on the table and pre flop pots over $100 are very common, if not the average. They also regularly spread a Big O game at $1/2 and sometimes will do a mixed game limit table at $5/10 with overs for $10/20. Some of the dealers are excellent with years of Vegas experience. Some of them are really weak and you should keep an eye out for them flashing cards or mis counting bets/calls. Managers seem to be the same hit and miss. Table stakes at the cash games is a nice change of pace if you have the stake to play deep.

Changing your image: By changing your image you will completely throw your opponents off guard and set them up to lose big pots in the future. If you enter a game and showdown a few loose hands and do a few stupid things your opponents will think you are being a complete donk. After they think you are playing loose just tighten up slightly and when you get a premium hand you will be much more likely to get paid off big..

So, female anatomy! The vagina itself becomes longer and shorter through your menstrual cycle as the cervix raises and lowers. It also is softer and more firm at different points. During and just after menstruation, your cervix is at its lowest (your vagina is thus at its shortest) . Your cervix will also be hard and firm, unlike the middle of your cycle when it will be more pliable and soft, and farther from the vaginal entrance.

Although I have to ask, if you've never failed, presumably you're in good shape and plan to keep that way, and don't plan to fail, why all the anxiety? Not trying to sound like a dick or anything, just hoping to see if you realize you probably don't need to be getting so stressed out over something that's obviously not an issue. If you've never failed and never plan to fail, then I don't see what the anxiety is for, since it serves only to deflate you.

So, consider having some empathy for the criminal too. Consider what brought someone to your door and to steal the money you left out on the porch.

Try taking hormonal replacements. Hormonal imbalances cause a change in a woman's menstrual cycle. Before trying this, consult with your doctor first.

Both sides didn't create this problem. The GOP as a whole has become far more radicalized since 2000, and especially after 2008.

Interesting how many of those commenting on the article think forcing the use of cash is stupid. Amazing how many people could care less about privacy.

Giving us only six months of marketing for a brand new IP from a large developer like BGS is a really bad idea. Starfield being a new IP means they will have a lot to show us of it and still leave a good bit for us to discover on our own once we have the game. They want to introduce us to the basics of the story, the alien races we will encounter, the game play and the worlds for us to explore (which can still be done without giving away too much)..

Poker tournaments in general are relatively disconnected   there not a meaningful "schedule" or "league" or "season" or something outside of a few niche things more for the purpose of tracking top players over the course of a year or something.

And Mexico, notes Daniel Villegas, an economist at UNAM, the Mexican national university. Villegas says, "Trump has threatened that the United States could leave or renegotiate [its membership in] NAFTA because he considers that agreement unfair for his country, and he believes that only Mexico and Canada have benefitted from that agreement." However, he adds, "one of the main goals of [NAFTA] is to create a free flow of goods" between the three countries, so that "consumers benefit by getting the best products at competitive prices" in all three countries. According to ProMexico, the country's investment promotion agency, Mexico has a network of 10 free trade agreements with 45 different foreign countries; 32 Reciprocal Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (RIPPAs) with 33 countries; 9 trade agreements within the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI).

I was in a terrible mood and kept apologizing for how I was acting and my daughter behavior (she was being very bratty also). He reassured me, but it didn help. I hated myself knowing tonight was the special night and I couldn even act as if I wasn miserable.

If you operate your business on the internet and you have what the government considers to be an "energy efficient home", you may qualify for a business tax credit. It is important to understand, however, that this applies to the home that is built in the year in which you are applying for the tax credit. For example, this means that if you build a new home and designate a certain portion of it to your business.

B) I can provide my manufacturering bean counter opinion as to why. The more optional equipment a manufacturer offers, the less efficient they are on the manufacturing line, which would add cost (more labor hours required per units built). Also, to reduce part cost, GM has historically always tried to pull from their existing parts bin. In their world, it is significantly cheaper to buy 20k automatic transmissions than it would be to buy 15k autos and 5k manuals (think of buying in bulk ). Trends in the market place also show more and more people opt for the automatic.

Giants couldn afford A Rod, even with Barry gone. Speaking of Barry, Selig showed some(lack of)class when he didn congratulate him after hitting no. 755. Hmmm maybe when he hits 756 that right he won be there. Last I knew Bonds hasn been proven guilty of anything. I think the biggest shame of the last 4 years have been that the Giants haven put a true power hitter behind Barry to protect him. It now wonder he gets walked so much. Apparently, Giants management couldn figure this out. I think the Giants would have been in contention if they just had a solid power hitting threat batting after Bonds.
Did you direct any of your winnings there, or to any other sensible investments? The business luckily takes care of itself but it has helped me out with looking for a home so that's where a lot will probably be put towards.

I want to decide how much of a role do I want to play in the kid life. Besides what I am legally obligated. I am not against kids per se or a kid hater. I actually am known to be good with kids in the family circles. I definitely enjoy spending time with the little ones but after a point I am clueless and do not know what to do etc. That makes me apprehensive of becoming a parent. Even though ideally I never have kids of my own, since I do not believe kids are a part of life that I want to for me. But if I am put in a situation, and I can base my decision solely on my desires (which is difficult to do so ATM, due to family and cultural background) I would want to be a passive part and see if I have it in me to become a happy, actively involved father rather than a unhappy, spiteful active father.

However, the other two works illustrated Sokolow darker, more dramatic side, and the company danced them with commitment and polish. The 1952 Suite and the signature (1961) showed the choreographer leanings toward stark, post modern severity, painting with broad strokes instead of flashy steps, favoring silence and stillness, refusing to follow melodic line or rhythmic pulse. As Sokolow admitted in one of the video clips, only way to be popular is to be nice, harmless. . . . That doesn interest me. What the viewer takes away isn movement invention as much as powerful context and imagery that sears itself into the brain. Suite, danced to Alban Berg eponymous quartet, has an austere elegance and formality. Whitney Hoke danced with fierce abandon, matching the pizzicatos and tremolos in the music with quivering hands and skitters across the floor.

Second, and equally important, the package is really the only vehicle that you have 100% control over in store. While your product can end up in the wrong location or shelved in the wrong direction, the package remains a constant, and once it has a consumer's attention, it starts conveying your message. Displays may not make it out to the floor, or may not be assembled correctly, or can be overlooked by the shopper; indeed, shelf vehicles may be missed altogether.

For starters, the buyin was $100 to $500, which helped the game play bigger. It disallowed pesky shortstackers from being allowed to buy in for $50 like they can at some places. It also allowed some players to buy in for more than 100 big blinds. Although, for me personally, I always buy in for 100 big blinds unless I already know the players. This helps minimize mistakes I may make with deeper stacks against unknowns.

The reason parliamentary democracies have a bureaucratic machine that helps fill out positions like ambassadors is because parliamentary democracies are messy places where millions of different opinions converge. In foreign affairs, a professional corps of diplomats reduces the element of chance by producing an army of highly trained, poker faced operators whose bloodstream is resplendent with "national interest."

That's the point. And once they are done doing their job, nobody will hear from them again.

Problems can be tough to solve, but know that other people care and are willing to help. You should know that you're a good person for wanting to help your fiance and her friend. Sometimes listening and saying "I love you. I care about you" can be the best way we can help when problems seem like they can't be fixed. Could you suggest that they share what's wrong, either with you or with a confidential counselor?
