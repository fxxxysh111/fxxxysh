So while we drinking our free water to celebrate the creation of Wal Mart jobs at a high cost to taxpayers, the employees, local business, and the environment, maybe we should also consider resisting? In her book, Big Box Swindle, Stacy Mitchell shows not only how companies like Wal Mart destroy communities, but how many communities are successfully resisting allowing big box stores in. Stopping Wal Mart from creating these "jobs" that in fact are a form of exploitation of workers and taxpayers would be worth breaking out the champagne for..

To answer your second part, for my chronic pain I have to use multiple things, Cannabis is just one of those tools and usually something with a high THC content, it does nothing for my pain, no matter what strain, also doesn't matter if it's indica, sativa or hybrid, CBD does little to nothing for me. It may not help pain but it does help me break free of a mental prison, the feeling of being worthless because I'm disabled from events outside of my control, I do wish it had that effect for everyone, but for some it just makes it worse, locks them down into a state of panic and anxiety.

Male Byleth is an avatar for male players, and while he certainly pretty attractive to many women (and men, of course), he also not off putting to the male players who he is foremost geared toward. If female Byleth is supposedly an avatar for female players, then she should reflect what female players want   and if she not, if she meant to appeal mainly to male players because "they make up most of the playerbase" or something, then maybe we should really reexamine our priorities. And I not saying that female gamers don like to play as sexually attractive characters or anything   very much on the contrary. Many women find it empowering to take control of their sexual identities   on their own terms, it should be noted, and not the terms of others. What I saying is that I think female players want female characters to be treated with the same level as respect as male ones and it certainly seems that many female players (including this one) think f!Byleth got done dirty.

I am a fairly serious collector of ancient Chinese coins and I live in Hong Kong so I would think there would be interest from the community about this. But I struggled to find opportunities. I did once go to a local school and show some coins and talk to the students in the Chinese history class. The teacher and students loved it and I had fun too. But people tend to be kind of skeptical of a random dude offering to come in to the school and talk to students. It might be better if I worked at a museum or something, but I just a private collector. You may have better luck if you have a personal connection to the school.

There is a historical explanation for why Brisbane's city streets are so narrow! When Queensland became a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859, it did so with very little public money. 
Politicians in the arrondissement are doing what they can to respond to residents' concerns: information about the street has been taken down from official tourist sites, and they plan to look at the presence of tourist buses that park nearby and consider regulating access to the street. Jean Franois Martins, the city's deputy mayor in charge of tourism, told Le Parisien, "Paris is proud to be a city that attracts tourists but also a city where people live.

Tuesday is bean day and I usually end up making some kind of simple bean situation in the Instant Pot. This recipe (using Rancho Gordo cranberry beans, for example!) is wonderful and Bruno will eat at least three helpings of it. WHUT. I want to marry that recipe. The boys eat it plain or with a bit of bread and Hugo will have some avocado with it. We top it with cilantro and hot sauce and pickled onions and avocado. Sometimes, though, life is too crazy even for the Instant Pot and then I make a red or yellow lentil soup, which takes about 20 minutes and while Hugo will bellyache about it, both kids will usually eat it. (Obviously, it helps if I slice a hot dog into the soup, but I don always do that because I don want them to get used to hot dogs on the regular because I am MEAN and also sort of stupid seeing as we live in Germany and they already are used to eating them all the time everywhere gaaaaah.)

The electoral college doesn't favor "rural" vs "urban", yes smaller states have somewhat more influence than larger states per voter, but it really all hinges on the battleground states.

I think gray and grey both have uses, but I personally feel they should just notate different kinds of grays. Gray feels like it should describe warm tones of gray, like low saturated reds or yellows. Grey applies nicely to cool grays, with undertones of blue or purple. "Gray" is only one letter away from "Gravy", which is delicious when warm and often disgusting when cold. "Grey" has an E in it, like STEEL. Steel is COLD.

"In the mid 20th century robots became self aware, and one of the earliest issues in the official robot world was to make themselves more like their "creators", and the first most obvious point of robot human differentiation was stink. At that point robots could be outfitted to stink but they couldn themselves tell the difference for some decades until their olfactory capacities were introduced and perfected. It was the "perfected" part that led to more modern problems.

Good post. 
R2: Now we're talking. The telepaths greatest weakness now is his own power. There are certain moments where he may be suspected of cheating. If our telepath has QQ and an opposing player has a hand like AA late in the tourney and folds preflop, how would that look? In his training, he would have to employ "losing" when he is "supposed" to lose. There is also a heavy chance of other players sucking out. Say our hero gets it all in preflop AK vs AJ against another player. Our telepath made the correct play but still may lose due to luck. There is too much variance in poker to guarantee a win. I would say he has a decent shot here, around 3.5/10.

Our bathing and hair washing routines are based on a strange system of depleting the skin and hair of their natural oils by lathering up with soap and shampoo and then replenishing them with moisturizers and conditioners. We carry out this (usually) daily ritual for a couple of reasons: By Western standards, the appearance of oily, unwashed hair is generally unacceptable   and it just feels kind of gross to go without a bath or shower for more than a couple of days. Secondly, these natural oils can lead skin conditions like acne vulgaris, where sebum becomes backed up in the hair follicles, creating a smorgasbord for bacteria, which break the fats into fatty acids. These create an allergic reaction that presents itself as acne.

Unfortunately, OP, I fear you are setting yourself up for a fight. Reading this sub, MIL who lose power, lose it. Nothing is good enough.

As Sisson puts it: "Epigenetics explains how controllable environmental factors the food you eat, the sleep you get, the exercise you do, the amount of sunlight you're exposed to, the social interactions you have, and even the thoughts you think or how much you laugh at a joke trigger gene expression in different biochemical ways." For example, a 2009 study published in Life Sciences Journal found that laughing switched on genes that helped lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes..

La lecture de Nietzsche fut donc concomitante  mon loignement du PCF. En septembre 1976, je ne renouvelais pas ma carte d'adhrent au Parti. J'avais cess d'tre marxiste pour toujours car j'avais admis, en lisant Nietzsche, que le sort de l'art et de la civilisation taient d'une importance suprieure au bonheur des masses et que celui ci n'tait pas forcment la condition d'une grande civilisation. S'il en tait ainsi, il faudrait condamner les civilisations gyptienne et grecque, mais aussi romaine, esclavagistes par essence, sans oublier le Moyen ge, avec son ordre social compltement ingalitaire. Or, de fait, ces civilisations, nous ne cessons de les admirer. La lecture de "Par del le bien et le mal" o Nietzsche justifie l'esclavage, selon lui ncessaire  toute grande civilisation, me subjuguait donc par sa cruaut. Une cruaut insparable de sa passion de la vrit : pour Nietzsche les hommes se cachent la vrit pour ne pas avoir  en ptir. Ils prfrent la scurit que procure l'illusion.

Oh I'm sure their ancestors wanted to clear their name because of how cannibalism was looked at by society. But they also didn't find any human bone at the site is what really makes people question the cannibalism claims. There should've been bone left as signs of cannibalism and eating and such but I don't believe they found any. But maybe they buried their bones after they eat them. Maybe the animal bones the found and studied weren't left by the donner party either. You really only have eyewitness accounts from interviews saying it occurred.

Most facilities warehouse instead of training their staff to be good mental health workers. It can be a little expensive in hiring and training new staff when you are forced to get rid of bad ones but the cost is only a small percentage of the overall cost. Unfortunately, many place cut costs to the bone.

So the fear is very real and it not because of how likely it is to happen statistically but that you can end up in one of these spaces where you have no chance of justice. In fact the rarity shouldn be used as an excuse to play down this fear, it is more often than not the unlikely event that is the most horrifying.

He fought with the attitude that he had it in the bag and was never in any danger. Which is dumb and risky, but ultimately he was right, he was way better than Stephens and won handily, and was never close to any trouble. His flashy shit never has a big impact and usually misses, I think he just does it for fun cuz he knows he can afford to and wants to keep himself entertained.

My husband and I had this happen to us when we were first married, a very kind older lady was moving and sold us basically all the furniture we needed for about $150 when it was probably worth $2000+ (it was not very old and decent quality   couch, dining table and chairs, coffee table, end table, bed frame, mattress, bookshelf, rugs, tv stand, everything.). We've been slowly trying to pay it forward by giving away pieces for free to families in need as we replace/resize our things.

But it a big pot regardless, because there are a good number of both colors of chips in the pot. Before this second (and final) round of betting, there are 7 silver chips and 5 gold chips in the pot. In the brief glimpse we get of the table, everybody seems to have somewhere around 10 15 of each colored chip in their stacks.

If you focus your armor on the front of your ship turning power becomes far more important to keep the enemies fire concentrated there. This allows you to gamble by sacrificing protection from the sides and concentrating on just the front, giving more space for power and weapons. This type of approach is super evident for a ship like the hammerhead, but can also work well for long slender ships or ships with support craft.
Haba games asap. The moment she showed an interest in Candy Land from preschool, I tracked down My First Learning Zoo, but most of them would work too. And I gave it to her. The key here is the production value is high. SHE had a game with solid wood tokens and chips and a board "like Daddy's", and it was hers. Things like that really resonate with a child. She never picked up the crappy plastic and cardboard version of Candyland again.

As much as we'd all love to see Pacquiao smash Timothy Bradley in a rematch, it doesn't make sense to pit these two bulldogs against each other considering the June bout drew less than a million PPV, something which hasn't happened to a Pacquiao card since the Joshua Clottey fight. Bradley didn't earn the title, and fighting him again would only lend credence to the notion that Pacquiao could have been involved in "the fix." A Pacquiao Bradley rematch would also seem to justify the impaired decision that resulted from "the scorecard heard 'round the world," and would ultimately send the wrong message to fans..

Hera UV Mist Cushion Ultra Moisture in 13: Tried this a few years ago and found it too drying. Not sure if they reformulated or my skin has changed, but right now it has just the right amount of glow and light to medium coverage. However 13 is still a tad dark for me, but this is a yellow toned cushion. For the formula and price, reasonably good value.

Brendan probably would have been convicted in 48 or 49 of the 50 states because it is extremely difficult for jurors to understand how or why people would confess to crimes they didn commit. You can take your average 12 people off the street and expect them to know anything about how coercive police interrogations can be, or how vulnerable people like Brendan are.

4. TABLET SUPPORT OFFERS A FUN DISTRACTION: But I don think it a game changer. It more of a way to get core and casual gamers to play together. The free Companion App on iOS and Android pits the console player against the one holding the tablet. For the person with the controller, it a checkpoint race while the opponent with the touchscreen has a more fascinating job. They have to stop the driver by manipulating the ctOS. To do that, the tablet player has to move a roving heliccopter near the vehicle and that earns them points.

The fundamental purpose of written rules is to be the final say about the game. What you really want to say here is "this is how I feel the game should be played" but we simply cannot open the door to this kind of behavior. There is logically no difference between this VMT trick and the 0" charge when it was first used because both are/were within the letter of the rules.

Incredibly, Mark Newhouse has survived back to back 6,000+ player fields to qualify for the final table. Unlike last year, Newhouse, a WPT Champions Club member, will be coming into final table not only having the advantage of having survivedthe November Nine experience, he is also in better chip position compared to last year. Although he won't start as the chip leader, it's hard not to pick Newhouse as one of the heavy favourites to win in November..

Unfortunately, unlike Thomas Friedman's helicopter visits to Afghanistan, I did not have an armed escort and a narrative spewing machine accompanying me to Lyari. I ended up in Lyari because my hosts in Karachi, brilliant young reporter Shehryar Mirza and entrepreneur (and sometimes columnist) Shakir Husain consumed substantially more nahari than I did on Burns Road that night. This meant that I, an Urdu speaking Mohajir who has not lived in Karachi since the early 1980s, was assigned the responsibility to drive the festive group home.

The layout of this chip is similar to the wildly popular Venetian Poker room casino chip. The inlay itself uses a group of evergreen trees as its fictitious logo, but conveys a rugged outdoor's theme. The fictitious casino destination "Bluff Canyon Casino" is written on top of each chip.

And by the way, Harry, I understand what you're trying to do, you're trying to deflect the fact that jobs numbers are bad, that Americans are out of work, and you're trying to throw anything up on the screen that will grab attention away from the fact that the policies of the White House haven't worked to put Americans to work, and the policies of the Senate haven't even gotten a budget in place for three years."

The overclocking part makes everything much more expensive. 
If the two pair is the only two pair hand, the value of the kicker is irrelevant as the two pair will win over a high card hand. If the players both have two pair, the highest pair will win regardless of the kicker. According to your question I'm guessing that one of the two pair hands is nines and the other is sixes, in this case the Ace is irrelevant because the nines beat the sixes.

Would would you do?And I should mention that a couple months ago he emailed me when he was at work saying that he was unhappy at his job and that he wants to pursue poker or golf and asked if I would be ok with it. I wrote back saying I wouldn't be happy about it and if that's what he really wanted to to, then we would need to do couples therapy too so I wouldnt go crazy from my trust issues. He never responded and we never talked about it again. Guess he just decided to go with ot anyways and not tell me so he wouldnt have to do couples therapy?
I mean I agree things are definitely heightened/exaggerated but I always saw it as being staged as a tragic melodrama, as many Darren Aronofsky movies are (the first sounds of the film are a symphony warming up, as if you were in a theater about to watch some operatic performance). The theme of the film is not "drugs are bad" but how addiction and the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream can get tangled and lead to one's self destruction, in this case it's characters using drugs to obtain that goal. So objectively yes, drugs like opiates and uppers can be very bad for you, people have gotten infections from using dirty needles, whored themselves out to maintain an expensive drug habit, get jailed for holding drugs, and have died/been irreparably damaged from legal drugs. I never got the sense that the movie was saying "try drugs once and you'll die" but saw it more as using all the tools of the medium of film to depict a tragedy of people who have good intentions but continue down a path that will inevitably lead to their own annihilation (a common theme of Aronofsky's movies).

Those nerves can be numbed. 
Have them give you information on what other adjustments you should make. The amateur pro loves to talk about their strategy. Frequently congratulate them on good hands (even if played terribly   especially if played terribly, so they do it again). Build a rapport. Perhaps give away some useless knowledge about your own strategy or bring up a couple poker terms they likely to have read about to make them feel like part of the "in crowd". Soon they be telling you what they had after they fold and talking to you about why they did what they did. You can use every bit of info they give you against them in future hands.

One of my favorite bits to compose for this blog is the Found Book Art series which is odd because there isn even a category for it. In any event, I like them; I probably like them even more if I hauled out one of the microscopes and did some close work on them. today, though, I just looking at this pretty spine of the journal Observations sur la Physique sur l Naturelle et sur les Arts of 1787 contains a seminal contribution1 by Ben Franklin on the Gulf Stream. These are details of:1. de la Lettre de M. Benjamin Franklin, a M. Mongez, and M. de la Metherie, in the issue for July December 1787, volume 31, and Printed in Paris at the Bureau of the Journal de Phyique, 1787.
For example, while a particular 8 year old and 14 year old may have similar abilities in maths, they will hugely different in their level of emotional maturity and behaviour regulation, meaning they have very different needs in terms of learning environment and teaching style. Similarly, while every individual matures at their own rate it still falls within a normal distribution, so the majority of kids do roughly match each other in terms of social, physical and cognitive development. So yes, while grouping students by age rather than ability does negatively affect student learning at the highest and lowest ends of the ability curve, it also maximizes developmental uniformity which positively affects their social development and their ability to bond with others (and together these things are equally if not more important than hard skill development). 
Second, it was never tested on children. I'm not sure why not. Third, it didn't cover all strains.

Tax return reports last years income. Landlord need to know if applicant's current income is sufficient to cover rent and other expenses. Typically, Landlord wants tenant's monthlyincome before taxesto be approximately 3 times the monthly rent. For example, if rent is $1,000 than tenant's monthly income should be at least $3,000 to cover rent and other personal expenses. How do you verify self employed person's income? Request last 3 months of personal bank statements (not business bank statements because the tenant's business is not signing the lease, the business owner   the person is signing the lease so you want to verify his personal income). If the business owner does not have personal bank account in which he deposits personal income, than the business owner's income can not be verify and therefore do not rent to this person. Also you do not want his business bank account because thebusiness has their own expenses and as stated before the business is not signing the lease. Also keep in mind the the business should be established for at least 1 year because of the high risk of new business failing. There are more details that should also be considered.

Now, every poker hand starts with a forced bet, which is the initial wager that is placed in order to have action on the table, otherwise a player would have the option of folding until he has the hand that suits him the most. In Texas Hold Hold Em' and Omaha, this is known as a blind, and there is a big and small blind (approximately half of the big blind).

Consistency is key! Use an erg score calculator to help you find the split you need to maintain then find that split within the first ten strokes and HOLD IT. You're going to have a lot of adrenaline coursing through you in the first 500 and your body is going to want to go harder but you must resist the urge. You and your coach can decide when you want to start your sprint at the end but I suggest you start when you have 300 m to go. Then you EMPTY YOUR TANK. I did a lot of research on the best method for a 2k and this plan worked really well for me. I PB'd with this method. The other good thing to do is practice your race plan. Do several practice 2ks with your method of choice so you know what to expect mentally on race day. You can probably get some soups down to $1/serving. Just google recipes until you find ones that you like. Buy bullion instead of liquid stock to save money. Two very cheap and very nutritious ingredients are lentils and spinach. Buy NON PACKAGED spinach though as it's much cheaper. Just buy the fresh bunch for about $1. Wash it thoroughly as spinach is grown in sand and it's gritty. Add it to literally everything you eat for extra nutrition. Probably the cheapest protein you can get is canned tuna. One of my favourite cheap meals is tuna quesadilla with miso soup. Good luck!
I think that this is a case that no one will ever know what exactly happened or who is guilty or innocent. I think that Wisconsin is just so corrupt and that because the FBI had a hand the cover up will continue at all costs. To blow this case wide open, in my mind, we need evidence that is indisputable.

Dogs often seem to have limitless energy and robust constitutions, but don't let this fool you: they are susceptible to all sorts of maladies, ranging from mild to life threatening.

Yes, dogs are energetic and robust by nature, but it's your job to help keep them that way.
