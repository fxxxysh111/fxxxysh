In C, just about any recursive call consumes stack space, and stack is tracked separately with a much lower limit than heap space. In Haskell (with a non ancient GHC) many recursive functions run without using up increasing stack, either by tail call optimization or by laziness.

New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know.

You can start to wean the baby badger when its permanent incisors come out. At this point, you can feed it blended meats as well as wet, canned or dry dog food. At 8 weeks old, soft baby food as well as scrambled eggs can be introduced. Start giving chopped meat and puppy dog food with milk at 10   12 weeks. By the time the baby badger is between 12   13 weeks, milk feeding should be down to two times a day until it can be stopped totally. Depending on the weaning progress, shifting from milk and soft foods to minced meat, dead mice and chicks will happen between the 10th to 14th weeks.
So rest assured that when your time in this current meatsuit is complete, you will reunite with members of your soul family in order to plan your next grand adventure.

The weakened economy has been accompanied by crippling deflation that has discouraged consumption and investment and weighed down wages and growth.

That being said, I think it would probably take someone here a while to figure out where we keep the ladders, then actually get one and bring it to the spot they want to go up. I would think in a school the ladders would be locked up as well, teachers would have no access to them.

Well. I actually plan to get another credit card. It's his card to use. My only condition was he was to send me the limit of the credit card in cash for me to put in a separate high yield savings account. In the even my he doesn't pay. Also in that instance he would also have to refill the difference in the account before the next billing cycle plus pay whatever he uses. But otherwise he is to pay the balance the entire month. Two consecutive months of him not paying off a balance would result in me closing the credit card, because I don't mess around with my credit regardless of if you are family or not.

Also, just as important, is to pat yourself on the back for the progress you DO make. Measurable progress is motivation best friend. Set metrics for yourself: I want to read 10 pages without looking up Kanji, I want to watch a whole episode without subtitles.

What's up with so many people really hating playing short handed at the casino? I'm very fortunate that I got to play few hours of short handed (4 players) loose 2/3 play for about 2 hours before breaking the game but with the normal set of regs this game would have died at 6 or 5 handed easily. I love shorthanded because you (a) see more more hands which increases the opportunities to exploit a skill edge (b) get to play looser and play more interesting hands which also lets you use that skill edge and (c) way more elbow room. Anybody here refuse to play shorthanded or know of any reason other than "I wanna see the most hands possible without paying blinds" ?.

This differs significantly from street prostitution and is perhaps one reason why violence toward these workers is fairly rare.

Its amazing what positive impact daycare has on a child. I use to believe that being a stay at home parent was more benifical but what are they learning? Unless you know the fundamental basic of motor skills and cognitive curriculum learning, a child who is home all the time doesnt generally learn and develop as quickly as those who do. Besides if it helps a child learn and the parent gets independance to work and support themself there should be more of this, more support. I just said in a post above that if a single parent can not afford to send their child to daycare that there should be reduced fee Im pro life for sure, but if you are making positive decisions to better your child(and your) future, then why shouldn we as a society help to support that!

The truth is, humans do this weird thing when approached by other humans  we try to make the situation work. Erving Goffman described this behavior as dramatulurgical. In other words, every interaction is like a mini play and we, the actors, will go out of our way to make the "definition of the situation" work. Other sociologists and social psychologists have proven this over and over again. Researchers have convinced people to jail other people, to supposedly administer painful electric shocks to strangers, even to change the price they were charging for shoes at Bloomingdales. Why? Because humans are pretty likely to try and communicate and keep the "drama" flowing smoothly  at least until the other person walks out of the room and "backstage" behavior can begin  where you dissect what was "wrong" with that actor and maybe even go to the police.

It seems Porsche got penalties for every nitty gritty shit, while Lotterers dick move was not even considered for being under investigation?I love Lotterer, he is the best sportscar driver in the world right now, but that move in the tight left hand corner against the 2 Porsche was pretty shitty in my opinion.

I pretty much saved her lifeAll of those who were arrested, charged and convicted, with the exception of Millar, were involved in Windsor drug subculture, the court heard. What was about Millar presence, said her defence lawyer Daniel Topp, is that doesn use drugs she was simply there. said his client had a troubled upbringing and suffers from social anxiety and a of other mental health issues. Despite being a first time offender, he conceded the offence for which she was convicted is serious and denunciation. acknowledged Millar difficult life and background, but he told the court that her description of the violent incident in question, as detailed in a pre sentence report, no sense. that report, which assists the judge in determining the sentence to be served, Millar is quoted as saying that was shooting each other for fun. was nothing fun about the scene described at the time by Obirek to the Star. She was convinced she had into the middle of an almost murder and that pretty much saved her life.
This is basically what I have been doing since April last year. She made it clear in a discussion we were having that she doesn like to tell me when she feels negatively about something when she knows it "not a popular opinion" so she rather pretend.

So I withdrawn and only respond when she reaches out and she gets nothing from me. It definitely cut down on the drama, but every now and then gems like this come out.

Nothing: If your hold cards are unsuited and lower than at least 1 of the cards in the flop, you have 6 outs to achieve a pair. For example, say you drew a 5 and a 9. Any of the 3 remaining 5's or 9's in the deck would give you at least a pair. Therefore, you'd have 6 outs for the turn and river.

When it comes to Warrant Officers, the USAF does not have the long history of it that the Army and Navy does. When the E 8 and E 9 pay grades came into existence for the USAF in 1958, the leadership used it as a method to phase out Warrant Officers positions. So yes, in some manner the USAF's age is a contributing factor to why they don't have Warrant Officers..

Russia knows exactly who's sitting around this poker table: It's not Cyprus that they're playing, it's the EU.

Idiot: The point of the exercise was to research and present. You got to skip the research part because you spoke about yourself. You got to avoid issues with presenting because you are an expert on yourself and can draw on limitless information when talking. What should have happened was you did a bunch of research and presented the information you found. Along the way you would have had to build up sufficient topics to speak about, familiarize yourself with the information in order to summarize it, then present it to the group confidently and effectively. Everyone else would have had to memorize the report or master the subject matter, otherwise they awkwardly glance down at their materials over and over.

Si j'prouvais un tel choc, c'est que la lecture de "Par del bien et mal",  laquelle succda "La Gnalogie de la morale", me dlivrait d'un fardeau pnible ; non pas celui du christianisme, comme on pourrait s'y attendre   je faisais plus ou moins profession d'athisme   mais celui du communisme. Car  l'poque je me croyais encore communiste. J'avais adhr au Mouvement des Jeunesses Communistes  quinze ans et je croyais au sens de l'histoire. Or la lecture de Nietzsche pulvrisait ces certitudes. Nietzsche dsacralise compltement l'histoire, notamment celle de la Rvolution franaise. Pour lui, un des principaux moteurs de la Rvolution franaise ne fut pas le dsir de justice mais le ressentiment qui habitera son credo galitaire. J'tais boulevers par ce que je lisais  ce sujet car j'avais prouv cette puissance de ressentiment chez les jeunes communistes que j'avais ctoy  Aix en Provence. Je n'avais pas connu, parmi eux, le sentiment de partage et de fraternit que j'avais ressenti, par moment, avec les catholiques que je frquentais depuis mon enfance. Un jour, un responsable communiste venu  ma rencontre aprs avoir lu une lettre que j'avais envoye  la direction du PCF concernant sa stratgie   j'tais trs prtentieux, comme on l'est souvent  cet ge   m'avait dit avec un srieux que je juge aujourd'hui comique, en regardant la rsidence bourgeoise o j'habitais : "Profites en bien parce que cela ne durera pas longtemps", comme si la rvolution tait imminente et que la maison o nous vivions allait nous tre confisque. La rsidence des Floralies, qui se trouve traverse Saint Pierre, tout prs du stade d'Aix en Provence est encore l tandis que le PCF a, lui, quasiment disparu du paysage politique.
