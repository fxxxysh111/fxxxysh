Woh there tapeworm. I joined to post an honest question for my own freewill to choose whether to use a a product thats all. I'm not looking for an easy way to train or a quick fix just ways of getting more out of the time i have and the training i do. I dont see anything wrong with using technology to help but you wrongly assumed i just dont put the effort in. If you or your riders dont use vitamins or protein or other technology that may help them thats your choice but you only have to look at team GB, Sky, Garmin etc that using such "voodoo" can make a big difference. My point about supplements was science in sport. I take it you only drink water on the bike and have home made energy food no fancy newfangled gels and certainly dont use heart rate monitors or power meters just time on the bike! Science can help if you use the data. I take it from your back lash of me mentioning pros use of items with disdain that you coach pros if they have the time to put 3 to 4 hours every day in to train. Im shocked at the response everyone else who replied has done so emparting their thought and views without implication and I thought cyclists were a friendly bunch may be i missjudged the website. I apologise if ive offended anyone it was only an opinion i was after

I can only imagine that you equating bare feet and the dusty environment with poverty and despair(?) If that the case I should tell you that in my part of Africa it is quite normal for kids (whatever race) to play outside without shoes if you don have to go very far from home. It quite safe and much more comfortable than wearing shoes all day. As for the dust, while it does drive caregivers nuts it washes off at the end of the day.. 
During a series of legal disputes (ongoing as of early 2012), Reuter has claimed that Jax violated its licensing agreement, which would provide grounds for contract termination.

Justifying that there is no such valuation in Z[sqrt( 5)] would be difficult if you did it in a straightforward way, but showing that Z[sqrt( 5)] does not have unique factorization is fairly straightforward and immediately means we can have a UFD, much less a Euclidean domain.

A couple of weeks I happened to catch General Musharraf speaking to the "public" from the Presidency in Islamabad when he was speaking about benevolent dictatorships and how good they can be for a country   he was doing so with a complete poker face and I couldn't believe that his handlers had not given him a script or talking points before this question/answer session. Dictatorships   benevolent or not are a thing of the past and shouldn't really be discussed in polite company especially by dictators themselves. Once I got past the lecture on benevolent dictatorships I had to switch over to the Tom Jerry marathon which is far more entertaining..

Rio Branco, the capital of the northwest Brazilian state of Acre and the most populated county in the state, was chosen to be a site of Transoceanic Highway, a major project that connects Rio Branco to the two main ports in Peru. This encourages trade between Peru and Brazil and opens a market for importing food products and building materials, which Peru is eagerly anticipating, especially with the construction boom and the infrastructure projects that are currently underway for the FIFA World Cup 2014.

That doesn't mean it's not a good style, I've loved COD since MW2. It looks decent for a game, but i just don't understand how anyone can think Blackout looks better than PUBG. Blackout looks like they took all the maps and assets from games from 2010 and threw them all into a map.

ComfortThe foot is a very effective regulator of body temperature due to the blood vessels, which pass very close to the surface, radiating heat and thereby cooling the blood. This is often put into practice by kicking off the shoes at work3, dangling the feet in a pool or stream, or by sticking a foot out from under the bed covers4. All of these actions are known to have a beneficial cooling effect, reducing tiredness or producing restful sleep..

One thing I think most people don realize is that we are literally one of the only large subreddits on the site that has a meta subreddit with this level of transparency and mod interaction. 99% of other subs have nothing like this and their community relations are better for it.

A. The bookshop began as a hobby in a garage back in 1983, a real bookstore in 1984, and found its present home in Onehunga, Auckland, in 1988. It was founded on my passion and obsession for books of all kinds, and I believe we have created a store with an essence of magic, pleasure and surprise, a repository of learning, knowledge and entertainment. The books in the shop are complemented by the store itself   a several storey 19th century chaotic shambles of a timber building with well worn wooden stairs and original wallpaper still hanging (just) from the walls. It is both a cultural icon and an economic anachronism with a unique bookish atmosphere available to all incomes and tastes.
More riskier ways to go about it are pretty obvious, like sex in public places with no barriers between the exhibitionists and their voyeurs. In the dark corner of a club, or supposedly some nude beaches.

Besides sorting through volumes of court documents, the Herald also began the process of trying to locate Epstein's victims   most of whom were labeled in court documents as Jane Does in order to protect their identities as minors. Reporter Julie K. Brown was able to identify about 80 possible victims, now in their late 20s and early 30s. She located about 60 of them who live around the country and abroad. Eight were willing to talk about the case   four of them on the record. Many of the women said they had never told anyone of the abuse because they were too ashamed and already felt that the criminal justice system had failed them.

JD: I say so. It really depends on where certain players are from. There are a lot of American players. All of those guys are mostly basketball or football fans. Hockey is big with the Canadians. The European guys also enjoy it, though. There are some players from Finland and Sweden. But, as far as Canadians go, there a big rivalry with the guys from Toronto. They all good friends of ours, but we tend to make fun of them because of how the Maple Leafs are doing. It kind of a funny banter that been going on for years now.

So no they wouldn't "go back" to no bonuses because they always had them.Secondly requirements for gems and gear are entirely necessary for balancing. You wouldn't want a 21 Wrath aura being able to be used by a level 1 character so they give it a level requirement. Then you wouldn't want Shadows and Rangers being able to use strong strength based gear willy nilly so they need stat requirements too.

This goes without saying that it takes approximately 150g of soy to get the same amount of protein (20g) as 80 90g of meat. The average person needs approximately 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight, which is estimated to be 46g per day for women and 56g per day for men on average, so for the sake of math we say each human needs, at minimum, 50g of protein/day. 
He then proceeds to kill every person they go to meet along side their journey together. It would be so interesting to lay the path out in front for the players to experience all these kidnappings still happening while this man in their party acts as if he is innocent and helping, and totally changes his language and body language once outed as the villain   let him follow the party for now though, he's at a most advantageous position and im sure he'd do the same. 
I used the phrase I used because most of the comments are saying exactly what I said. This person isn't shoving anything down the throat of their son, rather, they showed them which religion they believe in. As the kid grows, his mind will become more independent and he will decide whether or not he believes. It's a personal choice. My family raised me catholic, I changed my mind at around 15 and then started to believe again when I realized it gave me comfort. Nobody knows who's right or wrong anyway, right? So why does it matter so much if this person chooses what they choose. Also, I'm sure no atheist is ever a rapist, so great point.

This is not about profits to shareholders, this is about the ability to pay doctors for their work. If a hospital isn making enough money because the government can or won pay them what they are worth, they why would they continue in that field? The only way to control the cost at that point is through rationing or by not paying doctors such a high salary. In that case, you going to get less skilled doctors entering the medical field when they can make more in a different field.

My guess is your stuck in gold because your expecting to win through dumpstering your lane opponent and you've hit a brick wall of players who can match you at that. You don't seem to understand that not every matchup is about killing your opponent repeatedly.

I find that people for whom the Konmari method doesn work seize on a detail or two in the book that doesn work for them and use that to dismiss the entire system. Those for whom it does work embrace the general idea and modify a few details to make them suit their circumstances. Konmari changed my life, but 95% of that change is my way of thinking and relating to objects, my space, and my life. The method was just a modifiable infrastructure to get me there.

Ten of these studies used randomisation to determine which limb received the intervention.

If you're working with a high end printer, keep images as rgb and pick only cmyk colors for non image artwork. If you are using a low end printer (vistaprint, kinkos, office store shops), it's quite likely that either their machines aren't calibrated daily (making the slight difference the proprietary conversion makes moot anyway) or they'll run the conversion through a generic profile anyway as part of their preflight process so you might as well do it yourself and catch any issues ahead of time.
I've been playing poker for a living for over 20 years. I started in 2 5 NLH and now play fixed limit mix games. Your bankroll is a too small. Making money when the cards don't run your way is extremely tough. You need enough money to weather the variance and pay your bills comfortably.

So the decision to remake What Women Want   a film that, despite starring Mel Gibson, is so exemplary of these tendencies of Meyers as a filmmaker   is not one that should be made without considered thought. Her string of 1990s and early 2000s romantic comedies have become oft parodied contemporary classics for a reason. Much like the early 20th century screwball comedies Meyers's films hark back to (or, attempt to update with a modern sheen and penchant for women clad in high end neutral basics), her directorial style is unobtrusive and distinctively breezy. Making a film with the specific lightness of touch that Meyers's most appreciated comedies (Father of the Bride, The Parent Trap, Something's Gotta Give) are inherently imbued with is not as easy as it looks.

Unfortunately, unlike Thomas Friedman's helicopter visits to Afghanistan, I did not have an armed escort and a narrative spewing machine accompanying me to Lyari. I ended up in Lyari because my hosts in Karachi, brilliant young reporter Shehryar Mirza and entrepreneur (and sometimes columnist) Shakir Husain consumed substantially more nahari than I did on Burns Road that night. This meant that I, an Urdu speaking Mohajir who has not lived in Karachi since the early 1980s, was assigned the responsibility to drive the festive group home. 
Yeah that's it I wasn't familiar with the term. I guess I'll just keep using it at the small stakes tables I play at where people more likely can't see through it. I still feel like it could be beneficial in higher stakes to catch the pre flop raiser off guard.

I've just grown to accept it and enjoy it, almost as if it's my own little satellite radio only I can hear, which is the good part.

Running bamboos can easily be kept in check with a little care twice a year. The old way to contain them was to surround their root systems with 60 80 mL plastic down to a depth of about three feet.

Having grown up on a farm in Delaware, McNeer got his baptism of fire in finance as a penniless clerk on Wall Street, where he saw the carnage unleashed by the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. A shrewd observer of other people's mistakes, McNeer made his fortune when the markets recovered   and then declared it was "time for a change." A graduate degree from Wharton in hand, he joined the faculty for a dollar a year.

In the case of a Las Vegas escort service, an escort or call girl may decide to offer services as a way to obtain more money for a job. According to the CDC, the average Las Vegas escort service will charge between $250 and $450 per hour. Of this, the call girl herself will only earn a small percentage; some work purely for tips. This pay structure makes it appealing to offer additional services in exchange for higher tips. It also makes it easy for sex workers to offer these services under the table with little risk of being apprehended.

The sub is what it is. When I first came on as mod I was passionate about making this a welcome place for everyone and particularly more welcoming for Koreans than it had been, but over time I realized this wasn possible to enforce in an even remotely consistent fashion. I think we done better than before by stating the rules and enforcing them as objectively as we can. Again not perfectly, as long as humans are involved in moderation it can never be truly objective, but we have have a doubt or question we discuss amongst ourselves and try to come an agreement, which is what happened here. I know there are a lot of complaints about the sub, but again I think that more due to the person making the complaints mindset. People talk about problems on this subreddit as if they super unique: having nationalists, being so negative, being too liberal, being too conservative, etc, but after being on reddit for a long time and reading many, many subreddits, I think /r/korea is pretty average.

Next, we must determine whether Gaetz had the requisite intent. I noticed many commenters on this issue say that there is no direct evidence of intent, and that it is difficult to prove intent. This is not so. Intent is commonly proven through circumstantial evidence. After all, you can read minds or exactly document what a person is thinking at the time they commit a crime. If direct evidence was required to prove intent, no one would ever be convicted of 1st degree murder. Moreover, with regard to witness intimidation, a defendant subjective intent is not relevant. Manchester v. 54, 70 (D. Mass. 2015) [citing Commonwealth v. 2010)]. Therefore, Gaetz deletion of his tweet and recent statements that he did not intend to stop Cohen from testifying are irrelevant. Intent to "influence, delay, or prevent" testimony may be found by proving a "reasonable likelihood" that absent the defendant actions, the witness would have communicated with federal officers.

So when you tell bronze and iron players to win their lane to gain their teams trust to do shotcalling you're saying nothing at all. New players don't know how to win their lane let alone what shots to call after they do. But infact it's worse than that. Your telling them to "get kills" which is the worst advice you can give a new player and ingrains terrible habits. Getting kills in lane means your A. Mechanically better than your opponent or B. Are skilled enough to recognize the mistakes. That requires an understanding of not just your champion, not just your opponents, but understanding when and how other players can intervene like junglers. So your strategy for players getting out of low elo is to mechanically outplay their opponent's while tracking the enemy jungler and then outplay the enemy team on the macro game. No bronze or iron player is going to do this. They are in bronze and iron because they can't. Just like "drive better" isn't good advice to a new driver neither is this.

Those in the north, the gogyro, had no love of those in the south, the baekja and silla, since tje two in the south had hooked up with the chinese to destroy their kingdom and unify the penninsula. Living here as long as i have, i know that asians hold grudges for a LONG time. This argument actually reminds me of that scene in life of brian where one says "what have the romans ever done for us?!" To which they list off a number of improvements the romans brought. Did the japanese do some awful things during the time between the annexation and the end of ww2? Most certainly. Were koreans innocent victims for the entire period? Id argue no. Many of the heads of industry here at the end of the war had been collaborating with the japanese the entire time. Ive seen enough pimps around high schools in this country today to know that many of the comfort women might not have had to be kidnapped and hauled off as is claimed. They couldve merely been naive girls who believed some officer promises of a better life. But persuing these lines of investigation into recent korean history will get your tenure revoked and banned from academia here.

I feel like everyone spamming that picture in threads about him without any context seems pretty disingenuous.
