A colleague and I devised a neutropenic sepsis pathway for oncology patients in the emergency department, including an alert label for blood tests. We were supported by the lead for acute oncology. The pathway ran for six months and then an F2 colleague assessed any benefit. There was an initial improvement; however, at that stage the pathway hadn't become embedded and the benefit was not sustained after we left the department.
I played the daily donkament at the Empire in London. No delusions of grandeur, just killing a Wednesday afternoon playing a 30+8 shallow stacked liveament. Bought in with a 50 note and asked for my change in chips, intending to blow the 12 in the pit during the break. I did not make it to the break, but I duly took my 12 to a blackjack table. Didn't even bother taking a seat, just dumped my 12 on an empty box expecting to lose it. Dealer says that my 1 chips don't play, whatever, I left the 10 there. Well whaddya know, the dealer gave me 10 against a 4. That's a mandatory double so I reach into my pocket looking for a 20 more but all I have is fifties. I'm pot committed now and buy my 50 worth of chips so now I'm in for 62 total, win my double down and another double down the next hand. I take a seat and play a little, run it up to 200. Lose two hands in a row for 20 each and figure that's my cue to go next door and tip the dealer the 2 she wouldn't let me bet. Cash out of the Empire for 160.

I wouldn say B+ is an outright poor CinemaScore for anything short of inspirational or family fare, moreso mixed as you mentioned. Regardless of that quibble, though, I feel like Inception held so well despite its CinemaScore because it got people talking about its twists and turns and ambiguity of meaning. That buzz produced a want to see effect despite apparent mixed word of mouth in its time, something that also occurred on a smaller scale with for example   even though that movie had a pathetic C CinemaScore.. 
Okay, so now that you're in the mood and have all your muscles functioning for the action that lies ahead, it's time to prepare for the main course. Don't let that sexy tomato get lonely; add a side of avocado. The texture of the inside of this fruit is as delicate and soft as some body parts, and you can eat it or rub it on each others skin. In addition to its sensuous texture, the avocado also has a sensuous function. The high quality Vitamin E content of this super food can boost the state of arousal and intensity orgasm. It's also believed to be a natural source of phenyl ethylamine (PEA), the same feel good chemical that the body naturally produces during those first moments of falling in love. Some studies even suggest that devouring chocolate stimulates the same feelings in the brain as making love. So, got Chocolate?

There nothing "incorrect" about taking a low variance, technically exploitable strategy at your local card room that helps you build your bankroll. Maybe consider bumping up a few of your limp worthy hands in late position to 5 or 8 bucks once in a while for "pot building" so if you hit a set or monster draw stacks are almost always going in. Then once your stack is bigger than $200 consider occasionally making your "standard" raise closer to your premiums.

I love KM184s, but I think you find the toms will sound thin if the KM184s aren overly close. As a SDC, they just don have as nice a bottom end pickup as an LDC. That being said, KM184s are wonderful and picking them up at that price is a definite yes. If you find the toms sound thin, you can pick up some extra 57s to add some proximity effect and round out the sound. I used SDC mics as overheads and they sound good, but the toms lack some heft to the sound (even though they still sound full). Never used the D12vr, but if it works the way they say it is likely a nice mic. Tough to go wrong with the standards though, D112, Shure B52a, Audix D6, etc. All in all though, that setup as you have it will sound great.

This is a huge subject. But the basics are this. Players deposit identical amounts of money with the tournament director or website. Example, $50. Each player receives the same number of chips, perhaps 1500. Now play begins with a clock counting the levels. Typical tournaments change levels every 12 20 minutes, so after one hour your blinds will have increased several times. This is crucial to the success of the format because it's impossible to just sit back and wait for the best hands, as you will slowly be eaten away by the increasing blinds. You are pressured to make moves with weaker than premium hands, which in turn narrows down the tournament field as people get eliminated. The prize money is divided among the players. The more players there are, the more places will be paid, but the top three receive the majority of the prize pool. More detail on tournament play is on the attached link. (Full Answer)

Rainy day emergency savings   you should have a 6 month padding saved up, so if your expenses are $3,000 (rent) + $1,000 (gas, insurance, food) you talking $24,000 in savings, plus whatever you may need the time off for   medical bills for your dog, whatever.

Wow, what an episode. So, my conspiracy theory is that it no accident that those Gilead security guys caught Nick and June at the safe house where they went to meet Hannah. My assumption was only strengthened by the wide panning shot at the end of the episode that shows the house is essentially in the middle of an isolated area at the top of a snowy mountain without many houses or people around, meaning that the fact that the security guys caught Nick and June like 3 minutes after they came outside and less than 15 minutes after they arrived at the safe house is awfully convenient timing.

Whether I personally choose to verify the observations behind any scientific claim myself, there is a profound difference in the simple fact that I not only could but am actively encouraged to investigate, question, verify and replicate. Whether you choose to read them or not, would you be more or less reassured by a politician who publicly releases every email and live streams every meeting? Even if you don read every paper, audit published data or attend conferences where competing results are presented   the point is both that you could   and that someone does. And the more unexpected the result, the more skeptical replication to disprove it (and even calls of "Bullshit!") it garners.

At this point, we would just like to express our opinion that online gambling is just like any other activity, in that it is no more or less prone to abuse than any other activity performed regularly.

It's possible to fake a glass walk or to boost your chances of completing it without injury. Breakaway glass, also known as sugar or candy glass, is an easy to shatter substitute for real glass. When you see an actor break a bottle over someone's head, the bottle is usually made from candy glass. Broken edges can still be sharp, but the pieces aren't usually strong enough to pierce the sole of the foot. However, some types of candy glass can become sticky or powdery during the walk, ruining the illusion.

Certainly, classical thinking tells us that there are neural connections from the body to the brain through peripheral nerves, and, in particular, the vagus nerve, which provides information from the gut to the brain. Evidence that bacteria in the GI tract can activate the vagus connection to the brain comes from work showing that administering food borne pathogens, such as Citrobacter rodentium and Campylobacter jejuni, to mice activated vagal pathways and related brain regions.20, 21 This neural activation occurred in the absence of a peripheral immune response, suggesting the presence of a direct link between the bacteria in the gut and the nervous system.

Most facilities warehouse instead of training their staff to be good mental health workers. It can be a little expensive in hiring and training new staff when you are forced to get rid of bad ones but the cost is only a small percentage of the overall cost. Unfortunately, many place cut costs to the bone. I have worked at places where staff were required to buy their own ink pens to do their work, were forced to hide trash bags so when it was their job to replace them, they had some, and the staff were paid just above minimum wage. Even at better paying places I seen staff reduced to the point where I was literally scheduled to be at two places at the same time. Meanwhile they hired another supervisor that was never on the unit and had no clue as to how things were being ran.

For example, when you have Kings preflop, and people limp around to you, or if someone else raises and a few people make weak calls and then it gets to you, just make it like 60 70 dollars or some shit instead of like, lets say 45. 
Christmas shopping this year at department stores (also some dresses for myself for parties!) I have been immediately attended to by staff, and makeup counters give me bigger discounts.

Several reputable providers of live casino solutions have Live Casino Hold'em Poker tables on offer including the industry giants Evolution Gaming, Playtech and Microgaming. These games share the same rules with payouts going up to 100:1 on an Ante bet. Once you place an Ante bet, you will be dealt two cards face up while the dealer gets two cards face down. Three community cards will be placed face up in the middle of the table and they are common for you and the dealer. You can use them to complete your hand and make a Call bet to continue playing or Fold and lose all bets that you have placed. A Call bet is always double the Ante bet. Focus on the gameplay and use the time you have to make a decision and move or your hand could be automatically folded.

Exploding head syndrome! This is caused by the same reasons, but is much less common. What happens is you will be falling asleep or waking up, and then out of nowhere, you will hear the loudest sound you have ever heard and it will scare the holy shit out of you. It might be a clap, an explosion, a gunshot, an electronic buzz, etc. But, you didn actually hear anything. Your brain was essentially dreaming it, because you are half awake and half asleep. Here is a video that sort of simulates what it like for the people who have it as more of an electronic sound. It not the best example there could be, but it will give you a small sample experience of what it like.
Texas Holdem Poker Table With Dealer Slot Critical Overview
Antonyan estimated that the game of poker is "90% simple math/general strategy, and 10% understanding the dynamics of the table and/or the attitudes of one or more players towards you as they develop." The math part rests on basic probability theory, and the probabilities of poker are a bit more complicated because there are many more possible combinations of hands   plus you're working with incomplete information.
Poker seating is an advanced player concept, but the basics are simple enough for anyone to remember and take advantage of when the opportunity does present itself. Good luck!

If you watch poker on television, no limit Texas Hold'em is probably the format you are watching. It is most often used in tournament play, but it is also offered in many card rooms as a ring game (nontournament game). In no limit, players still post blinds according to a set schedule depending on the house rules and often are required to place antes as well. What makes no limit different from limit is that placed bets after the blinds can be for any amount up to the total amount a player has on the table.
I think Sanders plan for free college is a complete crock of shit (particularly the funding), but I do think trade schools, community colleges, and other (credible) programs that offer 2 year degrees and stuff like that should be subsidized much more heavily than they are right now. The merit of a baccalaureate degree has been watered down by everyone and their dog thinking everyone needs one. I don think that true, but I do think post secondary education is extremely important.

A Review of the Folding Oval Poker Table
As I said on another posting of the same story, all of Ottawa snow (or the vast, vast, vast majority) fell from mid January to mid February. We got 97 cm in January (again, the vast majority in the second half), and then had another 30+ cm storm in mid February. That a fairly small window for getting snowed in, and if it was after the February storm (which we have no idea when the snowblower broke), then staying the course spring isn insane if you have reasonable preparations in place. Again, we don know if he did or not, but he was alive and had been for x period of weeks. His decision may have been rational.

Moon made it to the heads up finale with a string of improbable TKOs, including one of highly touted pro Phil Ivey, who went out in seventh place, and then Begleiter. Those two knockouts came in rapid succession, and both times Moon held ace queen, was behind at the start and then got just the card he needed. In Ivey's case, Moon faced an ace king but won when he paired his queen. In Begleiter's case, Moon faced a pair of queens and won when he paired his ace. Says Little: "He was getting better than average distribution throughout the tournament," which is pro speak for landing killer cards.

Vegas local here. I wouldn carry that much on a flight, but people do. Just withdraw from a bank when you get here or wire it to the casino ahead of time. I don carry large sums of cash over $5k in my pocket. If you are going to be playing cash games, then just keep the chips until you leave town. Easy to conceal and carry a $1k or $5k cash chips on you than cash. People do get robbed, Doyle Brunson has been robbed numerous times over the years. Just don be stupid. For example, I typically play at the Bellagio during the WSOP. Last year we were playing 5/10 and a kid sits down next to me with a backpack and pulls out $1500 which is the max buy in at 5/10 in the Bellagio. I couldn see how much cash he had in there at the time, but after awhile he donks off his first buy in and then rebuys. This time he opens the back pack and I can clearly see he has a shit load of cash in there. After talking with him for awhile, he apparently got knocked out of the WSOP and won like $80k which he has all in this back pack. Never do that. Uber is great and you be fine with just ubering. All poker rooms will be busy during WSOP. It really depends on the stakes you want to play. For $1/$2 to $2/$5 then anywhere is ok. For $5/$10 and above, Bellagio, Aria and Wynn rooms have the best games. Most other places are lucky if they have games higher than $2/$5 running.

If we had no state, who would protect the rights of the minimum wage workers? Who would make sure that a person who has few resources doesn have their children stolen and sold into slavery? (And don tell me slavery wouldn exist without a state; if a person has the guns, they can force other people to work for them) I believe the point of the state is to protect people from "bad actors" (people who do actions which have a detrimental effect on other people despite knowing full well what the consequences to other people will be).

We just walked in and it exactly like you say, the windows were blacked out and I swear it was like a porno room with the single couch and the doctor office/dentist office check in window but instead of glass it was metal and had a single camera pointed down.

Given the SPR, you can avoid getting stacked with top pair unless an A comes on the river; it good to keep this in mind when considering turn options. Your range on the turn is probably KTs+, KQ,44/99, maybe some QTs/QJs, T9/98, TT/JJ. Generally I expect him to continue with any club/club hand and with AK+. Maybe he checking KQ for protection. I think you have to jam it in on the turn though; protect equity against gutshots/A high that probably won barrel river and possibly get called from weirdly played TT QQ. Might as well bet 200 since you commited with 100   maximize your fold equity for when you have QT QJ. I guess you could check back with a 9,TT,JJ, and Kxcc.

Many ways, the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks.

Saying there are too many Titans is like saying there are too many frigates, they are a ship in the game and the players are the ones who are building them.
