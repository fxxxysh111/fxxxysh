I've hired "Americans" at the same position and I'd rather have one "Chano" than 2 "Brads" because they didn't last a week due to this lazy mentality.

Needless to say, crossing the Canadian border has always been much easier than crossing into Mexico. There is far less security, far fewer armed border guards. The reasons, no doubt, are complicated, but surely the fact that the Canadian border is about three times longer than the Mexican one, as well as the economic stability of Canada, and the whiteness of its population have all played some role in creating a relatively porous border. Today, all that ends.

If our first three cards are queens, our question really is, what is the probability that i get a pair given four cards out of 49? Since we already have three queens, we don't want to consider the case where we can get a pair of queens, being as this is clearly impossible. The total number of ways we can get any two cards is 49 C 2, or 1176. Therefore, our probability that we get a pair in any two places of those four cards is 432/1176, or 18/49.

She and I started out as friends (though tentatively because her aggressive personality was offputting from the beginning), but her incredible outbursts of rage would eventually create an undercurrent of constant tension and apprehension between us. At first it wasn't directed at me, but when it was it was awful. We have had two massive blowouts before I finally came to the conclusion that the only way to move forward was to emotionally separate from any hope that we'd be friends again. The final straw for me was when she used my mother's untimely death against me one day as a petty jab, trying to get me to believe that she and my mom used to talk about how shitty of a person I was (definitely untrue). She knew my mother's death was one of my greatest struggles, and whenever she wasn't getting the rise out of me that she wanted, she'd start bringing up my mom.

And then the "figuring out" is how that person feels loved (I think it's a lot more based on individual than the love language general ideas)The trick is that women think we know how we want to be loved (and I'm talking generally here, not just in marriage, but in friendships and family, too), when sometimes we don't. I can be upset and imagine a certain outcome where I would feel more loved and wind myself up into self pity, wanting that thing to happen; my husband chooses to do some other thing, (because he can't read my mind, plus he knows how to love me better than I do), usually ending up with the best outcome.

Findings Growing diverse sources of evidence indicate that the TI remains involved in tobacco smuggling and that TI cigarettes account for around two thirds of the illicit cigarette market. The TI therefore has a vested interest in controlling the global T system aimed to curtail this behaviour. To this end, Philip Morris International (PMI) adapted its pack marker system, Codentify, to meet T requirements, licensed it for free to its three major competitors who then collectively promoted it to governments using front groups and third parties including companies claiming to be independent despite clear TI links. PMI also sought to suggest Codentify was independent by selling some parts of its intellectual property on Codentify while retaining others, leaving a complex web of shared interests. Regulatory capture has been enhanced by a public relations effort involving TI funding for conferences, training, research, and international police and anti corruption organisations. Collectively this has created public messaging and a powerful network of organisations supportive of the TI's misleading postion on illicit.

Indeego Spa in Rock Hill was a destination for website users in Charlotte. One poster, MustUAsk, bragged on the site in 2015 that patrons recieve "a REAL massage AND a happy ending." Three months later, a woman listed as the partial business owner, who also lived in the back of the business, was arrested and charged with prostitution. That same night, a user posted, "If you had plans to visit Indeego Spa in Rock Hill, think again. Just saw on the news it was raided by the police." Commander Marvin Brown, of the York County Multi jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit, said human trafficking was considered early on after investigators saw someone picking the woman up and dropping her off at the massage business every day. But when they made contact with the woman, she couldn't speak English. Investigators used a translation service on a cellphone, but she never indicated someone was forcing her to do this, Brown said. The ticket was paid and police never saw or heard from the woman again, Brown added.

Another scenario is the person with a large RRSP who is in their late 50s or early 60s. A lot of thought might go into the idea of drawing down the RRSP meaningfully over the next 10 years, and delaying taking CPP and OAS until age 70. If they do this effectively, they may be able to receive full OAS instead of getting clawed back, and in addition, they will have a smaller RRIF balance when they die and will face less tax at the end..

Put clay in the container to be stored. Add the tincture and water slowly, stirring more in as the clay absorbs them. Add essential oils, stirring to distribute them evenly.

It should last several months, but if the mixture starts to dry out, add a little distilled water to reconstitute it. Use as much and as often as needed.

In the right circumstances, however, the player sometimes will break up a flush, a straight, or a pair of jacks or better. If you do not have one of the "always keep" hands, use the following list. Possible predraw hands are listed in order. Find the highest listing that fits your predraw hand, and discard any cards that do not fit the hand. For example, if your hand includes jack of spades, jack of diamonds, 10 of diamonds, 9 of diamonds, and 8 of diamonds, you have four cards to an open straight flush in diamonds, and you also have a pair of jacks or better. The four card open straight flush is higher on the list than the pair of jacks or better, so you would discard the jack of spades and draw to the four card straight flush. You are giving up the certain 1 for 1 payoff for a pair of jacks, but you have a chance at a straight flush with either a queen or 7 of diamonds, could draw a flush with any other diamond, or still could finish with a pair of jacks by drawing the jack of either clubs or hearts.

Poker games have been around for a long time and used to evoke images of a small group of men sitting around a small table stuck in the back of a garage or basement with the inevitable tapestry of dogs playing poker on the wall above them. Poker has become even more popular recently and it is now not uncommon for a large group to get together for a full night of tournaments and cash games once a week or more. One of the biggest changes has been the inclusion of women into what was once thought of as a mostly male activity. The game has become so popular that ladies poker nights are beginning to pop up everywhere.

The Supreme Court's order appointing three mediators to find a solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute is quite strange and incongruous, given that all such previous attempts have ended in failure.

I looked after a patient who required recurrent ascitic drains and I became increasingly aware of the physical, psychological, and emotional impact of this process. Following NICE approval of long term drains, I was keen to set up a service to prevent patients going through this awful experience repeatedly, described by one patient as a "recurrent gauntlet."

Stuff like maple syrup, honey, etc. while technically liquid, has very high viscosity and can mix quickly with, say, water even if is is soluble in water. Mixing two such high viscosity liquids until solution would take even longer. So when you mix them, instead of homogenous clear solution of one in another you get something between tangled spaghetti and puff pastry.

Some people approach credit like a poker game, with the mentality that you can lose money if you don play your cards. Although it always advisable to pay off your bill in full every month to avoid interest charges, not using credit cards at all can actually backfire when it comes to your credit score. If an issuer looks at your account and sees that there hasn't been any activity for a while (how long varies, but more than a year is a good rule of thumb), they might close it.

We know that's, ahem, loosely related to renovating, but we bring this up because it illustrates a heretofore unknown aspect of archaeology: It's pretty much all done by stupid kids just running around outside.

I currently on a dating app detox so my opinion may be a bit more skewed than others. That being said, I was a slave to various dating apps (bumble, hinge, tinder, POF, match blah blah blah) on/off for the past few years. Any dates that I had since I been single have been through the dating apps that I used, so in theory, they did give me the ability to meet new men that I otherwise wouldn have met, and go on some dates.

If you have unlimited text messages that is the way to go as I always know my balance as soon as I spend money using my card the system deducts the money immediately and it sends my phone a text message with my new balance.

Even if SNC faces a 10 year ban from bidding on federal contracts, there is no indication that it would be unable to complete projects in which it is already involved. Those include the Champlain Bridge in Montreal, which is under way, and the R Express M (REM) transit Line in Greater Montreal. That however, may be small consolation, as company watchers note that the legal cloud hanging over SNC will undoubtedly make it difficult to secure new business, which in turn could lead employees to look for opportunities elsewhere. SNC will also have to deal with the other business issues that have plagued it, including a dispute with a client related to a mining project in Latin America, growing tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia over human rights and other potential legal issues. One possible solution, as reported by the Financial Post this past week, could come from a change in the rules that ban companies convicted of bribery from participating in government contracts. Officials are understood to be looking at the possibility, but the political climate might make such a change untenable for now. It could, however, come into play at some future point in time, potentially throwing SNC a lifeline. Despite the political hot potato the company and its troubles have become, legal sources have also quietly suggested that Wilson Raybould replacement as attorney general could take another look at whether the company should be offered an opportunity to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement.

It was a personal visit that media hyped beyond proportions. There was no room or cause for any kind of euphoria. Modi did manage to globally elevate his personal profile as a peacemaker but in the process he was leaving the ball again in Pakistan court. Within days, with the unfolding Pathankot scene, Pakistan found itself again facing the same old calibrated campaign that every Indian prime minister, from Vajpayee to Manmohan Singh and now Narendra Modi, has pursued to redefine the issue of Kashmir into one of terrorism. Modi is now reaping the harvest his last two predecessors have been sowing and nurturing

Also I do think that you need to see players in context of time. Sure if you look at players like linke, jeremies and jancker from today perspective they seemed like jokes. But those were important players in Bayern CL win from 2001. Also players like Schneider, Ramelow, Metzelder, Hamann, Bode, Frings,. Those were great players. Vller was just not a great coach. As we have seen later on. Just like Ribbeck was a real bad coach and Vogts wasn that magnificent either. Especially if you consider the huge pool of quality players he inherited after the reunification.

An unflappable temperament is obviously what a good poker player and a great ODI finisher have in common. But there is strategy involved, too, and Dhoni grasp over a one day game is clearly on much firmer ground than his Test batting and captaincy.
