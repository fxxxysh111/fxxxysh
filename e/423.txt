But have you noticed how much the Republican president and Republican Congress did about this Russian interference the last two years? Nothing. Not a single thing against an attack on this country. Because it helped the Republicans, and they will sink to any level to get and maintain power. Does anyone with any common sense think Trump Jr. and Trump didn't give polling data to Russian operatives to help get them elected?

I can show you how to get the maximum return out of a video poker machine, but you need to remember that the maximum return may still be less than 100%. Any theoretical return of a video poker machine that's less than 100% means the casino has an edge over you, and this takes place in slot machines, Baccarat, or Roulette. The difference is that the casino's edge in a video poker game may be (but isn't always) comparatively small; in the neighborhood of 1% or so.

As soon as the first sperm burrows through the egg's protective coating and enters the cytoplasm it releases an enzyme that increases the level of calcium inside the cell. This rapidly triggers various changes on the plasma membrane to stop the entry of more sperm like downregulation of the receptor that sperm need to enter, and changes to the composition of the plasma membrane which makes it less likely for a sperm to cross by chance.

I think the biggest weakness of the StarViper is the lack of a evade action (and the high cost of the ship of course). Getting a free evade has made the Defender a terror on the table, and while I dislike copying fixes from other ships, something similar should help the StarViper. I think instead of quick moves giving the evade however it needs to be more knife fight oriented, as Scum ships excel in that area. I think giving a free evade when you perform a hard (right angle) 1 maneuver through a title or the loss of the torpedo slot would be good. Not enough to make it crazy, and you lose the ordnance (not that you were going to use it) for defensive gains when you in the thick of a fight and you make snap turns to stay in the fray.

So if you want to make money, you simply have to seek out players you know you can consistently beat. Otherwise, the Peter Principle will destroy you. That's the theory that everyone in a field gets promoted to his own level of incompetence. So in poker, let's say you're able to win at a certain betting limit. So, you move up to the next higher limit, where the players will be that much better. And you keep doing this until you get to a limit where you're now the sucker at the table. And then you go broke."Hey everyone! This guy's playing Clue!"

The spokesman, Steven Shipowitz, added a wrinkle to my earlier understanding of the operation. He claims anyone who walks in can play, free, without being a subscriber to the National Poker League. The subscription allows players to reserve seats in tournaments on line and to use a computerized statistical tracking service, but he says it is not required to play if seats are open. It's no different, he argued, than a McDonald's prize giveaway. Shipowitz said the company has local legal counsel prepared to argue there's no probable cause to believe any gambling, as the statute defines it, in this operation.

Sorry, but regardless of the rest of his behavior or your time working at the country club, that specific interaction was not sexism or condescension. He still very much a creep, but he was not being condescending or sexist. The sexism started even before this particular comment. The comment was just another straw. Sure, your explanation might apply in another situation, where that the only thing out of the ordinary that happens. But not in this case. Also, "cordial old ladies" can be sexist, too. For example, both men and women of older generations are likely to shame a woman who enjoys a healthy sex life while expecting or encouraging young men to have one without consequence. Grandma and Grandpa were raised with much more rigid expectations of age and gender roles. It wouldn surprise me if "Cordial Old Lady" expected a young male server to be brighter than a young female one. There may also be elements of classism and ageism that went into the guy comment, but in this scenario definitely sexism, too. He even made a point of saying "beauty AND brains" as if it surprising or impressive she have both. Do you honestly think he would have said "handsome AND smart" to a young man?
Funny how upset they could get when you reveal elements of these properties that are not meant to be revealed.

So said PML (N) whip Sheikh Aftab who is perhaps the most under rated politician in the ruling party. At least half of the government functioning in the Parliament rests on his shoulders and yet he remains a junior minister. He was responding to Javed Hashmi's assertion that he had never aspired to become the prime minister. No sooner had Aftab uttered these golden words than walked in Nawaz Sharif, accompanied by a band of his senior ministers who are habitually absent from Parliament when the prime minister is not around. Aftab's description of the prime minister's life was written large over the face of Nawaz Sharif. Gone were the heady days when he relished his Kashmiri cuisine and could spare time for his music (he once showed journalists Zaffar Abbas, Nusrat Javed, Mohammad Malick and yours truly his collection of music, Geeta Dutt being his favourite). One could notice traces of sleepless nights and troubled days on his face even from the Press Gallery.

This brings us to the topic of regulation. Some of the countries that allow online casinos to operate have strict guidelines and regulations that make sure the casinos operate legitimately. They make sure the casino pays out when players win, and they ensure that published odds match the actual odds programmed into each game. Australian and Finnish online casinos are known for adhering to national standards. Some countries are not so strict about regulation and may be more interested in taxing the casinos than making sure that they play fair. There are many online casinos to choose from, and it pays to do some research into the regulations they must follow when you select one.

Today, with the economy a mess and staying that way and white masculinity losing even more ground than other groups, with a Black President, and changing gender dynamics all around, it makes sense that white men would need to be paid in the wages of whiteness.

"The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will. United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West's critical facilities in the event of a conflict. They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated. In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants."
