Here is another thing about video poker that people tend to forget about. Let's say that you are skilled enough to play video poker and walk away with a handsome profit. But why waste your time and talent on playing single hand video poker? Unlike live poker, where you get to play just one hand, video poker allows you to play multiple hands. This way you can increase your winnings and walk away a much happier winner. With tons more cash in your pockets.

You aren exactly wrong. But you could be. I can even give a number of the amount of customers we have that were being strong armed into panel replacements by competition and the FD due to things that no one could fix   false alarms being the biggest offender. But the thing is, false alarms are virtually NEVER due to a faulty panel and listing hanging detectors as a reason (no matter how small) is going to get you into trouble. The RHT thing. I dunno. I think you were on a better track recommending that they be retested. (my humble opinion is that if they were cooked to a point of failure you would have ones stuck in alarm, not vice versa)

I do want to ask how you expect anyone to possibly change your view on this. For example, between a person who wants to split a cake 50/50 and another person who wants the cake all to himself, wouldn the be recommending a 25/75 split? And in this case this is clearly not the vast majority of complex issues worth debating have 2 genuinely defensible stances; these issues wouldn be worth debating otherwise. On these issues, I would argue that the moderate viewpoint tends to be more enlightened compared to a stance on either of the extreme ends simply because the moderate position genuinely considers the merits of both sides and ultimately weighs these merits and cons to arrive at a qualified moderate position (ideally)..

Funny enough, this actually was a problem with a childrens toy about a decade ago. Polly Pockets were these tiny dress up dolls that originally came with rubber clothing. At some point they came out with a line of magnetic Polly Pockets where the clothes would instantly snap in place on the doll. Unfortunately, they used tiny magnets( about 3 mm in diameter) that we glued poorly onto the clothing, resulting in a lot of small children accidentally eating the magnets that came loose. If you eat one magnet, sure, just wait for it to pass. But if you eat more than one, then you have a pair that can snap together and pinch/tear your intestines.

Another way to kill a pregnant female Sim is to wait until their hunger is really low, it won't necessarily be rock bottom (because they are pregnant and their needs decay quicker and die quicker), but then they will drop to the floor and the grim reaper will come and take care of the rest.

I seriously not kidding. Even in his 2010 gold medal run, the 1260 Double McTwist was the crown jewel trick, something no other performer could do. And now everyone is throwing back to back 1260s as like a minimum (note both Hirano and White threw b2b 1440s). I don think anyone was performing 1260s at all in 2006, so it pretty safe to say that 2006 Shaun White stands no chance.

Yoga Yoga is a form of exercise that helps keep the body in shape. Not only does it help relieve arthritis pain, but it also reduces stress and helps strengthen joints. The mind is intended to focus inward on the body while performing yoga poses such as the camel pose or the lotus pose. Not only is this helpful in those with osteoarthritis (by strengthening and using the joint, the stiffness gradually will go away as the day progresses), but also those with rheumatoid arthritis (as a form of distraction or imagery, it helps you to focus on something else besides the pain). Your doctor or trained professional should be able to recommend whether or not yoga would be something for you and may also be able to recommend a yoga center.
I am by no means an expert on anything art, but I once went to the Met with a friend of my brother who actually had studied art. I remember him completely mesmerized by a sculpture, and when I asked him what he liked about it, he simply said, "Look at the muscles in her lower back.". 
That feature was called a "Rolldown", and the lottery announced when it was coming. Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of where the jackpot keeps building until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Winfall, if the jackpot reached $5 million, and no one matched all six numbers, all the money 'rolled down' to the lower tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched five, four or three numbers.

I think it pretty natural to pin the Tudor flag on Jon Snow or Dany   they even have a convenient analog of Elizabeth to marry (Henry Tudor married a Yorkist Daughter / his . cousinish? I don know exactly to solidify his claim, Jon/Dany both could do similar w/ each other). The Baratheons look a lot like the Yorks, three brothers, ultimately looked upon as usurpers but not entirely evil. The Lannisters are a good fit for the Lancasters, already powerful but corrupt and ultimately this to say   I think there is enough evidence to treat GoT as a kind of "Stark myth" or even "Snow myth" (the punning of which is masterful enough that I like to say it intentional) similar to the Tudor myth that informed Shakespeare plays, which themselves have very heavily influenced how we view the Wars of the Roses today.

If you have 65 cats, and are poor, this skill wouldn be hard to train by accident at all. Keep in mind cats are quite smart. So when one of the cats brings something besides a dead animal that this lady actually finds useful to her, she will praise that cat, maybe not thinking of the items origin. And she rewards that cat with a bit more affection and extra food. The 64 other cats learn from that behavior, and then go out and repeat the behavior that got that one cat extra love and food. It would be harder to train one cat to do this than an army of them. Because in the army of cats, one of them at least is already a bad hunter and just brings back random things it picks up. That would be all that you need to start this off.

That tailender Bill Johnston topped Australia's batting averages on their 1953 Ashes tour owed a little to a sense of fun in his own skipper and his opponents. Johnston, who never made a first class fifty, was on a tour aggregate of 70 runs for only once out when his captain Lindsay Hassett realised the possibility of a bizarre stat, thereafter sending his bowler out to bat with a note asking the opposing team to play along and avoid dismissing him. In the last game of the tour against TN Pearce's XI at Scarborough, Alec Bedser bowled deliberately wide of the stumps so as to preserve Johnston's record: 17 innings, 102 runs, one dismissal.

Unfortunately I could only get my hands on the abstract of the study, but here is my take on a potential problem with massage (and any recovery method, honestly): If it is going to be used as a method of recovery, it should probably be done quite a while (multiple hours) after exercise is completed. The reason for this is that the inflammatory response after exercise is probably part of the stimulus for adaptation. In the study that you mention, they applied massage immediately after exercise, and on the massaged leg, they ultimately found lower levels of inflammatory markers than in the control leg (no massage). If the inflammation induced by exercise is part of a signal cascade to induce adaptation to the exercise, then you are actually doing yourself a disservice by reducing it, as you are decreasing the magnitude of the stimulus to adapt.

In Swat, Dir and parts of Buner our army has suffered heavy casualties. If the US military had suffered a quarter of these casualties in the two months or so since the Swat operation started, there would have been a storm in Washington.

HPFF was amazing in the past, although flawed in different ways. 
As was said, this is a difficult and contentious question. But a rule that makes sense to me is the rule of language borders: for two dialects to be considered different languages, there has to be, at a minimum, a language border between them. But if there is a clear line on the map where one can say: people on this side of the line speak A, and people on the other side speak B, then they might be separate languages..

Forced patriotism doesn work. In order for CCP to create their status quo they had to murder millions of people and transfer all forms of wealth away from people to themselves. Since the people have no means of fighting and the prospect of any resistance results in "re education" or being murdered the obvious choice is to do nothing   which describes the mentality in China and probably explains why nobody gives a fuck about anything other than themselves. 
Less demand means further employees cut due to the less customers and less local/small open stores for those that can afford the higher prices. 
The military forces of Europe and the US are comparable though for their missions. European forces are mainly for defence of the continent, not defence of allies around the world. Once you get above several hundred nukes, it "plenty" especially as it will be your homelands that will be the battlefield and likely ruined. Europe doesn need much of a blue sea navy, it has airbases all over the place for defending the continent.
Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a Trump ally who has been involved in the talks, said the president "is very firm in his resolve that we need to secure our border."

Prior to going to the Casino, I had dinner and drinks with family and friends and rocked up with $200 of assorted birthday money and a dream. I dropped half of it in around 20 minutes playing roulette under the old Martingale strategy. I remember going to the bathroom just after and realising the pain of my loss whilst pissing, it hurt. I proceeded to run my remaining 100 up to 220, and gained an alcohol fuelled sense of confidence to sit down at the poker table.
The Palms began taking bets on NBA games, even though the Maloof family owns the casino and the Sacramento Kings, after the NBA Board of Governors approved the move. The new rule took effect just a couple of months after I called the old prohibition "silly" in a Sun column. Coincidence? I think .

After the cards are exchanged, determine the winner of the game. Which five card draw poker hand beats which? Review the list below, from best hand to worst:The royal flush is the best. It contains an ace, king, queen, jack and 10. This is similar to the royal flush, except the 5 are not ace, king, queen, jack and 10. All numbers must be in a row, however. (2,3,4,5 and 6 or 8,9,10, jack, queen for example). This means simply four cards of the same kind. The full house in five card draw poker contains 3 cards of one kind and 2 cards of another kind. For example, 3 Jacks and 2 5's. Next up is the flush: 5 cards with the same suit. (Again, the suits are diamonds, hearts, spades and clubs.)As we continue on, there is the straight. The straight contains 5 in a row. In the event of a tie, the player with the highest pair wins.

I would say treating words as "atomic" when first learning a language is pretty natural. We tend to look for literal translations between languages so you feel like you fully understand what is being said. I don't think it's a bad thing though. It's how you start to relate to a language. After studying for a 3 4 months now, I'm starting to get a feel for the nuance of German. What prefixes tend to do to verbs, similar to how they function in English. Or how meaning is conveyed with filler words like, "doch" and how it impacts the meaning of a sentence using context. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you can't expect new learners of a language to not treat words as, "atomic." It's natural, if learners stick to the language then they will start to understand the nuances that make any language colorful and unique. Just my two cents. 5 points  submitted 8 hours ago
Under promise, over deliver. This idea can apply to several different areas of life, but it's a great managerial mantra.

Wait, to me that is a feature, not a bug. There is this meta level where all three of them reference their real life friendship and roast each other while in character and it amazing.

Nasce cos la nevrosi, la malattia del secolo, che sembra investire l umanit e alla quale ognuno di noi cerca di reagire nella maniera pi disparata: il pratico va dallo psicologo, il debole rinuncia alla lotta, il disadattato cerca la fuga, il terrorizzato dalla morte, stressato dalle ingiustizie e dalle sofferenze cerca conforto in religioni che promettono l in altra vita; altri in preda all metafisica, avendo perso la fede nelle religioni ortodosse, si volgono alla filosofia o altri culti e tecniche orientali; infine c chi spera nell dei marziani!

Tolkien's inspirations were European epics: Beowulf, the Norse Sagas, the Kalevala, the Odyssey, the Iliad, and so forth, along with various folkloric traditions and mythologies as well as his own experiences with war and the conflict between humanity and nature. Lord of the Rings isn't especially "medieval" or otherwise "historical," even if he includes the aesthetics of medieval/renaissance/Iron Age cultures. He set out to create a mythology that would fit in with ancient mythologies and the ways that we humans use stories to respond to the world around us, not to depict a "realistic" medieval fantasy world, and people so often fail to realize that when they try to pit GRRM against him.

Anna is worldly and chic, but like her bourgeois literary cousin Emma Bovary, she's naive enough to still believe in romantic love. She resists the seductive come ons of the young army officer Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor Johnson) until she doesn't; then she follows her heart to social ostracism, paranoia, and ruin. Wright, though, understands that Tolstoy was writing about more than one woman's passion   that the novelist was painting his country and times on an immense canvas   and that Anna's drama is just the central panel of a vast, teeming triptych.
The enormous ship as measuring stick is interesting, and the appearance of the ship amidst buildings is very attractive in a Dadaist sort of way, as an artistic non sequitur.

When I was studying spiritual healing, I was also taught that we have a percentage of negative and a percentage of positive lessons in a relationship with someone (and some have only negative lessons). The positive experiences are reflected in the tie of unconditional love and the negative lessons form an energetic structure too. If you process those negative lessons and take the learning from them, you can remove the negative connection and change how you feel about it.

At one point, Benny offers to let his ex friends stay in their condo for free (as well as foregoing the past year's rent) if they cancel a devastating protest wherein one character makes a bunch of homeless people moo.

If you get to the Turn and you hold only two unsuited overcards (two cards higher that any cards on the board) with no flush or straight draws, then you should fold if there is a bet in front of you. Too much money is lost by players who hope to catch a miracle card on the river. The best hand you can make with two unsuited overcards is a pair which will probably lose anyways. .

Essentially, it a combination of both. They horde the money that should have been paid to workers for fair compensation and money from tax evasion, which actually driving inflation down, so their money worth more. It kind of a stealing from the poor to get richer. If they injected all that money to the poor, it would cause inflation to increase, but not by a terribly significant amount, probably at most like 5%. The real way to shoot inflation up is the Zimbabwe method, where you just print tons and tons of money, without the actual value (stores of gold or silver or whatever) behind it.

Currently unknown, but on Oct 29th, Cryptic Studios reported the 1 millionth hero was made in game. This does not mean "accounts" or individuals playing because an account can have multiple heroes.

The problem with saving the kursi is that while doing so state institutions are the first ones to bear the brunt of all this wheeling and dealing.

We need to get the Supreme Court to intervene to get just about anything done right whether it is fixing the traffic mess in a city or to ensure that greedy politicians and builders don tear down our few remaining trees.

I don think that this is super crazy, there are skincare products that can cause you to break out if you stop using them, or switch products. Whether that because your skin is angry that you stopped using a good product, or because it a bad product that has addictive qualities to incentivize you to keep using it is debatable, and probably depends on your skin.

When buying an aromatherapy gift containing essential oils, inform the recipient that the product contains essential oils and let them know what the precautions are or where to learn of them. Essential oils should never be put directly on the skin (they should be added to a carrier oil or lotion) and should never be ingested unless you are under the care of an aromatherapist.

Develop the proverbial poker face. Keen instincts and sharp intellect must be combined with the ability to show no inconsistent emotion, or reveal nothing other than casual, fun involvement in the game. Look carefully at the corner of your two hold cards slowly/casually, keeping them face down, where only you can possibly see. Don't spill any information; so, keep your face "deadpan," and wear shades to have the eyes as expressionless as stone and restrain blinking and shifting nervously when you see your cards   and when the community cards are dealt each time. Avoid expressing approval or disapproval as if seeing good/bad cards (act the same way all the time as part of your poker face)   this is crucial if you're playing face to face.
