Conversely, you quickly run afoul of hiring discrimination laws if you refuse to hire women for a job that simply requires a certain level of strength. You be failing to hire athletic women, or women that can rapidly develop the necessary strength through doing the work. This would be unjustified bias based on incorrect assumptions about the bimodal distribution of gendered traits, and likely go far enough in many cases to run afoul of the law.

Few pecans are too small, few shells too hard, to be cracked and broken, and to tumble in pieces into unmarked paper sacks.

But you are blind to the problems being caused by the frenzy of shitty parents and misplaced blame. You have to know before truly forming an opinion on this that at the moment hordes of parents are screaming for flavors to be banned because simply having an apple flavored juice is considered "marketing to kids" in their eyes, despite no one caring about flavored alcohol and other addictive substances.

Small parties, collecting a few per cent of the vote, don't help to defeat a party at all. To protest a protest vote, one needs to go with the largest parties. The latest poll by the Sunday Times puts UKIP on 31, Conservatives 19, Labour 28, Lib Dems 9, Greens 8, with Other on 5, so let's assume that this is how people would want to vote in East Midlands with its five MEPs. In this case, UKIP, Labour and Conservative all get a seat each, and then we have to split our piles, and we see that UKIP and Labour each get another one. However, if everyone who voted for someone else put their vote into Conservatives and Labour, we could have something like UKIP 31, Conservative and Labour 32, and this means that Conservative and Labour pick up those second seats. If everybody who would vote for anyone other than UKIP/Con/Lab switched their vote to Conservative, however, we would see UKIP 31, Con 41 and Lab 28, and so UKIP picks up a second seat again. If they shifted their support to Labour then Labour would pick up both of the other two seats, but it would take everyone, and 4 per cent not voting tactically would be enough to let UKIP in.

When you have chosen your massage type and length, the receptionist directs you to a comfortable chair and calls out the available girls from behind a curtain.

So, not a huge selection, but easy to make a good choice.6/10

Among participants with diabetes, higher average glucose levels were also related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.002); with a glucose level of 190 mg per deciliter (10.5 mmol per liter) as compared with 160 mg per deciliter (8.9 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.76).

Him telling Rory not to go to the wedding was a good move. Him not telling here exactly why was even better. He knew that this was an ugly situation for everybody involved and showed typical Luke empathy and level headed thinking and finesse. I been in a similar situation with a friend who was on friendly terms with his ex (her and her new boyfriend were even invited to the wedding). The groom got wasted and got all emotional and started confessing shit to me when I was driving him home. I listened, kept my mouth shut with respect to giving him advice or offering my opinion. I called his ex that night and told her not to go to the wedding (didin give her any explanation even though she asked). The wedding happened a few days later and the marriage lasted a month. The outcome was inevitable but I just didn want an explosion at the ceremony because there would be a lot of collateral damage and some innocent people (his ex for example) would be blamed.

It could be a tremendously difficult job, unimaginable. Another part was to tunnel under the enemy lines, and then blow them to smithereeens so that a successful attack could be launched into the weakened position.

You don't you can't you shouldn't And that said. In the old days, there were many ways of cheating at cards, including fixed decks, cold decks, shiners, strippers, mechanical devices and a variety of dealing and slight of hand tricks. The simplest way is for your partner to simply and covertly inform you of the contents of their hand, and this small amount of information can sway the odds enough to make a difference. Whole teams may be assigned to this sort of project, as well as various kinds of electronic surveillance devices. This form of cheating is very hard for the house to detect, and harder still for individual players. (Full Answer)

THE Indigo Shire has joined a statewide campaign in its determination to keep its home patch poker machine free. Mayor Bernard Gaffney said having no pokies protected the community from the negatives of gambling so the shire had joined 30 Victorian councils in the Enough Pokies campaign. "Large amounts of money are lost every day gambling on poker machines," he said. "We have to be extremely careful to protect the Indigo community and we support other councils in their battle to limit poker machines. "The big operators have been attempting to grow their gaming revenue in recent years by moving more machines to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities." The campaign, launched in Melbourne last week, urges the government to give the gambling regulator binding guidance so it makes decisions in the public interest. Of the 154 applications since July 2008, 93per cent of decisions by the Victorian Commission for Liquor and Gambling Regulation have favoured the gaming operator. "This is despite strong council and community objections in more than half of these applications," Cr Gaffney said. Candidates at the last council election were asked about their view of poker machines. "Each councillor is opposed to the machines, so if there was an application the council would oppose it," Cr Gaffney said. "We are so much better without them." Chairman of the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce, Tim Costello, said greater efforts were needed to limit the damage of pokies. "Each year, more than $2.5billion is lost in pokies across Victoria," he said. "That's almost $7million a day out of the pockets of Victorians and into gaming machines. "We need to strongly consider the damage that the pokies can do to people and to our communities."October 21 2014   12:00AM

I was laying down on the ground for what seemed like months. Skin, nails, teeth, limbs, scattered across the floor of my own personal hell. "Well when you say it like that it sounds like a paradise" I thought to myself. What they say is true, if you do not ask god for forgiveness for your wrongdoings, hell is where you end up. And hell doesn do it justice. If there a way to feel pain, the dreaded demons will find it. At least, that what I thought. And you know what the worst part of hell was? I don know what caused it, perhaps the constant screams of banshees in my ear, the lack of sleep, or maybe it was just something everyone dealt with, but it was the the constant "headache". I had this "headache" since the day I was killed while serving my country and wound up down here. I use the term headache lightly because it wasn just a headache, nor a migraine, nor my imagination even. This was real. It was like the devil himself had put a 1000 degree rat inside of my head while he scratched anywhere he could to get out. I closed my eyes to ready myself for another day of eternal and limitless pain.

Don expect some magic transformation from meditating. But the simple act of being present, for me, is magical. This moment is magical. What was the last time you really tasted your food? Or appreciated trees. Or deeply immersed yourself into the moment of being with someone else. "Meditating sets a foundation for a life of more appreciation." Tim Ferris said something along those lines. It eluding to the Buddhist idea that you should be experiencing the mundane aspects of your life as if for the first time. In that case, nothing is really mundane at all.

So, hot take, but I going to push back against the common statement here that your doctor is lying. I think they are wrong, but that doesn really mean it a lie. Here in Canada, I was diagnosed at 24 (adult age) by one of the few doctors qualified to assess Adult AD/HD. I don think your doctor was intentionally trying to harm you or hold you back. I just think people have been working off of some very wrong information around AD/HD (or ADD as it used to be called) for decades or longer, and doctors are not immune to ignorance.

"These cases have provided an interesting reorganization conundrum," read a motion filed Nov. 2 by Wagner's bankruptcy attorney John Y. Bond III, who didn't return a telephone message for this story. "Just six months ago, at the outset of the cases, the price per barrel of oil was hovering around $60   up from a first quarter trough of less than $45 per barrel   and there was substantial belief in the market that the price would continue to increase. Now six months later, the price per barrel has dipped as low as $38 per barrel and is currently sitting at around $45 per barrel."

Both my dining companion and I favored the dry rub, which presented a terrific balance of sweet, salty and spicy with the perfect amount of crunch. A splash of green jerk hot sauce also upped the flavor quotient in a most positive way.

Explore the possibility of using a reward system. Attach small purchases to the length of time you've gone without nibbling. Before your quit date, brainstorm a list of little pleasures   anything from a glossy new fashion magazine or tube of expensive lip gloss to a professional manicure or even a massage. List as many potential rewards as possible. Then rank them in order of magnitude or expense, with the less expensive rewards first. Circle four that really appeal to you, and assign a different "milestone" to each one. For your first full day without nail biting, you may reward yourself with the new issue of W or French Vogue. For the first full week, you could buy the new Dior lip gloss. Maybe the first successful month earns you a massage at the local day spa, and six months equates to a full day of treatments. These are merely examples; the key to successful use of rewards is to pick rewards that make your heart beat a little faster.

Their offense was stale and stagnant with Flacco, their record was bad enough that the Ravens owner started publicly hinting at moving on from Harbaugh. Flacco injured his hip and Lamar came in and made their offense electric and the rest is history.

If someone doesn care about you, they don get input into your self worth. There are dozens if not hundreds of people who think poorly of all of us, but we don let that affect how we feel about ourselves when we are loved by those who matter.This is where people would rather ask the internet and strangers what to do instead of getting a qualified person to help them, because to do it the right way would involve them making any effort what so ever. Anyone willing to put in the actual effort, actually get help and fix their problems.This sub is for badly written fake posts, and drama caused by people who can make good choices to save their lives.Coming to relationship reddits looking for help in your relationship is like going to the bar to get help with your alcoholism.

At the time that I joined the company, we were considered a niche vendor in the market research space within media and advertising. The technology there was being used to basically test how people react to ads, so that you can optimize your ad content and was referred to as "automated facial coding." What even is that?

Originally only hearing their songs of the anime series, I looked more into their music and discovered that there even more great music from them. They have many different songs and really expand the genre of alternative. Some songs can be upbeat, and then others get more of a shoegaze kind of feel. One can block out the fact that they don understand the lyrics, and can get lost in the melody and music itself.

People saying that 7 figures is really high for the Bucks and Cody, as well as people saying they're crazy for turning it down because AEW success is far from guaranteed, are missing the bigger picture. As wrestling performers, they might move the needle a bit during and shortly after their debut but they would most likely get neutered by creative along the way (unless the deal included creative control, which I doubt it would). What WWE is really after is the marketing rights to all their merch. Slap a WWE logo on any Elite merchandise and that's easily worth at least 7 figures, and probably more, over the duration of the contract and beyond

Studies have shown that patients treated at institutions with active research portfolios have better health outcomes and live longer. 
For example, while a particular 8 year old and 14 year old may have similar abilities in maths, they will hugely different in their level of emotional maturity and behaviour regulation, meaning they have very different needs in terms of learning environment and teaching style. Similarly, while every individual matures at their own rate it still falls within a normal distribution, so the majority of kids do roughly match each other in terms of social, physical and cognitive development. So yes, while grouping students by age rather than ability does negatively affect student learning at the highest and lowest ends of the ability curve, it also maximizes developmental uniformity which positively affects their social development and their ability to bond with others (and together these things are equally if not more important than hard skill development). 
However, when playing a low limit game, the level of opponents frequently is quite low to play artlessly and quite winningly.

The funny thing here   aside from the fact that the Enquirer put a blackmail request in writing from a C suite executive   is that the only way that publishing those photos wouldn be an illegal invasion of privacy is if they were "newsworthy," but the very fact that they were willing to not publish them would seem to raise questions over whether they are actually newsworthy.
It was never about power, it was about faith. Moses was already given a certain amount of power in the context of his staff   which in this case provided water, but also split the Red Sea and led the people out of Egypt.

In fusion the rate of reaction is governed by entirely different factors from those in fission. Fission takes place when a nucleus of uranium or plutonium captures a neutron. Because the neutron has no electric charge and is not repelled by the nucleus, temperature has no important influence on the fission reaction; no matter how slow the neutron, it can enter a uranium nucleus and cause fission.

The cuticle plays an important role in the health of your nails. They provide a protective cover for the tissue that grows new cells that build the nails. As you know, your nails are constantly growing   that's why you have to keep clipping them. They are made of a hard type of protein called keratin, which serves as a protector for your fingertips [source: Mayo Clinic]. The cuticle protects the new, soft keratin as it emerges onto the nail. As the protein ages, it hardens. Look farther down your nail, toward the tip. There, you'll find the oldest part of your nail. If it's healthy, you'll find that it's very stiff.

I don get a buzz from coffee I just like the taste and it become a morning ritual so I guess I thought that since I don feel the effects of caffeine I probably wasn addicted to it. Perhaps this resistant headache proves otherwise.

No. The three of a kind (3 queens) beats a pair (2 kings). This rule takes precedence. The situation where the kings have a higher value than queens, would become important if you had the same type of hand (like 2 kings vs 2 queens, or 3 kings vs 3 queens). So look at the highest card after the pair, if player A has highest card 10 and player B has highest card King, then player B (the one with the King) wins. But if player A's hand is a pair of 6's and player B's hand is a pair of 5's, then it doesn't matter what the other cards are   the pair of 6's wins. (Full Answer)

I'm not a big fan of her wardrobe but I understand why people are. I believe that she represents herself through her clothes and because her clothes are so original and different, it allows her to stand out and many people look up to others who aren't afraid to show their true self.

Even trips are often beat by a straight, flush, or full house. Hold'em players who start to play Omaha often not only play a hand like A A 7 8 but also will raise with it before the flop. This hand is unplayable because it will not win the low even if a low is made and will rarely win even if an ace comes on the board unless the board pairs (making a full house), and the 7 and 8 are almost worthless.

Cluster   Cluster headaches are headaches that occur repeatedly over a period of weeks or even months. Cluster headache pain usually occurs on one side of the head and is centered around the eye. The causes of cluster headaches are unknown, but may be related to changes in blood flow because substances that affect blood flow, such as alcohol, can trigger cluster headaches. Primary headaches can also be caused by too much blood flow. For example, if you have read How Caffeine Works, you know that caffeine reduces blood flow in the brain. Some pain relievers contain caffeine to take advantage of this effect. If you have been taking caffeine every day and you stop, you can get an incredible headache because of the increased blood flow in your brain. Secondary headaches result from some other problem with your body. For example, How Viruses Work talks about why you get a headache (and other pains) when you have the flu. Once you eliminate the disease, you eliminate the secondary headaches. Most headache pain can be treated with over the counter medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Motrin) and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. As mentioned above, migraines have been helped by drugs that block serotonin, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex). Cluster headaches have been treated with sumatriptan, steroids (Migranal) and narcotics. your welcome;);) (Full Answer)

One day you're scratching your cat's ears when you notice something unusual inside   a dark brown, crumbly substance that looks sort of like coffee grounds. Your cat probably has ear mites, tiny, pinpoint sized parasitic insects that live and breed in the ear canals. They feed on skin debris, cell fluids and blood, and can gnaw on the tissue of the ear canal. Ear mite infestations usually itch, so cats with ear mites will scratch excessively at the backs or insides of their ears   sometimes to the point of producing raw patches   shake their heads, or hold their ears at an odd angle.

In some esoteric works there are hints of many civilizations that have colonized our garden planet at one point or another over a span of many many many millions of years.

This was on a fairly obviously anti law enforcement sub so I wanted to put it here and get some LEO perspectives on the content of the video.
