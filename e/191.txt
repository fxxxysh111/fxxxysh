Academics live lives isolated from much of the debates and issues that structure the world outside of academe. We don really pay as much attention as we should to sports, pop culture, or even Presidential elections. Many of us spend our entire careers caught up in seemingly esoteric questions about how we know what we know, or, as academics like to say, "epistemology."

Dear Paul: You are welcome and I wish he were alive to know what had happened to him as a young child. When I think of the number of families that have been violated over the last 50 years by child protective services, falsely accused of a heinous crime, to live the rest of their lives known as someone who would beat an infant, I feel sick.
Are you sure your manager wasn just simply saying that they didn need the note, not that they didn accept that you were out sick? I not in HR, but I am a manager. My organization policy is that you only need a doctor note if you out for 3 or more consecutive days of work   I could see myself in the same situation of returning the note to the employee, seeing they were on the phone and just saying quickly "hey, we don actually need this." Granted, it nearly impossible to tell tone over the internet, and having struggled with anxiety as well, I know it also suuuper easy to misinterpret matter of fact speech into "omg my boss hates me I such a fuckup what did I do," when in actuality they just didn require a note.
I put in more effort than an easy run but didn't end up going much faster. Probably was not as much effort as I would have put into the goal pace since I was mostly focused on not falling.

The Historic Green Village is a little difficult to find, but worth the effort for anyone who'd like to see a net zero energy complex, that is, buildings that produce more energy than they consume. The brainchild of British organic baby food entrepreneurs Mike and Lizzie Vann Thrasher, it's a collection of five historic and new buildings, housing small local businesses, that use solar power and collect rainwater in cisterns under the parking lot.

The bit about paying life was not clearly worded on my side. The gist of my intention was: if you know you have Revenge ready in a few turns, you have more liberty to use your life as a resource, rather than treating life as a precious thing to protect. You can pay life for your Final Payment, rather than sacrificing a spirit or cheap creature. You can choose to not block a creature, rather than chump blocking with a decent attacker. You get to improve your board state at the expense of life in the short term, because the life loss hurts less if you know you will recover the life soon. You need a true bomb like a huge Hydroid Krasis or a Kaya Wrath then. Even Ethereal Absolution won help you much then. There are no bomb level cards in this pack, so no card in the pack could help you.
Meanwhile, real opportunities are being lost to lead by example. Sure, the US is a military Empire the likes of which the world has never seen, BUT we still have something like freedom of speech  unlike Russia, where such freedoms were never really established, and under Putin and his puppet Medvedev, are disappearing. According to Oleg Kozlovsky, the Russian state recently increased state control over speech by controlling not just journalism, but history as well.

I assume those 4M hands are datamined and not played by yourself on a specific limit? Most approaches to just throw classification algorithms ("Here, some magic ml dust, munch the data and play strong poker") resulted in terrible results. The best "real world" applications I have seen started very simple with a rule based approach, refining different stages of a hand. I guess, till now you already have taken a look at the publications from the guys of the Univ. of Alberta. My advice would be to take a look at the Master thesis of Constantinou ("Opponent modelling and Bayesian analysis for intelligent behaviour in a multi agent Texas Hold Poker environment") and come up with your own ideas.

Carol Danvers, the title character, works almost entirely because of the charisma and presence of Brie Larson. Carol is badly underwritten and becomes less interesting once she recovers her memories (which have fallen victim to a convenient case of amnesia when the movie begins). She's more intriguing as an enigma during the period when her seemingly limitless powers are constrained. Her few attachments include a lost mentor (Annette Bening) who hovers around the periphery of her past; Yon Rogg (Jude Law), Obi Wan to her Anakin; Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), her one time best friend; and the irrepressible Nick Fury (a computer de aged Samuel L. Jackson), who's on hand more often than not for comedic purposes and to provide a tangible tie in to The (Future) Avengers. (The movie takes place in 1995 and so functions as a prequel.)

Every casino game has its house edge, which is also known as favourability towards the house. The higher the house edge is, the smaller the chances of winning for the players are. Therefore, online players should always try their luck on games that have low house edge and that are not extremely favourable towards the house.
His presidency can mean bad news for regions like ours. He is a red bull in a china shop and can be totally unpredictable. Yes his focus is likely to be on domestic issues, but he has promised his voters the moon. The reality is that jobs will not come back to the US in a year. Hillary will not be prosecuted in three months or ever. The wall with Mexico will not be built overnight.

Dr. 
If you get to the Turn and you hold only two unsuited overcards (two cards higher that any cards on the board) with no flush or straight draws, then you should fold if there is a bet in front of you. Too much money is lost by players who hope to catch a miracle card on the river. The best hand you can make with two unsuited overcards is a pair which will probably lose anyways.

As you can see there really isn't much of a difference between Texas Hold'Em and Omaha Hold'Em.

I was part of the engineering team of senior classmen at the U last year that completed part of the research into using toll roads (and busses, and other engineering projects) for big cottonwood canyon. The tolls weren necessarily just for the roads, but to try and supplement the tiny budget alloted to big cottonwood canyon. The tolls would help for sanitation facilities, trail maintenance, conservation, bridges, additional bussing, etc. etc. There are millions of visitors every year (if I recall, nearly as many visitors as Yellowstone, but with a tiny fraction of the budget), and the canyons need as much help as they can get.

In the same year that those bottom 20 million taxpayers paid 50bn in income tax, the net wealth of the UK rose by nearly half a trillion pounds, yet almost none of that gain was taxed.

The answer has to do with the variance associated with two different playing styles.

This movie is a fairy tale romance of finding coming to terms of your own identity and standing your ground on what you are and what you love. The movie is shot and directed like a classic Hollywood movie filled with a sweeping eye of showing the excessive wealth and the fantasy of living and finding yourself in the high life compared to my mediocre apartment.

Now, if one were to multiply 375g by the 7.53billion people on this planet, one would get 2.82 trillion grams of soy per day (and that modestly rounding down to the nearest hundredth of a trillion). That 2.82 billion kg per day, or 6.22billion lbs per day. Multiply that by 365 days and you get a little over one trillion kg per year or 1.01 billion tons. Comparatively, the world currently only produces 352 million tons of soy per year. Divide 1.01 billion tons by 352 million tons, and you will see that the current production of soy would have to increase nearly three fold to sustain the necessary protein intake of every human on the planet (2.7, to be exact). Don ever make me do that much math again!

Maybe my deep tendency would be to darken things a little bit. As Nathalie navigates her life after her spouse's departure   a process that includes deepening her ties to her favorite former student, Fabien (Roman Kolinka), in a lovely depiction of intergenerational friendship   the actress perfectly calibrates her responses, never overplaying them while burrowing deep into her character's emotions.

I agree that it a long time to be stuck with an agent and it would suck if they were bad at their job.

How will she feel if she has to kill other robots or humans?Reinhardt is a loudmouth, but I don really see him being one to talk about things that pain him. If Reinhardt were telling that tale, I sure he talk about how his mentor saved his life and died in a glorious last stand to save everyone, while leaving out the parts about how it was all Reinhardt fault, and how he still feels guilty about it.

Make a bluff when cards are dealt that will possibly have weakened your opponents hand. If your opponent has called on a J 7 2 flop and the turn brings a 7, then this is not a good time to bluff as any pair your opponent may hold will still be as strong as before but he probably doesn't have trip 7s. If instead of 7 the turn comes down a K, then it is not looking so good now because some one (maybe you) may have paired Ks on the flop; so they are more likely to fold Js or 7s, if you betted/bluffed as if you may now have a pair of Kings.

The rituals and traditions of French horse racing have endured, but today the industry faces very modern threats: an aging bettor profile, a growing contingent of potentially untapped online gamers and gamblers, and competition from new horse race betting operators who contest PMU support from the French government. These challenges, hastened along by the loss of monopoly status for online betting in France in 2010, became a catalyst for PMU to modernize its commercial approach strategically and promote the globalization of the French horse racing industry. As the largest pari mutual betting operator in Europe and the second largest in the world, PMU responded proactively and turned these challenges into opportunities to become better prepared for the globalized economy.

In the "come out roll" there are two combinations where you win and three where you instantly lose, including double six aka "midnight/boxcars": the craps version of the roulette zeroes, a magic "the house just makes money because" number. The fact every casino version of a game has such a number, where non casino versions of the same games don't, does nothing to dissuade idiots, sorry, players. For any other result you've now set the "point" as that value.

The payout ratio is against the amount of your bet. So if you bet $5 and get a straight, you are instantly credited with $25 into your account, meaning your total profit for that hand would be $20. These ratios are roughly based on the odds that you'll hit the hand in question if you play "perfectly" that is, if you know the next five cards that are sitting on top of the dealer's deck, in order.. 
Maybe after getting the offer I should have been more demanding about having explicit proof of her claims of success. She talked a big game, but I had such rose colored lenses on that I didn press the issue when she danced around having things to back up what she said, like having a big deal lined up with a famous musician   which turned out to be a delusion based on having met them in person, once, at a big party a few years prior. She just seemed so confident and open   I wish I asked for something more concrete.. 
I personally am starting to view it as a hindrance rather than a help. Why? Because it creating animosity between users and mods that wouldn be there without it. There are many users who come here with a vendetta, whether it be because they are banned, because their favorite personality tweeted something and they want to be part of the drama, or because they have a personal dislike of something without thinking about the larger picture. Yes, there absolutely is good feedback to be had here, but it becoming scarce because people would prefer to upvote the comments that simply seek to shit on the mods while downvoting any response. It hard to have a discussion in that environment.

There are actually two different games, depending on whose house we're at. If we're at the brash, aggressive guy's house, we buy in for five bucks. If we lose, we can buy in again for five bucks. A person can keep buying in for five bucks until a certain time limit. I think this is dumb as it rewards the risk takers who lose continuously until they happen to get a good hand that they transform into a hell of a lot of money. (I see it as just buying everyone else's chips.)
For whatever reason CW decided that's not what he wanted and it would be much better to just "rid of them". It's not logical and it doesn't make any sense but it's also exactly why we are all in disbelief.

Woodbury has been on the commission since 1981 and is seeking another term.

At that moment, truck lights bore through the fog and I had to quickly swerve to avoid arriving in Hell ahead of my time.

But now, I can easily stay on my back for 6 hours, and the pain in my arms and shoulders has vanished.sleeping tends to roll you into a fetal or "desk" posture, that twists the hips, shortens the hip flexors, and rolls the shoulders forward. With 4 pillows, you can almost turn side sleeping into perfect posture! Place a thin pillow under your side, and a thick enough pillow under your head to keep your head level  this makes a hole for your shoulder, to stop it from rolling forward as much. 
Getting rid of headaches by applying slight force or pressure to certain pressure points is called acupressure. Acupressure is derived from the ancient Chinese healing method of acupuncture.

One might argue that using names like string_compare instead of strcmp adds to the readability rather than taking away from it and also note that C hilariously short names for many of its core functions date from the time that C identifiers could be no longer than 6 characters; as in they could be longer but the compiler would just throw the rest away which is so possible even worse than just throwing a parse error..

Obviously that causes frustration for both our Users and Mods alike! Contrary to what some may believe, we enjoy hearing from you no matter the issue be it good or bad. We request that you use Modmail as not only do all Moderators get to view the message no matter what time of day you send it, nor what time of day any particular mod happens to be on. Quite unfortunately for both you guys, and us alike, during those times the old saying of "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!"

The poles are relatively easy to establish: the literal camp would have believed in the gods. These stories make claims to be inspired by the muses, who witnessed the events and ostensibly use the bards as mouthpieces. The word "mmemnonai" is a storytelling word which means "I remember" but really "I remember exactly." (My Ancient Greek is weak, so please pardon my lack of a Greek keyboard, and my almost certain misspelling of the transliteration.) So for uncritical readers or devoutly religious ones, they probably would have understood it as literal. It may be that such readers were the majority.

If Richard Holbrooke or his kind assume the airs of civilian field marshals the moment they step on Pakistani soil it is because we allow them this freedom.

Recent events in Iran are diminishing the attraction of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a role model. But it does underline the importance of acquiring some self respect.

What this DOES achieve is decreases the risk that a gun is used by a household member for suicide (no bullets). It DOES decrease the risk of accidental discharge in the home. It DOES decrease the risk of a "self defence" induced friendly fire incident (statistically more probable than an actual self defence event). Gun exposed people are safer, gun users get to continue using their guns.

Novice players are also advised to try their hands on the low limit poker matches first. These games only accept very low 'bets' and is also good for those who need to practice while having the chance to earn cash (even if small) at the same time. This is a winning poker strategy that you should not pass up on as it gives you more practice, makes you compete with novice and 'mid range' players while avoiding the seasoned players, and still allows you to experience being a poker player who gets to win cash, unlike in the free games that let you bring home nothing..

The colony ship to Gliese 445 traveled at about .05c, much faster than Voyager I, and consequently had to take a different trajectory to reach the star, making interception of the probe unlikely even by the colony ship harvesting drone. The probe on display and the recording broadcast were likely a clever hoax. In any case, the habitat housing the alleged Voyager I was later destroyed in a war so it all a moot point.. 
"Becoming" part of God when you die is the warmest feeling you will ever feel, imagine like pure white light, it has all the frequencies, now imagine hearing every frequency of sound/light/etc at once and being overwhelmed at every level with warmth. That what heaven is, that what God is, the rest is just man attempting to portray that infinite beauty and goodness into temporary human words and emotions. Even Jesus didn know how to completely "translate" from the infinite world to our discrete world. Neither did Buddha or Muhammad. All of them were touched by "God" and attempted to translate what they saw in the eternal into the discrete and depending on the time, culture, environment, the translation was affected by the vocabulary and linguistic styles of the people they were a part of. They all talk about the same one, true, eternal God, all are a mix of the real thing, with the corruption of their translation by manly needs and desires.

Thinking about getting your toes done? Any beauty treatment or procedure involving chemicals, fumes or massage should be OK'd by your doctor beforehand, just to be safe. If you do get a pedicure (or manicure) while pregnant, take some precautions. Make sure the salon's health inspection scores are high, and bring your own nail files and other tools (such as cuticle clippers). This will limit the risk of infections, especially if you get nicked. Don't bother if there's a strong chemical smell in the salon   go somewhere with good ventilation, as those fumes aren't good for you or the baby.

Different cities have different unique homeless issues. What might surprise you is that nationally 34% of homeless individuals are homeless families. In my particular city, substance abuse only accounts for about 13% whereas survivors of domestic violence make up roughly 10%. Serious mental illness represents 18%. Now, there is certainly overlap in more than a few categories with veterans(20%) and chronically homeless  those who choose to be homeless (33%). I do have friends in the chronically homeless category, and they absolutely never plan on being in a home again, and in 2 particular cases, they are sober, and while not solidly grounded in the same reality as me, seem like perfectly functioning adults.

The favor system seems like it an integral part of the game system, but it feels tacked on.

That said, the legends are in an odd place with the current hit boxes and I interested in how things will change. I agree that confidence etc will no doubt have played into my different kds but it a fact that you bet mowed down so much quicker as caustic/gib vs the smaller legends (to a lesser extent pathfinder too).

For all the criticism of the clampdown, the flip side is easy to see as well: With fewer escorts advertising, prospective johns have less opportunity. And just as some prostitutes are loath to walk the streets, some johns are hesitant to hire company off the curb. Men who normally find escorts on Craigslist are increasingly scared to do so, according to one prostitute, who says her clients are equally put off by the idea police can subpoena details about their date.

That exactly how it works! Or rather, it should be enough to quit out of the game, wait a few minutes, shut down your Xbox (properly, no instant on!) and then wait a few minutes again; if you have the original Xbox One with the external power supply unit, just wait until the light on it turns from white to orange. the Ezio Collection crashed a few times on my X and Watch Dogs somehow got corrupted at one point and required a reinstall or it would crash right after loading my save.

That seems to be a common refrain in poker forums recently, in light of all the success the amateurs are enjoying. We ran a poll on my web site asking members to predict "Who will win WSOP 2004?"

One thing that I got out of these docs that I hadn really seen before is the level of manipulation that MJ showed. Some of it seemed to be very "aware", too.

It strange to think that who we are, our very soul from the foundation of our character built on life experiences to our ephemeral thoughts and dreams depend on a very physical brain. My sister with mental illness was born with it. Growing up that always how she was. I have another sister that has suffered a traumatic brain injury. One day she was herself, the next she was someone else. My mother got a virus infection (herpes zoster, aka shingles) in her brain. It attacked the nerves in her brain and fundamentally changed who she is. Scares the crap out of me that the wife I go to sleep with could be a different person when we wake up because of a viral infection.

(the meaning of this statement of Mahaprabhu has been debated within our sampradaya.

2. Trumps attempting to define free speech is transparently an attempt to restrict speech by punishing people that do not advocate his views publicly. It a fact that the majority of American do not support Trump and his Policies and even more true in intellectual circles any legitamate speakers list is going to skew heavily liberal for this reason. This to me, seems like a pathetic attempt to punish the intellectual world for universally disagreeing with and ridiculing his terrible and pointless decisions. and because the idea of how this would even actually be determined or enforced is so ridiculously nebulous right now I doubt if this is even conceptually possible and am wondering if this is just another one of his pipe dreams.
