I sent him a card and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing on it. I wrote, "Dear Jim: I loved your card." Then I got a letter back from his mother and she said, "Jim loved your card so much he ate it."

Scientists have discovered that dandruff occurs when a yeast like fungus called malassezia goes wild on your scalp. The microscopic malassezia fungus, a normal inhabitant on a healthy human head, feeds on the fatty oils secreted by hair follicles in the scalp. But sometimes, for reasons that are as yet unclear, the fungus grows out of control, causing irritation that actually speeds up cell turnover on the scalp. As a result, the normal process of cell turnover, which usually takes a month, may take less than two weeks when out of control malassezia has irritated the scalp. So many dead cells are shed at the same time that, when they mix with the oil from the hair follicles, they tend to form greasy clumps big enough to be clearly visible to the naked eye. The oil also makes the clumps more likely to get stuck in your hair (and on your shoulders), rather than floating quickly away.

But since 1850s, the small territory has been a gargantuan, and legal, gambling table..

The fact that DB is proactively restructuring the loan shows that the loan was not one that would be seen as having the potential to leverage a president into divulging classified information. 
Pro players argue that poker isn even gambling, because it a game of skill, not chance _ a view supported by a federal judge ruling last year that threw out the conviction of a man charged with running an illegal poker business in the back room of a Staten Island warehouse. 
That said, say hello again to flibanserin: the little pink pill with the Food and Drug Administration's strictest "" warning, the strongest warning used in the labeling of prescription drugs or drug products by the FDA when there is reasonable evidence of a serious hazard associated with taking the drug. The drug is effective in just somewhere between 8 and 13 percent of women, and can cause fainting, dizziness and low blood pressure, effects which were found to be increased by alcohol and hormonal contraception. In fact, total abstinence from alcohol is required, because unlike Viagra for men, which is taken just before sex to enhance physical arousal, flibanserin (a failed antidepressant) has to be taken daily. The once daily dose acts like a sedative, so it's advised to take it at bedtime to reduce the risk of serious injury.

My husband and I love each other very much, and as I said, much has changed in 5 years, but this is definitely our thing. Every marriage has a "thing." It doesn mean, even if it a problem, that this can work. But I do think, as the transgressor, that you can make it better or worse.
As the River Boyne divides the dioceses of Armagh and Meath, Drogheda was founded as two separate towns, Drogheda in Meath (for which a charter was granted in 1194) and Drogheda in Oriel (or as County Louth was then known. In 1412 these two towns were united and Drogheda became a Corporate styled as County of the Town of Drogheda Drogheda continued as a County Borough until the setting up of County Councils, through the enactment of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which saw all of Drogheda, including a large area south of the Boyne, become part of an extended County Louth.

P hacking is a broad term that covers a variety of dubious statistical techniques. I recommend reading A Garden of Forking Paths. by Andrew Gelman, which delves into some of the more esoteric methods of "p hacking". You describe p hacking as testing multiple interactions without merit. This indeed is a type of p hacking, but this is only one of many ways to p hack. One example is arbitrarily removing data points to massage a p value. A second example would be performing multiple types of statistical tests on data, and picking the one that provides significance.

"The elective coroner in New York City represents a combination of power, obscurity and irresponsibility which has resulted in inefficiency and malfeasance in the administration of the office. With constant temptation and easy opportunity for favoritism and even extortion, with utter lack of supervision and control, and without the slightest preparation and training to create in the coroner mind a scientific and professional interest in the performance of his duties, the present system could not have been better devised intentionally to render improbable, if not impossible, the honest and efficient performance of the important public function entrusted to his office.. 
I remember all too well the Christmas at my folks house when my daughter was about 2 1/2. My normally VeryJustYes mother was doing the JustNo grandma thing of "oh, she fine, let her be, she can do whatever she wants." She wasn usually like that, and I don know what got into her that day. The problem was, what my kid wanted was to be a tiny terrorist. She was behaving atrociously, and my mother kept interjecting "Oh, she fine" when I would try to get her to behave. I finally had enough; I packed up my kid and left, in the middle of a big family holiday celebration.

If they write, at the beginning of their essay, of "director Alfred Hitchcock's seminal psychological horror movie from 1960," they will, totally unintentionally, have happened on a sentence strikingly similar to thousands of other film studies essays about Psycho, as well as probably a few hundred movie review websites, its IMDb and Wikipedia pages, and any number of other sources that default to familiar, slightly hackneyed writing when talking about this film..

Look, former Speaker Jim Wright was accused of murder when ran for re election early in his political career. And that was back in the "good ol days".

People blamed the unions and big corporations got everyone against them. Guess what happened when the unions were gone? The corporations left anyway.Big businesses are always going to push to cut costs further. There is no end to that drive. If there is no one to push back, then we are going to take capitalism to a place that is not supportive of society as a whole (it is already there in many places). 
Aspect. Meta threads are, of course, an exception.
While the agreement forestalled major fiscal disruption for the time being, it was a ramshackle and inadequate attempt to deal with the problems that it was ostensibly designed to solve. The culmination of a protracted, tragi comic, and embarrassing spectacle, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (to paraphrase Winston Churchill) was not the end, nor even the beginning of the end.

A typical level is 12% DHA and 18% EPA. The popular 'salmon' oils (which are not really salmon) are usually of the 12/18 type.Many oils on the market today are from questionable sources and some have high levels of heavy metals or other contaminants such as PCB's.Use fish oils which have been molecularly distilled, or are from impeccable sources with a reliable certificate of analysis.This basically rules out any oil, which is processed from fish caught in the Northern Hemisphere.Most fish oils are of the triglyceride form, which does not easily pass through the cell membranes.Some suppliers of fish oil claim that it does not matter that the EPA is higher than the DHA because the body will convert part of the EPA to DHA.This is TRUE but like the conversion of ALA to DHA the percentage of conversion is very low.This is due in part to the high consumption of Omega 6 in the typical Western diet.Enzymes needed for the conversion are in 'short supply' in the bodies of those people who have a reasonably high level of Omega 6 intake (via vegetable oils).This is because the enzymes needed are 'used up' in having to deal with the processing of Omega 6 oils.As a result, the conversion in most people is quite negligible which further supports ingesting the DHA directly.MOST fish oils are in the triglyceride forms. A triglyceride consists of 3 fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone. 
Yes my DH (dear husband) is gone a lot because of the hours he works, and even on his off days I usually have LO (little one) at work with me, so I still do about 95% of the work. He helps when we are both home, but that doesn't mean he can't do something for himself. 
The game board is another difference between bingo and Po Ke No. In bingo, the word 'bingo' is spelled out across the top of the board with five rows and five columns of numbers under the spelled out word. In Po Ke No, however, this is not the case. In Po Ke No, the board is covered completely with illustrations of cards that you would find in a standard deck of cards. The Po Ke No game board has five spaces vertical and five space horizontal, giving a grand total of 25 spaces.

Case in point for my most recent game: I decided to try out an adversary for the first time, so went with the suggested Brandenburg Prussia on level 1 as my first adversary. To add some randomness, I had my wife pick the two spirits based on their names alone. She picked Thunderspeaker and Lightning Swift Strike. An easy and a moderate spirit, with good mix of offense/control and offense/fear.
After a long day at work or play, we often find ourselves retreating into the comforts of our bathroom for a long, hot shower or soak in the tub. Physically and psychologically, treating yourself to a steaming hot bath or shower can help to ease aches and pains for both the body and mind. The idea of hydrotherapy is certainly nothing new. Ancient Greeks, Romans and Egyptians all recognized and made use of water's restorative properties. That idea caught on and has been used through the ages, from hot springs to cold plunges.

Smart booking by Gedo yet again, booking a scrub like Chase Owens over one of your most over babyfaces like Juice Robinson.

If someone says something you disagree with, then you should and are basically obligated to criticize it. However, there a difference between criticizing specific beliefs or things that people have said and smearing/dehumanizing an entire group of people as "far right" in the pages of The Guardian. Call it a boy who cried wolf situation. Tommy Robinson got banned from Facebook and financial services like PayPal, Mark Meechan got his BBC contract cancelled in a day for being a "hate criminal", etc., and thousands of UK citizens get arrested and thrown in jail for things they say online or in real life each year. If you want people to take you seriously when you criticize "far right" bigotry and hate speech in the future, then you also need to do a better job of criticizing bad behavior on your side and reforming the popular perception that you more similar to totalitarian Nazis than the far right is.

2. Position Play   In holdem poker, a person's place and position could help a person win thus being seated in a "late position" is a very huge advantage because one could see all the moves of your opponents before you do. A little observation and a keen eye would help a lot so if ever you are seated in the "late position" when playing holdem poker, better grab the opportunity..

Following his death, she preserved and promoted her late husband's legacy. Adams also refused proposed benefit shows for the family's massive debt, which, again, was mostly due to Ernie's refusal to pay income taxes.

Was only going to talk about in my future videos what GTO is and its comparison to GOATS and why GOATS exists in that context. Especially in the pro scene its zen GOATS vs zen GOATS on a lot of maps, so understanding that two players are trying to play perfect overwatch, the answer is to get the most value out of every cooldown possible, and how one misplayed cooldown can swing your probability of winning the fight out of your favour. Also a video explaining about using information, and how information is king to play exploitative. I was just going to create parallels between the games and obviously there is never going to be an exact science between comparing two drastically different games, and just create a more statistically minded approach to GOATS cooldown usage in high SR scrims/OD/Contenders games.

Splitting can turn an excellent hand into a terrible one, and vice versa. Here are some rules of thumb: Never split 5's   your total is 10; you are likely to end strong. Always split 8's and Aces. Splitting 8's will change probable losers to probable winners. Splitting Aces is advantageous, but understand this: You are only allowed to split Aces once (sometimes), and you can only take one card for each new hand (sometimes.) Some casinos did this because splitting Aces, without any restriction, is a great advantage.
Same with Skyrim for 2011 standards. 
This rule has created a number of terrible situations. Right now, there are third year students working as supervisors on multi million dollar grants earning literally thousands of dollars less than the data coders they supervise. There are students with poor work ethic and grades making 14% more than our program top performers. What worse, these discrepancies appear to be related to demographic variables (like sex, race, age), but since grad student aren "employees" ethical standards need not apply.
Sometimes outs aren't true outs. In certain situations, an out may be more beneficial to your opponent than you. A good example is when you're playing an open  straight draw but the flop produces 3 suited cards.

While in land based casinos, the only problem you face when it concerns your bankroll is, well, your lack of money. In virtual poker casino, the deposit limit of the online site really does affect the game you are playing. Even if you're always winning and even if you play aggressively, you can lose all your online bankroll money and you cannot play anymore because your deposit is gone (even if you have cash available).

Probably the toughest variety and the easiest to grow is 'Arp.' That's the one I use to create short rosemary "hedges" along dryish edges of the garden.

I think climate change makes it inevitable. Most of the country freshwater is, after all, quite famously concentrated in the Midwest, and the Northeast and Midwest as a whole are much more resistant to climatic (and otherwise) shocks than the South or Interior West are.

When ive listened to Louie, Dave, and Matt talk about their programming they have always focused on the ME work as that is what drives the strength for the comp lift and combining that with the targeted movements for weaknesses, like you mentioned. F =MA is tossed around so much by Louie, Matt, other proponents but they hardly ever use it correctly. Unlike real sports where force matters, or power if we are being exact, powerlifting doesnt have the same needs and so the time component is not a large factor.

Yes, I have seen the Jeffree Star video of his dilation. Until this thread blew up I believed myself largely alone in the world. EoE was pretty unknown when I was diagnosed, and to this day I only met one other person in the wild who had it. It kind of an embarrassing condition and it hard to explain, so it really not something I ever talked about much. So it was kind of cool to see someone recognizable make a video like that. EoE brothers and sisters unite!

We are to honestly express our emotions, but to do so out of love and trust.Forgiveness means not berating the other person, not bringing it up in arguments (especially as ammo), and not talking about it flagrantly without respect for the other person.

Turning point: Late in the first quarter, the Buffs trailed 14 7, but had just picked off an ASU pass. The offense couldn't capitalize, though, and punted. ASU blocked the punt and got the ball at the CU 11. Four plays later, the Sun Devils kicked a field goal, took a 17 7 lead and never looked back. It was another in a long line of Pac 12 blowout losses, and it extended CU's conference losing streak to 13 games.

I really don get people in the US. Why are so many people so aggressive? Why is fighting such a common thing, even among grown adults? Maybe I sound weak, but getting hit in the head just once and falling on a hard surface like concrete or a metal pole is enough to mentally disable you for the rest of your life especially if you an untrained fighter and don know how to hold your chin. Gang violence is one thing, but violence between non gangsters just never made sense to me and it so common in most parts of the US.

You should always assume the company employees can see all your stuff unless they explicitly say otherwise.

Agitation for a ban on "cow slaughter" is beisically religious, for the cow and the bull are the most sacred of animals to the Hindu.

Cooler. Just a note, I think I prefer a call on the turn vs this overbet. You going to have a lot of Qx and sets when you get to the turn.

Since when did freedom of speech become a battleground of defending the right to lie and be bigots? In the last century it was about being able to overcome bigotry and lies and now its to defend bigotry and lies? You know what the problem is with this country? We all a bunch of liars.

More tasty Adelaide fare. This time Australia pipped India by 38 runs in a terrific fourth Test. India needed an unlikely 372 to win, but with Mohammad Azharuddin's revolving door working overtime, they almost got there. At 283 for 6, with Azharuddin and Manoj Prabhakar well set, a shock was on. But Craig McDermott returned to break the partnership and whipped away the tail to take his second five for of the match. That wasn't the full story, though: 21 wickets fell on the first two days and then only one on the third, as a lively pitch flattened out into the definitive Adelaide shirtfront.

However, it can sometimes be difficult to determine the cause of allergic dermatitis. It could be caused by a parasitic infestation, such as ringworm, ticks or mites. Sunburn can cause dandruff. Your cat could be sensitive to stress, or allergic to a new food or grooming product. It could even be due to something as simple as the air being too dry indoors in the winter. If you feel like the air is dry in your home and your skin feels dry and tight as a result, you can bet your cat is experiencing the same thing. Humidifying will not only get rid of the dry skin problem, but it will also cut down on static electricity in your cat's coat and reduce the likelihood of winter colds. This is the easiest fix for dandruff problems in cats.
