One poster suggested that your brother may have Asperger or ADHD. I do not agree. Asperger falls along the Autistic spectrum. Yes, that would involve qualities like a lack of social awareness or interest in the thoughts or feelings of others that the brother exhibits. But it would also involve social isolationism. It involves the inability to make outward connections to others. I know 2 people with mild Asperger Syndrome. While socializing is difficult for them (they are introverts), they do socialize well and neither presents the upheavals your brother does.

So, you've taken great care of your skin throughout your life, using the right soaps and moisturizers to properly care for your face. But despite your best efforts, you can't fight the effects of aging and you find those inevitable wrinkles creeping in around your eyes and forehead. No matter how fastidious you are in your skin care regimen, the fact is that everybody ages, and with the ticking off of the years comes the degeneration of the skin. Fortunately, there are professional treatment options available if you're tired of obsessing about your crow's feet.

Making amends and taking responsibility doesn necessarily mean asking for a harsher punishment, as the LAOP suggested they wanted to do. I mean obviously it hard to judge with so little information and the LAOP could very well be correct that the victim will be happy about this turn of events, but some things the LAOP said made me worry they still thinking self centeredly about this situation rather than putting their victim needs first.

If you been paying attention, you know that they already made an excellent offer weeks ago in the form of the House passing bipartisan legislation that gives the Republican controlled Senate another chance to re vote on their own bill. Or, they would be able to do so if the Senate wasn unilaterally being prevented from voting on it by Mitch McConnell. Included in that bill is nearly $10 billion in additional border security funding that targeted at addressing the weaknesses that cartels/smugglers/traffickers are actually exploiting today, in addition to visa enforcement (since 50% of illegal immigrants enter the US on visas and stay once they expired), infrastructure, personnel, etc.

Since OP asked where could he improve, I gonna chime in since no one is answering, you all are mostly just circle jerking. 3 bet larger pre for value at these lower stakes. Most villains will call when dominated like this hand. Flop and turn play are great if we are playing online. Your mistake in this hand was not reading your opponent in this live setting. Take the time to learn how to do this. At many low stakes live games you can just tell when your opponent is rip roaring and ready to stack off. The tells are very subtle at first but once you train your brain to recognize them, you will be able to make incredible check backs and folds.
Its probably losing money when you 4bet bluff/shove these hands, because you are either flipping or absolutely destroyed by the top of their range. Try sticking to only flatting their 3bets with 22 99, its even fine to cold call a 3bet if you think the original raiser is unlikely to 4bet the 3bettor, in fact you will give the original raiser better pot odds to get into the hand which will in turn give you even better implied/pot odds to set mine. Sometimes the original raiser will 4bet but more often than not they will just flat as well.
There your plot. What Common Sense doesn tell you is that this kid (Josh), has sex at age 13 with a woman who is probably in her 30s. Even though Josh looks like an adult, he still has the maturity of a 13 year old, and the whole romance part of the plot struck me as twisted and innapropriate.

Novice players are also advised to try their hands on the low limit poker matches first. These games only accept very low 'bets' and is also good for those who need to practice while having the chance to earn cash (even if small) at the same time. This is a winning poker strategy that you should not pass up on as it gives you more practice, makes you compete with novice and 'mid range' players while avoiding the seasoned players, and still allows you to experience being a poker player who gets to win cash, unlike in the free games that let you bring home nothing..

I would love for a way for potential new members to click on a button to submit an application to join or request permission to join that would go to a separate type of modmail or something outside of the normal modmail queue. I also request they usually attach a picture verifying their admittance to practice law somewhere as part of the their application. For the past few years, I had them email that verification to a google email address so that it was kept outside of the normal modmail list, and I m able to delete those emails once they been processed. My ideal solution is a space where I can go through one at a time approving users to the subreddit quickly with one or two clicks, while at the same time deleting their admittance requests once they were approved. Usually people want any information tying their reddit profile back to their identity deleted as soon as possible.

Another important concept is having counterfeit protection. For example, let's look at two hands, one with A 2 3 5 and one with A 2 Q K. If the flop comes 4 6 7, both players have the best possible low hand. You might raise the bet here, thinking you have a good shot at the low hand. However, if an A or 2 falls on the turn or river, the hand with A 2 Q K no longer has the best possible low while the other hand still does. Remember, you have to use two cards from your starting hand. If you have to throw out your A or 2 because you made a pair on the turn or river (and consequently no longer have the lowest hand), you would have to play your K or Q (making your low hand very weak).

Now regarding Kate, I think the show has done a relatively good job at showing some of the difficulties related to being overweight.

I had a sudden, extreme allergic reaction this time last year and an allergy specialist prescribed low strength Dermaid for my eyes. I don't need to use it anymore but it definitely saved me in the early days! I had also tried rosehip oil (before seeing the specialist) and I agree it was calming, but it didn't really do anything for me in the long run.

But more importantly it kills the unfriendly oral bacteria exacerbating gum disease. I prescribe chlorhexidine for patients who have acute inflammation and generally for patients who have horrible oral hygiene.

I prescribe it long term for elderly patients who can't brush or floss because of crippling arthritis or because of mental decline and apathy.

Just saw a documentary about a baby born with two faces in a village in India. She was born at a healthy weight and was thriving. They were convinced she was the incarnation of one of their Gods (Vishnu, possibly). Her family would lay her out in the open and villagers would stop by and shower her with money. Her eyes became damaged from sun exposure. Her family refused to seek treatment for her even after being told she needed to be seen and admitted to hospital  she had a cleft pallet and because of this she wasn able to create enough suction to drink from her bottle so she was losing body weight very rapidly. She died 8 weeks later of a massive heart attack. If they just stopped with the bullshit, I almost positive this baby would have survived.

If you have trouble, you switch for a phrase and then try to explain it or ask for help explaining it. Sometimes big groups fracture, and in that instance it ok to speak in the most common language there, but if someone joins, you may want to switch back when you would normally say "we were just talking about X." What you should not do under any circumstance is proceed to speak in a language that someone does not understand (unless you share no languages) because that is just telling them that they are not welcome in the conversation.

My mom isn a native Arabic speaker but she learned it to a point that even her accent is native like and no one can even tell she not Arab. She did it purely by immersion. Her original language was east African so language family wise it wasn THAT far off but she did learn it all practically by immersion. However, just immersion isn enough. Once you go to an Arab country you need to practically live an Arab life. Make Arabs friends, get a job (even if part time) in Arabic, and consume Arab media only. I don know about other Arab countries but rising Gulf countries are very accepting to people who speak Arabic to an intermediate or below intermediate level so I would suggest going there. They have lots and lots of immigrants from non Arab countries and another giant group of Arab immigrants so you would be exposed to all dialects and not just one. There also community classes made to teach non natives Arabic if you are worried about having formal instruction. I wasn advanced by any means I was barely touching intermediate at the time. I used to look up any words that I wanted to say and couldn consistently and over time these words just stuck cause I was using them. I haven actively worked on vocab in a long time (my fault I lazy) but while writing recently I realized I needed the dictionary a lot less and I knew a lot of words that I never went out of my way to learn. That method helped reinforce the grammar that I learned and kept consistently learning while adding vocab in the mix.

These days there are all kinds of hydrotherapy treatments you can experience, and you don't need to travel to remote hot springs to get them. Hydrotherapy spa treatments have come a long way. Some treatments work in tandem, like steam baths followed by quick plunges in cold water. This process is repeated and is supposed to help with the body's internal balance. Underwater massage therapy is popular as well. For this process, you relax in a warm tub while water is applied with a hose at various pressures to sore muscles. You can also get a good old fashioned head, neck and scalp massage while soaking in a hot tub. This can be applied along with aromatherapy treatments for maximum relaxation.

In your data analysis, I see you describe two statistical pitfalls. First, you state that you exclude data points from your analysis not because they are measurement errors, but because they don fit your vision of what the model should look like. It almost a self fulfilling prophecy, in the sense that you are exaggerating the difference between your comparison groups to prove that the two groups are different.

Ubisoft games on Steam are little more than launchers to the uPlay install location. You can launch a Ubisoft game on Steam without uPlay, and DLCs/digital content purchased on Steam needs to be validated and activated for ownership before it can be accessed in game. Nowadays it improved enough where it can happen automatically but uPlay will provide a pop up essentially saying that a new DLC has been found through Steam and if you would like to activate it use. However that wasn the case back early on with the first Division and DLC ownership was having issues unlocking and verifying.

I think shortchanged himself ending his career two of three years too soon. It's kind of like how Joe Calzaghe retired too soon and baseball player Ty Cobb ended his career too soon. Cobb hit .323 in his final season in 1928. Froch should kept fighting. They would have had to drag me out of the ring if I was still successful and makes tons of good clean cash. Believe me; I sure as heck wouldn't end my career on a soft defense against Groves. I would want to end my career on a quality fighter like Groves.

I have been into fitness and health since childhood and swam competitively through junior high and high school. I became interested in fitness, and rehabilitation in particular, during chiropractic college when I was severely injured when struck by an automobile while changing a flat tire. I suffered multiple jaw and facial fractures and spinal injuries. I educated myself about sports nutrition and rehabilitation to aid in my recovery, and I now use this knowledge to help my patients recover from injuries and attain higher levels of health. Dr. I read a post about the guy who was sore or bruised after the massage. If you dont sore the next day or two, you didnt get a proper massage. Remember, they work with soft tissue, so it perfectly natural to feel sore. If I don feel sore, I feel jipped! After a couple of days, you feel better than ever. I have moved around over the years and tried different chiro offices and NONE compare to this office. They have a patient for life (as long as I stay in this area). Thank you Dr. Parker and staff!!

That said, I really don think the school is that liberal. In my experience as a poly sci/econ student, I would say it is pretty average. I mean, the polysci tends left, as do many of the programs, but its not exactly full of Marxists or anything. Similarly, the econ program, to me, seems balanced. No MMT here at least. And to the best of my knowledge, other programs (save for labor stuff) aren super left wing, and I don believe the law school has a particular slant.

I was so confused, and thought that perhaps he had only ever been sexually attracted to me, and had never really intended on having a real relationship with me. It was only after I started to worry about his personal safety that I begged him to just let me know he was ok.

Last month, signatures for Colorado ballot initiative No. 20 started up. If it goes to the voters and passes, the initiative would set into play an entirely new and more affordable co op health care model. The ColoradoCare initiative hinges on Sec. 1332 of the ACA, which, under the Wyden waivers, permits states to waive all coverage components of the ACA, including exchanges, benefits packages, and employer mandates in favor of innovating state run plans that, in our case, reduce costs and bureaucracy. This proposed comprehensive health care plan is akin to universal health care and could save residents $1.6 billion and businesses $1.3 billion all without deductibles. Yes we CAM, Colorado.

One of the things I learned from dating a med student, and just relationships in general, is to never expect anything without communicating. I think that asking for your SO to send a check in message during a super busy time might do more harm than good. Residents have a lot on their mind and a lot to worry about. The last thing they want is to stress about another "to do" item.My suggestion would be to wait for their workload to die down a bit and then raise the issue in a non accusatory way. Perhaps starting with the fact that you like hearing from them, even if they don have anything new to report other than working/studying. Bringing up that you appreciate a message or call because you miss them and want to know how they holding up is much better than asking for a check in. It seems less suspicious and more caring.This is absolute horse shit. However, the article is just a rant about how financial advisors aren obligated to recommend the best products for their clients. Well no shit! If you thought that branch employees have a fiduciary duty, you a sucker and a chump.The Ontario Securities Commission confirms that "adviser" is a legal term under securities law that describesa person or company that is registered to give advice about securities, whereas "advisor" is not.The OSC just uses a different spelling. It doesn mean that individuals with certain titles are legally bound to keep their clients best interests in mind when executing trades or giving advice. In reality, all bank employees are pushed to reach their targets. What more important to them: their job and ability to pay bills or whether you get to retire in 30yrs?

Some will say: yes, but that college student will earn on average a million dollars more in her lifetime than someone who doesn have a degree and therefore it "worth it." But that is, of course, a misrepresentation of what "average" means. Most college grads will not earn huge sums. Some (and probably mostly those who did not take out loans in the first place) will earn spectacular sums.

I don't think the problem is so much that it didn't make realistic sense, but that it somewhat undercut the tension of the scene (Bathos). Its a very marvel esque wink at the audience technique, which made the movie feel more similar to the movies being made now than the star wars movies that had come before which is a bit of a problem, since presumably the universe itself hasn't changed. That was kinda my problem with the movie JJ obviously loves star wars given that he made every effort to include all the aesthetic and surface level details of the OT (stormtroopers, a rebellion, ect), but the tone, direction, cinematography, writing, ect. often don't really feel like star wars but another 2010s era action/adventure movie in a star wars skin.

I didn't follow the "manosphere" until about a year ago. To be frank, I looked at a lot of the profiles that I would come across on Twitter, scan the bio/feed and my immediate thought on most of them was "fraud".

I also believe that a core problem with our music callings is that there no accountability, the way a Primary teacher is accountable to a Primary president, and a Relief Society president is accountable to a bishop.

He then made sure that his parents, who were with him, didn't know anything about it, probably using the old "Hey, look over there, and continue to do so while ignoring the grotesque sounds and spray of blood coming from this general direction."

Does it accomplish X in the same mechanical manner? (for example, my drill+gatling gun, one button push, multiple rounds) or does it just kinda simulate X, in a different manner (bump stock). One important difference is that a bumpstock requires two hands worth of manipulation as you pull the gun forward and the recoil backwards creates the bump firing.
Also encourage people to see the value of ALLIANCES with other players, in order to meet objectives (trading to meet a spend trade goods objective for example, or trading cease fires and concluding a mutual defense pact, etc.) If the galaxy splits into 2 or 3 warring camps, players may be less anxious to attack since it is less "personal."People being too anxious to lose ships and resources to war.

Laws were passed (in fact, most states only got sex offender registries in the 1990s after the federal government threatened loss of funding if they weren established), TV shows and movies were made, educational programs were invented. The result was panic. Panic in Congress and state legislatures as everything from sex between teens to naked photos of one children were criminalized. Panic in schools as children were taught that they should worry about abduction all the time. Panic in the homes as parents chose "safety" over "health" and "well being."

My buddy Matt once got into a 50 hour long heads up (one on one) match with another pro. Well, the other guy took Matt for over $70,000, at which point Matt decided to take a break from poker for a few months. When I commiserated and pointed out that taking a break was probably a good idea after such a big loss, Matt replied that it wasn't about the money. He didn't give a shit that he lost $70K. What he cared about was that he got outplayed for 50 hours straight. And that's why he was taking a break. Because, due to variance, what matters in the long run is how well you play, not how much you win or lose in any given session.
