When Lyndon Johnson found out that his Chief of Staff Walter Jenkins had been caught having sex with another man at the YMCA bathroom down the street from the White House, he knew his longtime friend and comrade had to go. As Lee Edelman points out in an essay about the Jenkins affair, "Tearooms and Sympathy: An Epistemology of the Water Closet," having gay sex meant certain death for a political career because having gay sex meant vulnerability and breached borders and that the Soviets would invade any minute. This was all the more true since Jenkins was the receptive partner in the exchange and his lover was "foreign born."

Yet another possible explanation for the word poker, is that it came from a version of an underworld slang word, "poke," a term used by pickpockets. Cardsharps who used the 20 card cheating game to relieve a sucker from his poke may have used that word among themselves, adding an r to make it "poker." The thought was that if the sharps used the word "poker" in front of their victims, those wise to the underworld slang would not surmise the change. Why did he call it Poker? Researchers looked into games of other countries to see if there was any game whose name sounded anything like "poker." They came up with an eighteenth century French game called poque , a German game that involves a certain amount of bluffing called Pochspiel , and there's even a suggestion that the word derived from a Hindu word: pukka .

I felt like this was muddled storytelling. Seemed like it was going to build up to her being implicated in something and that that would add some tension/urgency/make everyone not believe her as she was figuring out the crime. But I guess it was just about her being."a drunk and a slut"? It was weird that "dangerous" was used more than once to describe her if that all it was, I thought. That and Vickery paying Jackie a house call just to ask questions about her.

Now i realize there is a leap of logic in there that might easily be overcome by a massage therapist saying something absurd about causality that increases anxiety like, wow that seems like a ruptured disc, when really the person has some ibs or fm and should be getting a relaxing tummy rub or head massage or something, without any business oriented assertions regarding why the patient ought to be getting massage.

All I can do is speculate, as I am not on the inside with the scouts.

As I've said before, people love to run with myths, and sadly, this one is self sustaining: The misinformation brings a lot of vitriol, the vitriol prompts removals, and the removals result in more misinformation.

While at the same time, comments beginning with "I've heard." or "I've seen." get upvoted, read, and repeated by people who don't actually know anything about the situation..

Oh my god, that is such a familiar story, it so sad. At least the dad and son have you in their corner! It better to have someone invested than to just have the state deal with it. As for group homes, it always very specific to what available in home versus how good your local group homes are. There a lot of support avaliable for in home care because the state is moving away from residential (partially money and partially because of all the scandals like willowbrook) but someone with needs like his can be very stressful even in a good home with caretakers who are willing and prepared. But some group homes are amazing! Look into your local agencies, the ones who are invested in independence and growth for their clients are going to have good residential care.

We have a specific agency for people disabilities, but it might have a different name in different states.

Obviously this is just an estimate and doesn account at all for the inevitable increase in demand for soybean milk (now that we eliminated livestock), soybean oil, nor other soybean industry production needs. This is purely a discussion on the protein needs the planet would have if it depended on soy instead of meat and, as stated before, even more plant based protein would have to be consumed to make sure the population gets all 9 amino acids (a complete protein diet). Yet this estimate still gives one an idea of how much industrial agriculture would need to increase to accommodate just the protein needs of the planet. 
Rich got even richer in 2009, the rest of us are worse off than ever, but the idea that there might be a possibility of uniting around our common class interests and taking our country back from the robber barons who have been running it seems so completely disconnected from reality that I want to travel back in time two years and throw a bucket of ice water into my stupidly optimistic faceIf I had been shocked into reality with a faceful of water, perhaps I would have predicted the success with which white resentment would be mobilized in groups like the Tea Party. Righteous anger of the white masses is not at the bankers and politicians who put us in this mess, but at Mexican immigrants.

They may never be as magical as things feel from back then, but maybe they shouldn't be anyway.

Canonically, Voyager I was never discovered by aliens. The colonists of Gliese 445 claim to have recovered the probe en route and had it one display in one of their orbital habitats for generations and broadcast the full recording on the plate to numerous neighboring colonies. However, there were reasons to doubt these claims. The colony ship to Gliese 445 traveled at about .05c, much faster than Voyager I, and consequently had to take a different trajectory to reach the star, making interception of the probe unlikely even by the colony ship harvesting drone. The probe on display and the recording broadcast were likely a clever hoax. In any case, the habitat housing the alleged Voyager I was later destroyed in a war so it all a moot point.

Adolf Hitler was determined to wage war, it was no more inevitable that his 1939 invasion of Poland precipitated global conflict than that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria did so in 1914. Britain and France lacked both the will and the means to take effective action towards fulfilment of security guarantees they had given earlier to the Poles. The declarations of war on Germany were gestures which even some staunch anti Nazis thought foolish, because futile.

It not unusual to have a middle man. I used quite a few of those services when I was an IT consultant spending a few months in a city. It easier for companies renting apartments to have a corporate contract partner, as they usually provide monthly bills and rebates if you rent multiple apartments at once. For the landlords it easier to have one long term renter (the middle man) which does all the administrative work. my Lord, he says.

So in sum, the British Celtic language imparted so few loanwords into English because 1) linguistic contact often changes syntax morphology, not vocabulary 2) Celtic languages influenced English on two occasions: a phonological influence imparted by a hypothetical Lowland British Celtic language which can be discerned in Old Irish, its closest surviving relative. 
That is beyond absurd.

In essence, the Coca Cola Polar Bears have become icons that seem to be able to carry the name and push the product without being intimidating and will actually appeal to a consumer base of all ages. The bears are an international symbol and work very well, as they are able to transcend all languages because they do not say anything but simply make bear noises. Here they are all appealing and work very well as a masterful marketing tool for every product in every facet of the Coke line.

(Besides, there wasn't just one server, but 140.)An advanced investigation of an advanced hacking operation requires significantly more than just access to servers. Investigators want access to the attack infrastructure the equivalent to a chain of getaway cars of a team of burglars. And the latest indictments are rich with details that likely come from intercepting command and control boxes (in effect, bugging those getaway cars) and have nothing to do with physical access to the DNC's servers.The FBI and Robert Mueller's investigators discovered when and how specific Russian military officers logged into a control panel on a leased machine in Arizona.

You can learn the syntax to make queries pretty quickly, the trick is when you need to "join" information from multiple tables. If you make a mistake, you won always get an error message, sometimes you will get nonsense, or just nothing at all. Companies use programs like Crystal Reports or Microsoft Access to format reports based on these queries, and you can be employed to make these reports for management.

The average pair of feet takes an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 steps each day and travels up to 80,000 miles in a lifetime, according to the American College of Foot Ankle Orthopedics Medicine. Walking puts the pressure of about one and a half times your body weight on your foot; running increases this pressure to about three or four times your weight. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), your feet absorb up to one million pounds of pressure during a strenuous, hour long workout!
I 10 years older than you. Believe me, when I say that I wasn born this way.

Once named among the 10 Homes that Changed America by PBS, Lyndhurst is just one of several luxury mansions that reside along the Hudson River in Upstate New York. Designed by Alexander Jackson Davis and completed in 1838, Lyndhurst is easily among the finest examples of Gothic Revival homes in the country, and over the years has been the home to former New York City mayor William Paulding, businessman George Merchant and railroad developer Jay Gould. The entire property occupies 67 acres and several of the mansion rooms may be viewed as part of a Classic Mansion Tour, from April through September, in addition to holiday tours from October through December, in addition to specialty tours that are held on select weekends from May through September.

Foreplay is huge, clitoral stimulation is important, and not surprisingly, women report more orgasms when a vibrator is in the mix. In fact, women are far less likely than men to care (or perhaps even notice) how long intercourse lasts. Of couples surveyed in a 2003 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, 24 percent of men claimed they had a PE problem   but only 10 percent of their partners agreed.

Ask yourself what does Villain have that calls pre. Probably a ton given he was on the BTN and was getting a great price in position. Very wide. Can't really narrow it. Now, ask yourself what he can call a King high dry board with. KX combos (Tons of them), pocket pairs including sets and JJ, maybe something like 67s or QTs with a backdoor. Now, when you check the turn, which of those hands can bet to protect themselves from draws and/or extract value?

Our daughter also mentioned a book the teacher read aloud, "Uncle Bobby's Wedding," about two male "gay" guinea pigs, promoted by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Transgender Lobby for children. Since homosexual activists cannot reproduce their own children, recruitment to their cause (especially at a young age, before parents have raised such sensitive and controversial topics with their children) is essential to the political agenda of promoting homosexuality and "gay" marriage..

I want to end this by saying I do not have a college education. I've worked in retail my entire life and more recently in the legal cannabis industry. I got tired of the uncertainty of retail and decided it was time to make a change. If, all things being equal, I can make the jump from the pot industry to banking, I'm sure others can make similar jumps. It's easy to get caught up in the notion that you're stuck in a field or job, you're not. Take the leap of faith!

Aluminum building wiring is a type of electrical wiring for residential construction or houses that uses aluminum electrical conductors. Aluminum provides a better conductivity to weight ratio than copper, and therefore is also used for wiring power grids, including overhead power transmission lines and local power distribution lines, as well as for power wiring of some airplanes.[1][2] Utility companies have used aluminum wire for electrical transmission in power grids since around the late 1800s to the early 1900s. It has cost and weight advantages over copper wires. Aluminum wire in power transmission and distribution applications is still the preferred material today.[3]

Results: There was a significant decrease in average symptom severity (SSI) by 4 months which continued for 22 months, and significant improvement in symptom frequency (SFQ), Quality of Life (QoL) and voiding symptoms (I PSS) at time of final followup (22 months). There was no significant change in sexual function (SFI). 56% had >60% decrease (significant improvement) in symptom severity (SSI) while 47% had similar significant improvement in frequency of symptoms (SFQ). 42% reported marked subjective improvement (SGA) by the end of the study period. The presence of uropathogens, presumed non pathogens or sterile cultures; average induction WBC EPS count (6.6/HPF), zenith count (31/HPF) or final nadir count (9.6/HPF)) were not predictive for favourable response.

InSight HP3 deploys about one week after the seismometer is in place. InSight arm will place the heat probe on the ground, and it will begin to slowly burrow down from its location. The mole at the end of the probe slowly burrows into the ground like a self hammering nail. It hammers down for up to four hours at a time; each four hour period is known as one "hammering cycle." As it descends, it stops roughly every 19.5 inches (50 centimeters) to generate a pulse of heat. The probe watches how this pulse of heat travels through the subsurface material around it. It monitors how quickly or slowly the mole heats up the surrounding soil; this is known as measuring the "thermal conductivity" of the soil.

Lottery draws are random, so it doesn matter what other people do, right? Wrong. Although psychology can rule the fall of the balls it can determine the size of your windfall. Thanks to our superstitions and customs, certain numbers tend to be more popular choices than others meaning that if they come up, the jackpot is shared among more people. On a standard lottery game where you have to choose 6 numbers between 1 and 49, Poundstone says any of the following numbers will give you a better shot at the full jackpot: 10, 20, 29, 30, 32, 38 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, 49.

Those relatives died fighting for slavery. You don't see descendants of Nazis honouring their dead relatives by waving around swastikas.

For Canada, the Bank was projecting a temporary slowdown in late 2018 and early 2019, mainly because of last year drop in oil prices. The Bank had forecast weak exports and investment in the energy sector and a decline in household spending in oil producing provinces. However, the slowdown in the fourth quarter was sharper and more broadly based. Consumer spending and the housing market were soft, despite strong growth in employment and labour income. Both exports and business investment also fell short of expectations. After growing at a pace of 1.8 per cent in 2018, it now appears that the economy will be weaker in the first half of 2019 than the Bank projected in January.
