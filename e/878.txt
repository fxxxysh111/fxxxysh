Liddy, actually said, apparently with a straight face, that these bonuses were necessary to keep the "best and the brightest." Now call me naive, but exactly where are the best and brightest going to go in this economy for a better job? And aren these the best and the brightest that brought the economy down in the first place with their trades in debt and human misery? And aren these the same executives who now earn several hundred times what an average worker earns when in 1979 that number was 29 times?.

The other day I was listening to a BBC story about how the US offers no maternity leave. There was a note of shock and dismay in the female reporter voice as she interviewed American women about how they dealt with maternity leaves that were either unpaid or too short or nonexistent. She could not believe that an industrialized nation had such barbaric policies toward women. Then a soldier emailed the program to talk about the "excellent" maternity (and even paternity) leaves allowed by the US military. It was as if waging war was suddenly a feminist undertaking.

Did you ever think that you could be frozen into better health? While you might think that exposing your body extreme temperatures of any kind is a recipe for disaster, placing yourself in freezing conditions actually may improve your overall fitness and well being. Cryotherapy, a rather unusual treatment that is sweeping the spa world, exposes spa goers to subzero temperatures in an effort to relieve pain and improve health. Gone are the days of putting a bag of frozen peas or an icepack on a sore joint; cryotherapy is the next new thing.

20.01% to 36.9%   Average: These players are the most dangerous in that they may have tendencies of being solid and weak, many of them in poker learning stages that may well be improving.

That would of course be an odd thing to do, given that Republicans, who had a 100 year history of opposition to slavery, support for the civil rights of black Americans, efforts to pass anti lynching bills, opposition to Jim Crow laws   efforts to disband the Ku Klux Klan. The GOP even voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act with much larger majorities than Democratics. Why would racists and segregationist Democratics now become Republicans?

Man I wish I was white and rich and had a white republican appointed entitled piece of shit judge sentence me. I mean even though Paul Manafort probably didnt collude or do anything treasonous, he did indeed facilitate it. He enabled a foreign adversary the ability to covertly and psychologically influence our election, which probably lead us to what will probably be remembered as the gilded age of the new millennium. Plus he didn't pay taxes. So all in all I can see how 4 years instead of 19 is fair. Especially when he was convicted of just 8/18 charges (10/18 of which he did eventually admit of being guilty to but wasn't charged w because of 1 dumb fuck trump groupie who lacks the basic skills to realize trump and those around him are rich, white, republican, entitled, sleaze playing normal people off their differences and insecurities). the man is blameless I tell you! Just ask all the witnesses he tampered with and his blatant cover ups and lies!

Yes, this has essentially become a zombie thriller now, as the Cranks chase the kids even more relentlessly than Janson and WCKD do. The problem is that everything about this film feels familiar, from crowds of The Walking Dead to The Day After Tomorrow's abandoned shopping mall to Transformers 3's tilting skyscraper. As with the first film, the dialogue overflows with corny mythology in which everything given an ominous, cool sounding name. It's all so constructed that it sounds utterly artificial. And the derivative action sequences are directed without even a hint of realism.

When you've had the chance to sit down with Christina and spend some time listening to her   you realize that her weaving of multiple industries together in a joint effort to cross expose   to cross market   is an innovation of its time. She's successful and the question is really when the others will catch up. Her intellect continues to stir new waves   a force of nature that no one in boxing has ever seen before. Joining forces with Kaliesha, some say that these two may very well be the most multi dimensional boxers the sport has ever seen. Reaching new levels and breaking through the glass walls, it is Christina's determination and willingness to put it all on the line that makes every effort a committed one. She can sum it up in three words, "I'm all in."

So why does dopamine have such a scandalous reputation?

But that's only one of the numerous functions that dopamine performs in our bodies. It's also vital for important processes such as motor control, learning and memory.

So, hiccups are the result of diaphragm spasms. But what causes the irritation that leads to the spasm? There are only a few culprits for common hiccups, which usually disappear within a few minutes. One of the main irritants is a full stomach   a result of swallowing too much food or air. A distended stomach pushes against the phrenic nerves of the diaphragm, increasing the possibility of irritation and, therefore, hiccups. A full stomach of spicy food can do double damage   hot foods can be especially irritating to those nerves. As any smoker on a bender can tell you, excess smoking and drinking alcohol can also cause hiccups. A rapid temperature change outside or inside your stomach, from a cold night or a hot beverage, can be irritating enough to induce hiccups. Finally, emotions   shock, excitement and stress   can also trigger a hiccup fit.

The poles are relatively easy to establish: the literal camp would have believed in the gods. These stories make claims to be inspired by the muses, who witnessed the events and ostensibly use the bards as mouthpieces. The word "mmemnonai" is a storytelling word which means "I remember" but really "I remember exactly." (My Ancient Greek is weak, so please pardon my lack of a Greek keyboard, and my almost certain misspelling of the transliteration.) So for uncritical readers or devoutly religious ones, they probably would have understood it as literal.

A simple example: REMEMBERING GTO is an unexploitable strategy, so it cannot be beaten. And it is not specific to poker. Let say in this battle of the 2 year olds, Gary plays GTO strategy and Nick plays a GTO strategy. In this game, it is the same as No limit Holdem, only, you can only check or fold post flop, and both players post 1 big blind pre flop, and can only check their option preflop. Gary checks pre flop every time, and checks every time on the flop, turn and river. Nick does the same, only he forgets to check, and thus folds, on the flop, turn or river 5% of the time. That means, 5% of the time, Gary, with his GTO strategy, wins 1BB. That a win rate of 5BB/100 (not bad). Notice if Nick now never forgets to check, then both players break even, as they will always check pre flop, and always check on the flop turn or river. This is Nash equilibrium in effect, as now neither Gary or Nick can change their strategy to benefit themselves. Their stuck at breakeven, like every degen claims they are.

Supt. Taverner pulled himself from the OPP commissioner position on Wednesday, during what has become a political spectacle and amid a review of the selection process by Ontario's integrity commissioner.

Saying "yes" to everyone in every situation is not an option.

The first of these propositions is a version of an argument that is heard often on the Left and occasionally on the Right, too: that the West must not its own system of values the ideals of democratic government and personal freedom on other societies.

In order to be a full time player you have to know you can sustain a lifestyle at it. If you're uncertain you're not there yet. I was playing full time between Oct Jan for the first time in my life recently while I was in between jobs playing 100/200NL online. I averaged about 5 6k net a month which is higher than my full time job. I still decided to start my job anyway because I think it's more valuable to grind on the side, grow my bankroll, and move up stakes before going full time. I will evaluate again if I move up to 500NL 1kNL and see if that's the lifestyle I want. In your case I would grind on the side and improve until you're a winning 2/5 5/T player, have a large sample size that verifies you're a winner. (I had 250k hands before I did). You'll feel better prepared and have a higher income
SCORING RACE: It shaping up to be the best duel since Erie Dylan Strome and London Mitch Marner points joust during the 2014 15 season when the current Blackhawk outlasted the Maple Leafs star with a six point explosion on the final day. They ended up going third and fourth overall in the NHL draft that summer. This time, the leaders already are property of big league clubs. Sault Ste. Marie Morgan Frost (Flyers) was the first OHLer to reach 100 points and he in the driver seat, but Niagara Jason Robertson (Stars) is pushing him. Both clubs have the ability to put up 10 goals at any time against weak defensive play. London Kevin Hancock and Ottawa Tye Felhaber, both overagers, could win it, too, but they probably need a giant five  or six point game at some point here to get over the top.

Biggest concern is total $ comp. New gig $80k + 10% bonus so $88K, current is now $65K after this mornings raise, with a bonus equal to 1% of gross fees brought in by the team (on pace for $1.5 2M in fees so $15 20K in bonus). So there is a small disparity ($3 8K) between the two. Personally I value flexibility   and being able to work remotely (even just a few days a week) better provides me work life balance and autonomy. Also, since the total comp is comparable, I prefer the higher base pay (in my experience even with regular bonuses, it still not guaranteed and taxed at a higher rate).
