This guy doesn even know that women have 12 periods a year unless they get pregnant or don have them monthly for a health reason. Even if he was right about needing 10 tampons for your period, which is why wrong since they have to be changed every 4 8 hours so that at least 3 6 tampons a day, AT LEAST, he would be wrong about how many are needed. At the very least, this is if the girl is one of the lucky ones with a 3 day long period and she only has to change it 3 times a day since that the least amount of times that you can change it, that nine per cycle and that the lowest it can be. More likely, girls will change it at least 6 times a day and let say it 5 7 days, since that the average. On average a girl would use 30 42 tampons, at least, during a cycle. Then every month so that is 360 504 per year. And depending on the girl, it could be more or it could be less. Point is, this guy doesn know shit about girls or periods, even though if he just looked up three questions: How long do periods last? How often do girls have periods? How often do tampons have to be changed?, he would have gotten the same results that I just did.

The tolls would help for sanitation facilities, trail maintenance, conservation, bridges, additional bussing, etc.

The problem is that only about half the population wanted Brexit, and no one HAD any idea what that would look like in a practical sense.

Not 100% positive, but vanguard reallocates the fund distribution relative to the "retirement" date (read:2055) not really trying to time the market (so what you said in the first part of the second sentence).

Limit Poker bankroll. The most common number used for limit poker is 300 big bets. Determine what stakes you need to play to make the amount of money you are aiming for. Once that is done, anticipate an earn rate of one big bet an hour. Then, multiply the big bet times 300. If you are playing $10 $20, with a big bet of $40, it would result in an earn rate of (at 40 hours per week) $1,600, and you would need a bankroll of $12,000.

If your opponent sets up to outflank you to your left, then on turn 1 drop down to speed zero on the left flank, and turn up to speed 2 on the right flank. Then on turn 2 turn the engine back on so that you have some defenses ready when you start taking fire on turn 2 (or 3)..

And those other people are not, of course, as fully human as "people like us." And so debating whether homosexuals should be executed becomes "good journalism." If the journalists at the BBC had stopped for a moment and asked "If I were queer, would I ask this question? How would it feel to be queer and know that if I lived in Uganda I could be killed for loving someone else?" then they know that killing people for the gender of the people they love is no different than killing people for the color of their skin or their religion.

So, while fans may be suffering through short/split seasons now, the disappointing scenario could potentially pay off in the form of a spinoff (maybe). "If you're a creator on a show, having one of these split seasons, or having two final seasons gives you a point to aim for, narratively," Fienberg says. "It lets you know where you're headed, and how many episodes you have to get there and often gives you a break in the middle for writing or just for preparing for the scale of the closing episodes. Sometimes that results in the first seasons in these runs being more about staging so that the pieces are in place for a big climax, as happened with the two halves of the 'Breaking Bad' final season."

The wrong part is obvious: the government trying to control advertising could not possibly be a good idea. If ice cream is made to look creamier, does that count? Are we just talking bodies?

It really depends on your plan and the fees you seeing. If you saw an out of network specialist (for anesthesia, for example) then you be responsible for that portion of the bill. If you saw an in network provider, but they are billing for some code that your insurance doesn cover, then you be responsible for that amount as well. You also responsible for the coinsurance and any deductible you have to meet prior to your insurance covering anything. The best thing you can do is line up what the EOB says is your responsibility and then compare that with the bill from the provider. if the provider says you owe $2,000 but the EOB from insurance says you owe $1,000 is ask for an explanation from the provider. Sometimes they will say, "Whoops, our bad, should have been $1,000." Other times they will tell you to get bent. It a fucked up system.
If the anesthetic has high blood solubility, then you can dissolve a LOT of anesthetic in the blood before it becomes "saturated" and starts redistributing to the brain and fatty tissues. If the anesthetic has low blood solubility, then it rapidly saturates the blood and redistributes to brain/fat. FAST INDUCTION), you want one that has low blood solubility since it starts spilling over into your brain faster.Next, let talk about lipid solubility.

If your buddy asked you how many "regs" are in the game and you sitting with 7 whales that play regularly, you not in the game with 7 other "regs."

It's possible that in this future, privacy becomes obsolete. As we move to a mobile, social and pervasive Internet, we may see our private information become part of the public record. What if you could use that same pair of glasses and Internet connection to look up information about someone standing near you? Imagine meeting someone you'd like to date.

Sounds like a match made in heaven. I know people like to pretend they have a Jesus complex and strive to help every downtrodden soul they encounter, but the reality of life is that shitty people often gravitate towards each other and it brings harmony and fairness to the world. 
You don statements like "should have been able to do more." come from a place of ignorance. 
For whatever reason CW decided that's not what he wanted and it would be much better to just "rid of them". 
En 1893, Aigues Mortes connat un des plus grands massacres de l'migration italienne. Comme chaque anne, un nombre considrable d'ouvriers arrivent des Cvennes et d'Ardche pour faire la saison du sel. Nombreux sont les repris de justice et vagabonds qui se rendent  Aigues Mortes, plus pour se livrer  des vols et  des mauvais coups que pour y trouver de l'embauche.

Yes, and it's really annoying when people conflate the two. Not that SOME cases of lactose intolerance can't be quite severe, but those are comparatively rare. Most people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate trace amounts of lactose just fine, and many people just find that things like milk and cream are problematic, but small amounts of yogurt and most cheeses (where the lactose has been broken down by the culturing or cheese making process) are no issue.
Once Chahal completed his quota, Dhoni lined up Negi and drilled him for two more sixes, including one that hit the glass of the press box. He opened up his hips, generated power with his bottom hand, and nailed it over the sightscreen. All of that done with a stable base. Earlier in the night, AB de Villiers had provided a masterclass with a variety of sweeps and scoops. Dhoni doesn't do sweeps and scoops. His thing is to power the ball in the arc between midwicket and long off. A stable base and a smooth swing has helped him rediscover the power.
I recently graduated college so I have a decent amount of debt. 
That how I feel about Halo. The best formula for the franchise was found with Halo 2 and more refined for Halo 3. Reach was a good game but it added unnecessary elements to the game, changing core aspects of game play. this is when Halo started going down hill.

I'm sorry that you think that. Girl Scouts really had a huge impact on my life. As a city kid whose parents didn't have a lot of money, I earned money from selling cookies to travel to places my parents couldn't take me. Cookie profit also goes to upkeep of the camps and for running programs all over Southeastern PA for the scouts. Yeah, I get that cookies are pricey and unless you get mints or shortbread there aren't many in a box, but it really goes to a good cause.

In the same manner as number 5, be aware that there may be players out there who have small poker cash that would try to shoo away other poker gamers by getting those small pots or by nabbing blinds. These players will try to increase their chips so do not let that happen.. 
Imagine playing poker with a group of friends, you may trust your friends outside of the game, but during the game every player assumes that the other players are going to bluff, essentially implying that in a game of poker there is no trust among the players. Poker, like any other game, has defined a set of rules, an objective, and rounds.

A handful of players have shown glimpses of their full potential while still leaving some room to wonder about their ultimate roles this year. Outfielder Michael Saunders, an All Star in 2016 with Toronto, has been inconsistent as the veteran aims to prove his .158 average in 38 games at the Triple A level last season was a fluke. Fellow outfielder Noel Cuevas, who is attempting to make the 25 man roster as a reserve outfielder after making his MLB debut last season, could potentially start the season in Triple A Albuquerque.

A 10 yard pass to Aggie along the sideline where he is forced OB to stop the clock. Collingsworth even mentioned how big that force out was with 2:37 left. Its first down and that where the final series picked up which I covered above. I think a run or a pass in bounds could have been called there but yea I get that maybe that all the Pats defense was giving up on that particular play.

The reason I (dubiously) claim that most fall between those two poles but more certainly claim that some did has a lot to do with my understanding of the plurality of audience. So many listeners, in so many places, over so many hundreds of years. Even the devout would have doubted their certainty at times. And even the sophisticated would have been curious as to what elements rang true. A young child hearing the stories for the first time would have thought about them differently than an old man listening for his last time. A person who just lost a loved one in battle and someone who just killed a person would see them differently. I imagine something of a shifting bell curve of believability, with the peak(s) in different places depending on the particular audience. But one thing is certain: we lack sources that would have polled various groups on their perspectives on such a topic. Thus, we are left to conjecture.
China has been increasingly aggressive against North Korea over the last couple of years in an attempt to reign in their posturing and dangerous threats.
