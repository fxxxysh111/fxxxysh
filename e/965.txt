Then there the same drop pod you can find, the same two trailers with the broken machinery outside, the same crashed freighter with the same cargo pods in the same spots, the same building with the same alien in the same spot offering the same multi tool next to the same table with the same nav data on it with the same plant next to it on every planet, in every system, in every galaxy.
The problem with your proposed system is that there are too many "non calls" in essence   players getting questions wrong   for you to be able to stop the game enough and check on all of the wrong answers. If Will didn challenge his butane response at the time, it stands, so players can be confident in their score at any time.

We drink more and sometimes do it in public, pretending it legal, while cops pretend not to see.We drive chaotically, making U turns instead of right turns on reds. We are far from puritanical when it comes to behaviour.As well, according to Cracking the Quebec Code by pollster Jean Marc L one of Quebec distinct traits is that we are non committal, indecisive and averse to strong positions and all I can say to that is uh maybe it true.So it unsurprising most Quebecers think Trudeau and company may have stepped several centimetres over the line in talking to Wilson Raybould, yet also think that a minor political offence, not a hanging one.Similarly, while major columnists in Ontario say Trudeau and his staff recent explanations are flimsy, or crock, while Wilson Raybould is the only truth teller, most columnists here say it possible both sides believe their own version.If you ever been married er, sorry, Quebecers, lived common law you know you can have the same conversation and remember things very differently.Wait a minute, that not what I said last month, that what YOU said!Hah! That exactly what you always say when I say that what you said.I never thought Trudeau was the Golden Boy much of Canada and the world did when it came to transparency and revolutionizing politics, so I not angry or hurt to see he just a politician.Similarly, I believe Wilson Raybould is a highly capable, honourable person who quit a powerful job out of principle.

NOf course, this probability changes as the game progresses: it decreases when any of the tens, jacks, queens, kings, or aces get discarded, but increases when other cards get discarded. This change is unpredictable, but its expected value is 0; this is a complicated concept to explain, but it means that on average, the probability will go up as much as it goes down.

A few years ago some investment bankers called me to ask for my "expert" opinion on investing in the cosmetic surgery industry. I am an "expert" by virtue of writing a book on cosmetic surgery and, more importantly, having been quoted as an expert in the New York Times. I told them, I thought rather wisely, to forget about it. I told them that the entire industry was predicated on high interest medical loans and would collapse under the weight of its own greed. I thought I was incredibly prescient. Turns out I was just wrong, or at least wrong about one of the possible investments: Botox.

With that said, I do think we need a bit of a cultural movement in terms of understanding of pedophilia.

Served him right for being late! He always insisted the choir did it on purpose to insult him, as if he was of that much importance. But that family always thought they were much bigger potatoes than they really were. His brother Eliphalet imagined the devil was always at his elbow but I never believed the devil wasted that much time on him."

2. I read posts about advance rent and all the hypothetical nightmares and I don't agree. Of course, anything is possible, but these type comments remind me of all the naysayers to REI and the broken toilets, late night calls etc. People have any number of reasons to pay advance rent.

I footed the bills, buying all food, his cigarettes, his beer etc. I kept track of just the money for bills. He ended up cashing out a retirement fund he'd had after over a year of me supporting him.

With two feet of snow on the ground. The first of the month rolls around and I ask him for rent money. He says "but I just gave you $XX two weeks ago!" He had spent the entire retirement fund in that two weeks.

After the cards are exchanged, determine the winner of the game. Which five card draw poker hand beats which? Review the list below, from best hand to worst:The royal flush is the best. It contains an ace, king, queen, jack and 10. This is similar to the royal flush, except the 5 are not ace, king, queen, jack and 10. All numbers must be in a row, however. (2,3,4,5 and 6 or 8,9,10, jack, queen for example). This means simply four cards of the same kind. The full house in five card draw poker contains 3 cards of one kind and 2 cards of another kind.

The straight contains 5 in a row. In the event of a tie, the player with the highest pair wins.

Then they resumed the search they cut short due to weather (6), and found the key. Later they entered looking for a garage door opener (7). Those were the "seven searches" the tv show is talking about. The key was found on the 6th entry, on the continuation of one actual search. The other entries were brief, and looking for specific items, and they wouldn have found the key on any of them.

Though it could take a number of months before we get a final conclusion in California, this is the first time a bill without a so called 'bad actor' clause has been introduced, he said. Addition, the inclusion of the racetracks may provide added support for the bill. The other online poker bill up for discussion which was introduced in early December does contain a bad actor clause but ultimately gives California regulators the final discretion on who will be allowed to operate in the market and the conditions imposed.

Your comment made me think about how DH has approached realizing what he did badly and how he made things better. I had a major concern which I voiced to our therapist that DH was going to transition from living his life to make his mother happy to doing the same to me because he only knows how to be a servant. I thought about how he speaks to me, how he approaches working on things, and it sheepish? Like he unsure of what he doing and nervous. And while that could be considered a bad thing, it positive to me that his reaction is something I never seen before and makes it seem like what he doing is entirely new and something he not experienced in because he not just approaching me like he did his mother. In the past with his mom it was cold, distant, "ok this is how I be now" or "ok this is what I do for you, happy now?". He would shut off a part of himself to serve his mother. In collecting his thoughts, taking pauses, being unsure but positive, and confusingly smiling it shows me that he trying really hard to consider all he learned in therapy and about me and trying to actually integrate it into his life rather than destroy part of his life to make me happy. The concept of compromise is very, very new to him and I think what I been seeing is what it looks like when he tries to compromise.

There are multiple types of aim assist and every game implements them in some sort of combination specific to that game. I assume the OP is talking about auto rotation or "snap aim", where your weapon will snap on to the target when you ADS if you are close enough to the hitbox.

On your last point I think people with broad familiarity to literature, (as well as fans of history and Shakespeare) are far more likely to dislike this movie.

Because of this, the figures quoted throughout are largely taken from the 2006 nationwide census, which lends a somewhat dated feel to many of the chapters.For, whilst the 2006 census results show a very rapid increase in the number of Asians in NZ, whether as new arrivals or as born here, the 2013 census results   touched on really only in the Afterword   ram home just how massive this expansion has become. Because in 2013 Asians identified as 11.8%, double the sum of the 2001 census, and out of this 11.8%, 31.6% were overseas born (See Figure One below).

You have enough room to create a notch and many commercial brakes have 2 notches cut out for that reason, and also perhaps so you can adjust what direction you want the compensation to go. The AKM muzzle brake is intentionally offset to account for the imbalance of the bolt carrier, and with the AKS 74 being even lighter it might make sense to just run it in the current notch. Either way, if you cut a notch you be fine, it doesn take any load and you have enough clearance.

Personally I would do it ASAP because of the issues. Otherwise I just wait until the blooms have fallen off naturally before repotting. Once you repotted (either moss or bark) you can test how moist it is in the middle using a bamboo skewer. With moss it usually took me to water about once every two weeks but with bark I water once a week. Unless it been super humid or cold. When I do buy a new orchid I wait until the blooms fall off then just repot right after so I can see what going on in there. Anyways, that was long! I hope that all helps and orchids are very tough plants, they usually bounce back but it takes a long time.

So Naoto story basically being like "I a trans dude in all but name, I have body dysphoria and want to be a man, also the gay guy who has a crush on me found out that I AFAB but still is totally hot for me" turning into the annoyingly common in the little bit of female gendernoncomforming media in Japan that exists trope of "oh she just needed to find the right guy to fuck romance the feelings out of her" was horrifying to me.

And according to the American Journal of Public Health, alcohol is the most dangerous factor in tub related deaths with intoxication and drowning as the cause of 38 percent of all hot tub related fatalities [source: Press].

IMO it is a dangerously radical political device that reads like a progressives wish list. It lumps the objectives of climate change with other agendas like guaranteed wages for everyone, union rights, the gender wage gap, racism, protecting communities of color. It's not that I don't agree with those things and want them too, but I think it is dangerous to tie them together like this because you politicize climate change and you alienate the right and moderate politicians.

The Henderson City Council will vote tonight on a four month ban to prevent new massage parlors from opening and give staff time to craft new rules to crack down on prostitution in the industry.The 120 day moratorium would stop the licensing of any new massage establishments until September.The target of the new rules would be massage parlors that engage in prostitution and human trafficking.City Attorney Josh Reid said the vast majority of the city's 83 massage establishments follow the law, but there are a few "bad apples" that need to be weeded out.The current enforcement strategy focuses on issuing misdemeanor citations to individual workers caught breaking the law, whether for prostitution or any other violation of regulations.

Obviously this is just an estimate and doesn account at all for the inevitable increase in demand for soybean milk (now that we eliminated livestock), soybean oil, nor other soybean industry production needs. This is purely a discussion on the protein needs the planet would have if it depended on soy instead of meat and, as stated before, even more plant based protein would have to be consumed to make sure the population gets all 9 amino acids (a complete protein diet). Yet this estimate still gives one an idea of how much industrial agriculture would need to increase to accommodate just the protein needs of the planet. Soy is the richest source of plant protein popularly consumed by humans, so other plant based protein sources would have to increase even that much more in a vegan utopia.

Today, it couldn't be more evident to me how much the music has been hijacked, especially rap/hip hop. If you listen to the lyrics it's just repeating bullshit talking about cooking up crack, popping pills, drinking codeine, violence, and materialism. It's obvious they want their listeners to be drug dealers/users who self harm and bring down the rest of society while chasing material bullshit instead of reaching a higher level of consciousness and uniting to change the world.. 
The usual advice is to play a variety of tracks and raise them to As before moving to the next level. If you only play your favorite tracks, you may miss out on certain chart patterns and come back to bite you on higher levels. 
When you play higher stakes, your total range (and balance) matters a lot more due to your opponents actually paying attention and having good theoretical knowledge themselves. If you are talking about microstakes or 1/2NL at the casino, you can probably c bet a huge % of the time and get folds from your opponents.To answer your questions specifically:1) c bet bigger against stations  depends on board texture and how often they are calling.

While the film is charming you with its romantic comedy affectations, it slyly doing another kind of work as a commentary on class: Rachel back ground is working class, while her college roommate Goh Peik Lin, a Singapore native, is hilariously rendered as nouveau riche then the Youngs are so old money, they don even talk about it.

She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York.

 4 points  submitted 18 hours agoSaw Captain Marvel with some friends at midnight, and I enjoyed it! The 90s music was nice and they weren overt about the "female power" theme, which I know was a lot of people gripe going in (which was dumb anyway).The way it set up is kind of odd (not gonna spoil what I mean by that), but it seemed necessary given how it played out.

At the time of writing I been up since 2am, have worked 7 days a week almost nonstop for the past couple of months, have slept in my car more times than I slept in my bed in December, have gotten sick from exhaustion and sleeping in my crappily insulated car and burned myself out hard because of all the extra shifts I picked up, and have been pushing to finish management training at my job so I can push out applications for manager positions by next month end.
Pretty much this. The fact that Frank is glorified and seen as some kind of badass shows just how fucked up our society has gotten. When TV shows torture and absolutely insane amount of hardcore violence but refuses to show things like the naked body you know we have gone off the rails..

My most recent instant was just the other night: a man was practically counting the ice cubes that went into his soda cup, and when he said that was too much and my concessionist poured some out, he got angry.

If we ask voters "Do you think Obama should be doing more to cooperate with Republicans in Congress" they will often say "yes" and then we interpret that as the cause for the loss of popularity among the Dems.But if we asked voters "Do you think Obama policies are significantly different than Bush and people said "no" then we could use that to explain the drop in the Dems popularity.The truth is, if the new administration and the Democratic controlled Congress do not take this moment to create a radical break with the former administration  end the wars, stop giving wealth to the banks rather than the people, hold the Bushies accountable, etc.  then, statistically speaking, a growing percentage of Americans will not see change, but more of the same.

The prime example of such reactions occurs in the interior of stars, where temperatures are of the order of 20 million degrees Centigrade. At this temperature the average energy of an atom is still only 1,700 electron volts much less than the energies given to nuclear particles in "atom smashers." But all the particles present nuclei and electrons have high kinetic energy, so they are not slowed down by colliding with one another.
