A second trailer would see Timberlake describe the project as "modern Americana with 808s," while gushing about "Southern guitars and that sound that feels like heritage." Two days later, as if on cue, second single "Supplies" would drop and fly in the face of what the singer was preaching. It wasn't until the third and fourth singles arrived, the Chris Stapleton featuring "Say Something" and the album's title track, respectively, that we finally got the first examples of what he'd been promising. And then, odder still, while previewing tracks on Twitter ahead of the album release, Timberlake told fans, "By the way, the album is named after my son, OK? His name means 'of the woods,' so stop telling me I'm making a country album." Excuse us?.

Nataree is one of many soapy massage joints along Ratchadaphisek Road, which is ever so slightly outside the downtown area. The nearest public transport is Huay Khwang subway station. Take exit 3 out of the station and walk in the same direction that you come out of the exit (opposite to the flow of traffic). After about 2 minutes, you will find Nataree on your right, set back from the road. Just after a Thai restaurant, dip in to the little enclave and you will see Nataree. Actually, there are two Nataree joints, but go in the first one (or, when facing them, go into the one on the right). I believe the other one is a standard massage venue. 7/10

What utter contempt could a person harbour for the democratic aspirations of millions of human beings who poured their heart, body, and soul into the streets and squares of their homeland to consider a juvenile delinquent's power mongering an "Arab Spring from the top"? What high school, what college, what school of journalism did this man drop out of to utter such hogwash and get it published in the New York Times?

Oh dear! I think you may have read my first comment wrong, I do not have double standards, I never outright said it was a horrible racist thing I just meant it was rude and kind of mean towards the race OP was, this is because in her example she gave, the comment was not "I not usually attracted to people of your race" and instead "you are attractive for a member of your race" which implies they believe that OP race is ugly or bad, rather then that they just have a preference (which is fine, you don need to be attracted to everyone) and when you imagine it in a scenario, saying something like (and I just using this ethnicity as an example) "your hot! for an asian." rather than "I not usually attracted to asians but I think you hot" is a bit rude.

In a way, it works as an exploration of why Victorian mores were so deeply flawed, with the undercurrent that women are little more than the property of their husbands, baby incubators and mentally children themselves. We see an obvious version of this theme with Monmouth and the Duchess (he literally called her property in this episode) but in Albert his transformation is all the more repulsive considering he's supposed to be the enlightened one the dreamer, not the soldier, as Victoria reminded him here.

The paraffin facial treatment works well on many different types of skin, including aging skin. It is not advisable, however, for people who have really sensitive skin, oily skin, or skin with blemishes to get a paraffin facial.

This treatment will get rid of unwanted toxins and help restore the skin so that it looks and feels better than ever. Here are the steps you will need to follow in order to properly apply a paraffin facial.

When they talk high percentage, they mean something that will present frequently enough that it will end up in the news. Say there a 1% chance of blood in urine and 50,000,000 people are administered the vaccine in a one month span. The news will take an interest in 500,000 people with bloody urine. From a military perspective, you have a higher chance of getting exposed to biological weapons (small pox or anthrax for instance), and so the risk of you pissing blood for a couple of days is better than the 30% chance of you dying if you contract small pox (probably better with modern treatment) or 80% for inhaled anthrax.

I don know. Difficult to dissect a villain actions when they end up seeming so irrational, but I have a hard time finding very many value hands that ever take this line on this board. Do you think a set check/raise flop, then open jams a flush turn? The only reason a 1/2 player would c/r this flop in a three bet pot would be if they were afraid of a flush, in which case they slow down when it hit..

I didn't have any ill feelings towards myself or the baby, only towards her father.I believe I started looking into it when I made some comment that was really rude when he asked me a question, and he gave me a look of shock.

For a hair and make up team that hadn't styled a show professionally to date, the IFAP's team debut was worth acknowledging. The red lips from L'Oreal's versatile 'I am Red' palette and simple kohl lined eyes were well executed.

I notice how much better people seem to treat me than they treat other immigrants from India, China, Turkey, ect. And it makes me feel really shitty. I enjoy the positive attention of course but I'm certainly not proud of my western/whiteness it's just a random way that i "lucked out" when I was born and it's evidence that even in 2019 racial profiling and racism in general is still very much alive. 
There is a very long standing, deeply connected, and barely secret community around the participation in and facilitation of child abuse in the industry, and it extends publicly to the protection of the jobs and images of the abusers. We've all likely heard rumblings or accusations about so and so, and what little public discussion there is quickly disappears, and said person goes on their merry way.

There's been a lot of excellent analysis and advice about the really awful sexual abuse that your husband has been regularly dishing out.

I expect them to release this game as budget/free (with less initial packs) and add incentives in the coming months as revenue comes in and they can figure out how many servers to buy/rent.

Different games will have different rate of returns, meaning some games, if you win, will give you a higher percentage of your money back and others will give you a lower percentage.

Finally, with the uncertainty of a nuclear future and threats all around stories where death was neither friend, nor foe, but friendlier than our fears would manifest helped mollify an ambiguous threat that somehow seemed more ready than ever before.Edit: many grammar mistakes and redundancies, I wrote this between breaks at workits_the_green_che  1 point  submitted 9 months agoLockdown drills are common in schools even before all this school shooting started.

I love Tuesdays for the farmer market at . Right by the water and several vendors with great food they have grown or they made as in soap, lotion, bread, cookies. I had pictures of that as well.

They always have a sign up to where money is being donated for that day.

My wife and I got married at a pension on GangHwa near Gyeonggi do (I think. have to check). Rented the entire place. Brought all our guests on Buses from Busan. Hired the best (at the time and in my opinion) bar band in Busan and brought them as well. Bought all the alcohol from a friend who owned a bar in Busan and shipped it up on the bus. Got flowers delivered from the central flower market in Seoul. Got a caterer to deliver the standard feast to the pension. Was amazing fun and most of the (main family and friends) guests slept at the pension and partied all night. It was cheaper (even factoring in buses from Busan to Seoul and private catering) than a lot of my friend wedding halls and sooo much better.

Go out on dates. Dedicate at least one day each month for a date with your wife. When you go out on a date, leave the children at home with a babysitter. The date is for the two of you only.

Keep the atmosphere romantic to keep your wife feeling sexy.
While there are orgs like Cloud9 that justify a permanent spot because C9 is literally the most successful org across multiple titles next to maybe EnvyUs and Liquid.

You could probably trick it though :), not sure if the orange 3.3v wires from the PSU would be enough but you could run one of those in the cable that goes to the mod and connect that to the balance charging pins on the board, it would now see 3x 3.3v, it would think the batteries are low but it should still fire. OR, connect one of these to a red 5v wire in the PSU which will reduce the voltage to 4.2v, and run that into the mod for the balanced charging pins! Then it should think there are 3 fully charged (4.2v) batteries attached :).

Furthermore, using the redundant english name has the benefit of being a useful name for both the informed and uninformed, while using the korean version without a suffix only serves its purpose for the informed.

This quote is from a speech by (Rabi) Israel Goldstein1 as head of the Zionist Organization of America appeal and was made in 19442 the British White Paper of 1939 on Palestine and allowing Jews to immigrate to escape "the hands of the Nazi executioner" in Europe. Among many other things the White Paper limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for 5 years (1939 1944) with limits of further immigration to be determined by the Arab majority. "Were our pleas for the opening of the doors of Palestine headed in the past few years, at least 300,000 lives would have been saved. Unfortunately, even the immigration of Jews within the limited quota of the White Paper was not facilitated as it might have been" wrote Goldstein. is a long and complicated history to the White Paper but suffice to say that while millions of Jews were being slaughtered in Europe the restrictive White Paper remained in place, which meant that the haven for escape to Palestine was largely closed relative to the numbers of people needing to be saved, and that at the end of the war there were still 3000+ visas that hadn yet been granted. Goldstein makes the case for the extreme peripheral usefulness of the Paper in 1939, but in 1944 when the Axis influence in the Middle East was minor adhering to the white Paper was a tragedy: "if the White Paper was unwise and unworthy then, it is more shameful and baseless now"3.

I effectively sold you an item for $1K, but now you have evidence that it actually worth 100x that.

Since 1937, a pool of 268 males who graduated from Harvard University have been analyzed, scrutinized, summoned and surveyed by a collection of doctors, psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, psychiatrists and physiologists.

InSight HP3 deploys about one week after the seismometer is in place. InSight arm will place the heat probe on the ground, and it will begin to slowly burrow down from its location. The mole at the end of the probe slowly burrows into the ground like a self hammering nail. It hammers down for up to four hours at a time; each four hour period is known as one "hammering cycle." As it descends, it stops roughly every 19.5 inches (50 centimeters) to generate a pulse of heat. The probe watches how this pulse of heat travels through the subsurface material around it. It monitors how quickly or slowly the mole heats up the surrounding soil; this is known as measuring the "thermal conductivity" of the soil.

I enjoyed the video and felt for him during that end rant (I want a new Valve HL game as much as the next guy), but Yahtzee explicitly stated that shovelware games like Hunt Down the Freeman somehow overpower and "drown" games like A Hat in Time on Steam, and that Valve are responsible for that. I decided to check if that actually the case, because it sounds like a pretty fantastical assertion.

I'm on both sides of this. On the one hand I really do make an effort to be friendly. I greet people who sit down, I try to make a bit of conversation and have fun. On the other hand, when you play poker 2000+ hours a year, it's work. Sometimes you are tired, sometimes you are having a bad day and trying to avoid tilt, sometimes it gets monotonous, so I'll just put in my headphones and listen to music. In general I try to be good for the game and have a good time but other times I just need to chill.

At least one sibling in each pair was autistic, and every child was interviewed by researchers to confirm that diagnosis.If autism was entirely a genetic disease, then scientists would expect that if one identical twin had the disorder, the other twin would too.And they expect that among fraternal twins, if one twin had the disorder, then the other would have a slightly higher risk of developing autism than the general population.Previous studies have indicated that if onenon twin sibling has autism, other siblings have about a 5 percent chance of developing the disorder.But in the study, researchers found that only about 60 to 70 percent of the identical twins had dual autism diagnoses lower than expected   and 20 to 30 percent of the fraternal twins had dual diagnoses much higher than anticipated.Those rates, along with the expected rates scientists would find if autism was entirely genetic or entirely environmentally caused, were plugged into a mathematical equation, and researchers determined that only about 38 percent of autism risk could be tied to genetics.rates for the (fraternal) twin pairs were so high, I retyped all of the results because I thought we mixed them up, said Dr.draws attention to the environment, and to the possibility that shared environmental factors play a bigger role than we had previously assumed.

Going old school on your favorite nut varieties, for example, cuts those lectin levels dramatically.

The Common Strengths and Weaknesses of the Year of the Horse Person Strengths The horse people are generally energetic, noble, free spirited and clever. They have ingenious communicating techniques and in their community they always want to be in the limelight, so they have good friends and are well liked by many people. Although they sometimes talk too much, they are cheerful, perceptive, talented, earthy but stubborn. They are able to come up with new ideas and active at work and refuse to be reconciled to failure, although their endeavor cannot last indefinitely. The Horse person is a sociable likeable person most of the time, they can take advantage of this by getting everybody to work together to achieve goals. Weaknesses The Horse person is patient up to a point, but they can be hot tempered. If you pushed too far, the Horse person can lose their temper. They cannot bear too much constraint. They then lash out (just like a horse) at others which can undo the good relationships they have built up with their good social skills. They can also be stubborn just like a horse. They are wasteful since they are not good with matters of finance due to a lack of budgetary efficiency. The Horse person has many followers but they are not always receptive to other points of view. They tend to interfere in many things and frequently fail to finish projects of their own.

Our sense of self and identity is closely linked with our relationship with our senses. A particular song can evoke strong emotions and take us back to a particular time and place. A smell can remind us of a childhood memory. A touch can remind us of a particular lover. We tend to look at our senses in isolation, but what can be revealed if we bring them together, immerse ourselves in them? What impact will this have on our understanding of the relationships form and ultimately our sensual and sexual identities?

Disney is well known for doing unethical shit after weighing the cost of a lawsuit vs the cash gain. I have no doubt that after the movie was made and an opportunity to make a large amount of cash came up, their lawyers went into overtime looking for ways around what the paper said and their beancounters weighed the chance of a lawsuit against the amount of money they stood to gain. And a lawsuit would have backed them because, you know: They wouldn have done it without knowing they could win, or at least make more out of the deal than his suit would cost them..
