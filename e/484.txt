Social Security was set up as a pension plan for those who don have one and I, for one, would love to see it go back to that and not use to give some politician a golfing vacation. Even career politicians don have this. What I mean is, someone who has done business, negotiated with, and knows the culture of each country.

Mr McFate: Traditional strategists view war like an old fashion lightbulb: it either on or off. But this is wrong, and cunning adversaries like China exploit the space between war and peace for victory. The trick is keeping the American war switch flipped to "off" so it remains docile and at "peace."

When attention placed on you, suddenly administrators want to follow the exact letter of the law, to malicious compliance levels sometimes, just to avoid blame falling on them. Even if it involves firing a nurse or 12 without actually doing due diligence in making sure they did in fact commit the offence you firing them for.

Then I started working back down, picking up 2 stitches per row until I picked up all the turns (I like German short rows).

Tuesday is bean day and I usually end up making some kind of simple bean situation in the Instant Pot. This recipe (using Rancho Gordo cranberry beans, for example!) is wonderful and Bruno will eat at least three helpings of it. WHUT. I want to marry that recipe. The boys eat it plain or with a bit of bread and Hugo will have some avocado with it. We top it with cilantro and hot sauce and pickled onions and avocado. Sometimes, though, life is too crazy even for the Instant Pot and then I make a red or yellow lentil soup, which takes about 20 minutes and while Hugo will bellyache about it, both kids will usually eat it. (Obviously, it helps if I slice a hot dog into the soup, but I don always do that because I don want them to get used to hot dogs on the regular because I am MEAN and also sort of stupid seeing as we live in Germany and they already are used to eating them all the time everywhere gaaaaah.)

Cause and Effect plays a big role in the manga as it tends to use that tactic while mixing it up with mysteries and then having the brilliant idea of solving them and how a certain action affects other actions or thoughts. It begins with Kotoko Iwanaga, the story revolves around her as the tale begins when she was 11, who at that time was taken away by spirits known as and then made her into a goddess of wisdom by taking one of her eyes and one of her legs.

For the most part, people are tired of war I feel. It mostly the youth who are angered by the oppression of their people for so long, and so it is the youth who go on the streets to march and protest, and the youth who end up dying, fueling this cycle of violence. Most people want an independent Kashmir, but I don know who the right person to be who would lead this cause. We have no Mandela, we don have a Gandhi, and if we did they would probably be labeled a terrorist and be bombed and killed.

In germ free mice, the adaptive immune system is undeveloped. Since gut microbiota are essential for immune system development, germ free mice can be considered to have a low level of inflammation. When we consider the link between inflammation and anxiety like behavior, we observe that a low inflammatory state is associated with low anxiety like behavior, whereas higher levels of inflammation lead to increased anxiety like behavior.17 For example, infection with the parasite Trichuris muris in mice results in gut inflammation and increased anxiety like behavior.24 In addition, chemically induced gut inflammation in an animal model of colitis also results in gut inflammation and increased anxiety like behavior.24 Evidence that the microbiota acts as a modulator of this immune related increase in anxiety like behavior is provided in the same reports stating that treatment with probiotic Bifidobacterium longum alleviated the anxiety like behavior.24,25 These observations suggest that probiotic treatment may have potential for treatment of inflammation and related anxiety symptoms.Commensal bacteria play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal tract, and in situations of stress or disease, increased intestinal permeability can contribute to increased inflammation.26, 27 Increased intestinal permeability, sometimes referred to as "leaky gut," can lead to translocation of bacteria out of the lumen of the GI tract across the intestinal layer.

That's what happens in a LTR. You have moments of being not that into it but doing it because you love your SO. I've been with my husband for 13 years and through 4 kids. Any sexual issue there could be. we've probably been through it. It's rare when we both are turned on, awake enough, and interested at the same time (or that happens and my period is really heavy or a kid starts throwing up or I don't know.). Honestly at this point we are basically scheduling sex because I am a morning person and exhausted at night. But trying to get him to wake up in the morning for sex is a no go. My sex drive at this point is much higher than his unfortunately and I'm the one thinking "was that a sigh, maybe he isn't interested".

Many fitness professionals incorporate the chop and lift as a complete upper body workout program, while others use it to enhance global muscle pushing and pulling lifts. The movements are hard to classify because they incorporate both pushing and pulling vectors.However, there are many more functional movements occurring in a chop and lift than simply pushing and pulling, making it a valuable to exercise in rehabilitation.Chopping and lifting is based on PNF patterns that are spiral and diagonal.When two hands are involved together in the same direction, crossing the midline of the body in a downward or upward movement, it is called a chop or lift; whereas in the world of PNF, independent hand exercise is simply called D1 or D2 patterning and then the direction of movement is named by flexion or extension.These are advanced movements based on patterns used in physical therapy.Building a movement based rehabilitation program including rotational, spiral and diagonal patterning is essential in long term core functioning of the body.The goal is to prepare your client for susceptible movements found in activities of daily living associated with a high risk of back injury (flexion and rotation).Chopping is the downward movement across the body from a high position to a low position, and lifting is the upward movement from a low position to a high position.They are essentially mirror images of each other.

Capitalism is a proxy for god/fate/destiny and "the way life is" but communism actually tries to alter the status quo where people suffer and die needlessly. Because communism actually tried to make life better and sometimes didn't succeed, it's much much worse than capitalism, which never claimed to value human life in the first place. Their logic is undeniable; just keep parroting "100 million fucking deaths" while burning fossil fuels, cooking the planet, and profiting from the horrors that await.

Ah, so vegans only buy from local vegan farmers and don utilize crops produced from industrial agriculture, therefore keeping their hands clean of the primary reason animals are endangered/extinct. Gotcha, because otherwise I would just say they self righteously ignorant morons whose survival depends on the death of animals (who were never intended to die, like livestock) just as much as anyone else I making myself clear? Does any of that make sense?We always used tools to kill animals. A significant part of our rise to apex predator was due to our ability to create tools (after the discovery of fire and being able to cook meat giving us bigger brains). Lions don need tools because they do have sharp claws, but we have brains that allow us to develop tools to help us outsmart our prey.

I wonder if it a sort of cognitive dissonance in action. As Trump sinks deeper and deeper into the shithole, it becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain the illusion that he as great as they all want to believe. It pretty clear that his presidency has been a disaster, and a majority of the country, not to mention most of the world, now view (and treat) him as little more than a toddler. He hasn gotten anywhere near the respect that his cult was so sure he would garner, and the thousand year reign of the alt right now seems less and less likely by the day.

So even if you are all playing the same Nash equilibrium, you could still lose because your opponents are teaming up against you (either intentionally or unintentionally).You also run into the "equilibrium selection problem" where there are multiple Nash equilibria and you might play one while the other players might play a different one. So you can simply compute a Nash equilibrium and play your part of it, because you don know if the others will play their parts of the same equilibrium.

Sitting at the bar, a collection of 15 18 very pissed, mainly English and American that were "doing China" were ushered in by their tour group leader, told to sit at the back and not obstruct toilets. They said they had "seen China by visiting the Great Wall and Xi Shanghai was their last stop". They got vodka get poured into a 2L coke bottle, drunk as much as they could still, ordered more. Tried to steal my lighter several times while sitting at the bar, coz they thought they could, everyone hitting on everyone but no one being at all attractive. Fortunately their seating area was somewhat to the back. Got angry when the 1 hour was up, told they were going somewhere else and there would be more drink, and herded out of the door. It was like watching unruly zoo animals being ushered around. I had never seen anything like it before, even from university pubcrawl days.
