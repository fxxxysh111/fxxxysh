We maakten een ommetje naar het mooie witte 17de eeuwse kerkje Church of the Saviour in Persi en zagen ook het Pushkin Museum in een mooi blauw huis, met daartegenover weer zijn standbeeld deze keer wel interessant want met geocache. Eerst wilden we kiezen voor de keten Mu Mu (herkenbaar aan de koe) helaas was dat een (druk) buffet en daar hadden we even geen zin in. We kozen uiteindelijk het terras van het Italiaanse restaurant San Marco uit, met een leuk uitzicht op het caf aan de overkant waar heel veel stoere motards waren. Gelukkig maar dat we iets hadden om naar te kijken, want het ging traag vooruit en het was ook een eerste kennismaking met de zeer kleine porties die je in Moskou krijgt. Gelukkig maar was er wat verder nog een McDonalds! Om kwart na 10 waren we terug op onze hotelkamer het was nog altijd licht buiten!

Unfortunately for me, PokerStars changed their cash games in a very negative way last year and I had to take a step back. Then, I got burnt out at poker, took a 6 month break, and had to take ANOTHER step back once I was ready to play again. But, I back at $100NL and winning and making decent money and both ENJOYING poker and SUCCEEDING at poker. To date, I never had to move down because I lost 10 buy ins. To go busto, I have to lose 10 buy ins at 6 different stakes in a row while I move down with each 10 buy in loss. I made over $20k at poker and hope to be on track to make well over $10k this year. All of that possible if you stick to the rules. None of it possible if you don Any "success" you luck box breaking the rules will be gone if you continue to break them. It not an opinion. It a mathematical fact. I just saying if you want your best chance to NOT lose your bankroll (the money you play poker with), you have to follow those guidelines. To some people, losing all their poker money is no big deal and they just reload with the next paycheck. To some people, they end up pawning valuables, borrowing money from family and friends, if not stealing.

I went to school (middle school through the first year of college) with a guy who ended up attempting to rob a fast food restaurant and shooting and murdering the manager who couldn open the cash register. The manager was a 23 year old who had just done a commitment ceremony with his boyfriend and they were planning on moving into a townhouse together. In school, I barely saw him because he was constantly getting suspended for fighting other students. He would have sudden outbursts in class   screaming, slamming items around the rooms, throwing desks and chairs. He shoved a teacher (who was rather elderly and should have retired years ago) and then I didn see him for a few years. I did a quick Google search to find out what he up to these days and I know he did time in prison, but it looks like he out now and changed his ways. He is coaching a kids football team and has a steady job.

How many of these Great Whites are swimming about I cannot say. I have to assume that if someone like me, who lives in a veritable shark cage of liberal institutions and progressive neighborhoods, has bumped into a couple of Great Whites, then there are a lot of them out there.

But what about the people who actually pay the wages of whiteness? The invisible white elites who are willing to share some of the privileges of racial hierarchy without extending anything like economic security or even health care to their brothers and sisters in racism?

However, if we look at what he actually does, his actions are to the good of the characters we perceive as morally good (or striving to be), and to the detriment of the greedy, corrupt, etc. So, is he good or bad?

To that end, it is to your benefit if you spend more time playing the game of poker rather than reading about poker strategies and things. Leave that to a time when you are better able to play poker without having to stop and think about whether or not you have a possible good hand or not!In short, use online poker strategy and game plays only when you have the knowledge and the know how to play poker properly.

The sheer scale of the universe is what leads most to believe there is probably life. Our galaxy has the mass of 100 billion of our suns, but probably has closer to the range of 200 400 billion stars of varying sizes. Solar systems (stars with planets) in our galaxy could be as high as 100 billion as well. The number of galaxies in our observable universe is between (on the lowest end of math using observed galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field image) 176 billion and (far more likely knowing the limits of the instruments) 2 trillion galaxies.

I noticed many things about this guy that were sure signs for anyone who was paying attention, that this guy was a TIGHT PLAYER. The first thing you obviously notice is that they do not play a lot of starting hands. They usually fold, in fact almost always fold unless they are in the blinds or have a strong hand. The second thing I noticed is that this guy kept counting and rearranging his chips every 2 seconds like he was losing them or something. Like seriously man, you haven played a pot in half an hour why in the world are you still counting your chips they haven moved! A third thing I found while studying this guy was that he slouched every hand. except for when he had a strong hand! In fact this guy was such a rock that I would call him a robot because he perked up everytime he found 10 10 or up. Now I have to admit, this was a pretty strong NL table and there were also a couple of drunks donating. With that being said, I had to laugh when even the drunk guys folded every time this rock tried to come in with a raise. That leads me into the next section of this article, how to easily handle any rock poker player once you have identified them.

And this for me is where there a disconnect. If the government is at this point anyways I rather be able to attempt to defend myself than just roll over and accept my fate. It seems defeatist to just throw up your hands and hope this fascist government doesn treat me too poorly. They don even have to "come for our guns" at that point if they all banned. There isn a single consequence for them doing whatever they want to the populace. There a few examples of guerillas holding their own against the US military. It pretty far fetched for that to happen in this day and age but I rather the government have to fear a push back then just be able to round up whoever they want with zero consequences.

So JTs might be better as a 3b bluff with a smaller sizing (maybe 2.5x?) than as a call. With like KJs or KQs you have more over cards to their pp so maybe these play better as a call. Obviously we'd have to do the math to see exactly what our best 3b are here, it might still just be better to go for raw equity with 3b, but just off the top of my head while sitting in the sauna my reasoning for raising the question is essentially this. You don't want to play a T or J on the flop really you're just dominated so often and OOP and their entire non paired range has straight outs and over cards outs. Even 99 will have back door straights often. So your real strength lies in implied odds like you said. If you hit a straight or flush or top two you're going to stack his strongest holdings often. So by 3b and cutting the SPR you're making it more likely that you will stack him if you get a strong holding while maintaining the ability to get away from marginal spots. Also it is very possible he will fold pretty much any non paired hand and maybe 99 JJ because he is so nitty I once shoved A6o for like 13bb on the button into a SB with 40bb and he showed me AK and mucked because he "didn't want to draw vs a made hand". And if UTG 4b you you have a very easy fold.
This is a very common situation in sit and gos, and understanding it is very important. An ace heads up with short stacks and nobody about to bust out is too good to fold, so forget about that option. Player A could call, but a lot of things can go wrong if he does.

As the stock market was pressing higher and higher in the summer of 1987, Martin Zweig had a feeling enough was enough.

In October, the market collapsed, and while the big averages lost a quarter of their value in one day, Zweig's portfolio rose 8.7 percent and 50 percent for all of 1987.

As a way of encouraging you to play more often, the majority of online sites offer something called "rakeback" and a rewards system to go along with it. The site will give you a portion of your rake back to you, sometimes as actual money or as a perk of some kind (pokerstars used to let you buy a car with your reward points, for example). The portion of the rake the site gives back to you changes depending on how much you pay.

There are numerous strange ruins and predicaments in the pacific that lead one to believe it was more prosperous than just island hopping tribes.It just as with Doggerland, the Azores, the Yonaguni monument, Alexandria, on the coastlines of India (particularly in the north, but even the myth of that bridge to Sri Lanka persists), the Yucatan (recently underwater caves with artifacts), Easter Island, and who knows what other coastal regions.

In english, gender and sex (used in the context of whats between your legs), are interchangeable, and ive no doubt that disphoria exists, and i believe it is in fact a mental illness (and there is research to suggest it is closely related to depression and is treatable), but just like every other mental illness, once it starts effecting how others live their lives you need help to go back to being normal; but with trans people for some reason we feed into what we know is a mental illness, and give it exactly what it wants. People dont like to talk about the fact that amogst all trans people, pre and post transition, or pre and post op, the suicide rate stays at a clean 40%, which tells me that transitioning solves absolutely nothing.

One of the important observations from the Dutch Hunger Winter Study was that intrauterine exposures that have long lasting consequences for adult health do not necessarily result in altered birth weight.

The great thing about this is that it has built in positions for up to 7 players and even a dealer. You might find you can barely fit six of you around the table at home comfortably and you know some people can see others cards because they are too close together.

Using Keepass with Dropbox on our iPhone, Android phone, tablets, Linux laptops and Windows desktops, always just worked. The downside? You had to alt tab to the app and copy and paste the password; however, many sites don use recognizable password fields, so you end up doing that with LastPass anyway. The worst thing about Keepass was the file wouldn necessarily get saved back to Dropbox properly, so we end up spawning copies of it and have to import them back into the original occasionally. But I see now that wasn that bad of a problem, and with a little more research and possibly a different Keepass client I bet that can be solved.
Once that is out of the way, June 2nd sees the start of the well named "Colossus," which last year saw no less than 22,374 hopefuls all stumping up $565. Can you even begin to imagine the logistics of a 22,000 runner "live" poker event? For starters, how many chairs, tables, packs of cards, dealers and poker chips will they need?

High society never cultivated him. Money opened some doors, but he was never really accepted. People would go to his parties, but make fun of him behind his back. In the 80s, New York society referred to Trump brother Robert and his then wife Blaine as "the good Trumps" and "the nice Trumps." He claims to have founded a club at Mar a Lago because the established country club, the B and T club, wouldn accept black or Jewish members, but the truth is that he and Ivana tried to get into the B and T. And were turned down flat.

If you are playing on the internet, this shouldnt be too much of a problem. But if you are playing in a real brick and mortar casino with real people, the last thing you want to do is to refer up a book on the best poker hands. And the last thing that you want to do is to mix up a Three of a Kind with a Full House; or imagine that you have a Royal Flush when all you have is a Straight! These kinds of blunders can cost you money and since that is the very last thing that you want to do, it is probably in your best interests if you become more familiar with the different poker hands.

Beginning this October, Fox on Friday nights will air "SmackDown Live," a two hour WWE wrestling showcase designed to attract a more apple cheeked cohort of male viewers. Fox's current Friday night lineup scares up an audience with a median age just shy of 57 rather creaky given that any viewer who's reached the half century mark is wholly invisible to the network's advertisers. Wrasslin' should bring those numbers down into the more mature end of the millennial spectrum.

Nor was La Tene art an exclusively "Celtic" art style; it wasn even purely "Celtic" in its genealogy. Based on an earlier and more conservative Halstatt style (probably innovated by earlier Celtic speakers), La Tene was significantly by Scythian, Etruscan and Greek art in regards to its incorporation of lifelike portrayals of animals exaggerated lines, detailed figural forms floral motifs and floral vegetal motifs respectively. So that all to say that yes, Celtic speaking people would have had recognizably "Celtic" artwork and objects, but so would speakers of other language groups, and that what we think of as "Celtic" artwork is essentially a synthesis of indigenous designs, Mediterranean and Eastern European motifs..

My daughter has a shade that is silver but when it is exposed to direct sunlight, it changes to purple. Very cool! Different colours work for different places, too. For example, a fairly neutral colour is a good choice for work, while a vivid colour that matches with the rest of your outfit works well for going out. If you're going to be seen with a partner, try to pick a colour that won't clash with their clothes either, particularly if it's the rather distressing shade of pink that Durham Maths graduates wear!

Surprisingly, it works against many people and a few people it makes them go super spazzy on me but since I have a wide range of thin value bets on turn..

Investigators from the University of Buffalo in New York found that smokers who ate fruits and vegetables an average of 4 or more times per day were 3 times more likely to be abstinent from all tobacco products, including cigarettes, at 14 month follow up. Haibach, MPH, the study is the first to longitudinally evaluate the relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and cigarette smoking cessation.The study was published online May 21 in Nicotine and Tobacco Research.According to Haibach, research on the diets of current smokers, former smokers, and persons who have never smoked (never smokers) indicates that dietary practices of current smokers are the least optimal and that the diets of former smokers begin to resemble those of never smokers with increasing duration of abstinence. Giovino, PhD, began to wonder about the direction of the relationship and added questions on fruit and vegetable intake to the questionnaire of a national cohort study he was conducting on adult smokers.I examined the scientific literature, I was surprised by the lack of longitudinal research on the topic, given such an expanse of cross sectional research findings, Haibach said.

I had the idea of cutting a plate for a 60% keyboard with shrunken holes for the switches to sit in the right place and then seeing how well things lined up, adjusting the placement of the cut outs if needs be. I have read the guide and found out that Vortex POK3R is exactly what I am looking for. But, unfortunately, shipping to my country will cost me around $60 70, while my budget is limited to $120.

Unfortunately this kind of reaction is not unheard off. I read stories a plenty of rape and molestation victims whose family told them to never talk about it because it actually shames THEM. Sometimes it a family member they want to protect.

The RetroPie joystick selection tool was developed to make the sort of set up you are looking for a simpler process.With the tool, you should be able to assign the XBOX controller for PSX and the SNES controller for the other systems. In addition, you should be able use whichever controller is assigned to navigate the RGUI, including using Hotkey+START to exit, removing the need for the keyboard altogether, which seems to be causing issues in the first place.JerikTelorian  163 points  submitted 5 months agoThat part of it, but the other part is that the Covenant didn understand almost any of their tech.

The first law is fine, both sides having type s  > s. The second law is problematic. Our first sign of trouble is that it allegedly has type (r  a)  > (r  a), but this is a type error because, as GHC would put it, type variable 'r' would escape its scope.
We committed right now to putting the rules to vote yearly, so there will be another opportunity (and more in the future).Another thing is that the questions should have straight yes or no options without this ranking thing.

Abuse is insidious, and once you been abused long enough, you can become numb and acclimated to it. This is what some of survivors refer to as a "broken normal meter". To you, locking you in a room and refusing to let you out for 24 hours was slightly alarming, enough that you post to reddit but not so much that you would call 911. Someone with a well calibrated "normal meter" would have called 911 immediately, because not only is that shit not normal, it so far beyond normal that he looks like a psychotic criminal who might become a murderer. It fucking nuts!
" In a CSIS analysis, they suggested that, rather than confronting each other, Europe and Russia "should engage in a dialogue in order to re negotiate more flexible pricing and other contractual terms, " while coordinating on issues like infrastructure and supply logistics and adapting to a rapidly evolving energy market.

Motivate people. Why are the employees there? What keeps them with your organization and stops them from going somewhere else? What makes the good days good?

Corporations, bureaucrats, generals, and pretty much anyone who has gotten used to the good life without having really earned it, OKB has been implemented across the board in Pakistan's 60 year old history. So for the General to go ahead and do it is neither surprising nor is it unusual. What's sad to see is that the goats he has fattened for the past 9 years are neither willing to stand up for their patron nor are they willing to throw their support behind him. 
Since any number we roll must be either odd or even, then the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of a pair of dice is one. 
Moreover, Barack Obama has exquisite oratorical ability and John Boehner has demonstrated the ability to obtain sufficient support from his troops for choices they found highly distasteful. It is not persuasive to reduce Washington's current dysfunction to the failings of political leaders.. 
Women have been bitching about equal rights for the longest time. I imagine it would be annoying when someone points out that women should probably actually fight for equality instead of just things that benefit just them.

Anyway, over the summer (I was visiting my dad), Ava I guess had talked herself up into a frenzy that her ex husband was abusing her kids and not treating her right, and so she bought a gun. When their father came to pick them up for their weekend she stepped outside, shot him until the gun was empty, then went back inside cool as you please to let him bleed to death on the sidewalk. He died, she went to jail, and the girls were sent to live with their aunt.
As for the WWE Champion Bryan, he will be defending his eco friendly title against Owens, who is returning from a long hiatus following knee surgery. It wouldn be a surprise to see members of The New Day get involved in the match after Vince McMahon denied Kofi Kingston a title shot at the pay per view. It also wouldn be a surprise to see Mustafa Ali make his presence known after saving Owens from a lopsided beatdown this past week. Whatever happens in this match will become a key storyline for the SmackDown brand through early April.

Let me say it again. Cheney told the CIA to lie. And yes, the lying was not of the usual sort since the CIA didn even bother to keep the Gang of Eight informed  leaders from both parties on the Intelligence committees who even according to the infamous NSA 1947 memo must kept in the loop on torture, illegal assassinations and the like. And when Nancy Pelosi accused them of lying, the GOP tried to silence her with intimidation, threats, and making her more evil than Cheney.

True, at the end of each problem the audience votes and the story with the most votes each episode wins money. It very different show than Jerry Springer though. Often celebrities (like BTS) are guests, which gives it more credibilty , in my opinion.

Ok but what if you get a remote speaker and set it to play some preset audio files at random times. Hide it in your city at very difficult to find places and if the cops don find it, move it every few days to different locations and hide it again. The audio files should contain like Gunshots, domestic violence sounds, loud crass gangsta talk, random fighting sounds, sounds of people begging for mercy, racist KKK rally talk, and sounds of people smoking dope.

St Clerans was in fact two buildings: The Little House (formerly the steward house ), beside the stables, was where Ricky, Tony, Anjelica and a nurse lived; while the Big House, renovated by Michael Scott, was filled with Huston treasures which he had accrued during his travels. When Huston was home he would stay in the Big House. The children would be thrilled to be invited for breakfast, where they would often meet a new mistress (even if they didn make the connection at the time ), who was always kind, and who made friends with them. Anjelica was too young to appreciate why her mother, a stubborn victim of Dad rejection could look so sad.

The simplest way is of course to just walk up to him and ask. You can say, "Mr. Shepard, will you please do me a favor? Would you please check the lint vents and clean them for me?" Maybe you can bribe him with an apple pie or ask him in a way that makes it seem like you don have time. You could use the old pity me because lines.

The poker faced, almost docile demeanour of Andy Roberts, who was born today, hid the merciless soul of a great fast bowler. His stock bouncer, quick and nasty, was simply a softener, a prelude to the real thing, which was close to unplayable. Lithe and effortlessly economical in his run up, Roberts did not benefit from coming into a great West Indies side (only one of his first seven five fors came in victory). He famously blew India away in Jamaica in 1982 83 with three wickets in an over to allow Viv Richards to hammer West Indies to a victory target of 173 inside 26 overs.

Another potential issue is bacterial contamination of vessels and habitats. There been a fair amount of research into this area, and there are some potential solutions on the horizon, but proper waste management and sterilisation are only the beginning of this problem for astronauts trapped in confines for months on end. Commensal bacteria are usually harmless, but in a space environment, it entirely possible that immunodeficiency could cause opportunistic infection, or that viruses may evolve, or that the Martian soil itself contains pathogens hitherto unknown to medicine.

By this point, everyone knows that unscrupulous banks helped set off the worst economic meltdown since the First Depression by lending money at criminally high interest rates to people who could not possibly afford to pay the loans back. The Subprime Mortgage Crisis probably began as early as 2006 but was ignored since it primarily occurred in urban areas and in Black and Latino neighborhoods. It was the inevitable collapse of these mortgages that was the gasoline on the slow burning embers of 30 years of unregulated greed..

I truly and deeply believe that the most critical battlefield in the fight for gender equality is in childhood.

Then there are 5 possible oddnumbers that he can roll . . . 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. So there are five possible ways to get apoint. == I have a feeling that what you really want to know is:What's the probability that Pablito will win a point with (one roll and one toss).

On a roll of the dice alone, the probability would have been 45.5percent. But if a coin toss also has to come up favorably, you cut thechance of winning in half.(Full Answer)
