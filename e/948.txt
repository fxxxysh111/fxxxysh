Remember last August 17 when Frandsen went 3 for 5, with one homerun and two doubles in San Diego? He looked like the real deal that day. I still hopeful that he can have a breakout game this year that will snap him out of his funk. He still has time to prove himself, but he needs to do it now. The bright spot is he putting the ball in play, striking out only 17 times in 158 at bats. But as many of you have said, he sure does seem to hit a lot of groundball outs.
Then Joshua Tree came out and just blew the doors wide open. Everyone from indie/alternative fans to rock fans loved their music.

Lately, a harrowing 20 minute trek to Central Park also has proved an obstacle to sales. Broker Vickey Barron, who has sold in Sutton Place, says it "might as well be Guam." That might explain in part why nobody at the building is currently trying to sell   most recent sales have been from the estates of late owners.

It is usually wise to stand by the basics of poker, insert in a little flair, and create this kind of party enjoyable for everyone. A poker game party can be a great experience to get acquainted with the neighbors as well if you are new in town. 
I am talking about posts that get flooded with hundreds of "NTA. you should leave her" comments since these are more likely to sway posters.

Gaming channels most likely get flagged for doing lets plays because the studios may think uploading the whole game on YouTube could effect sales (i think it actually helps sales), especially when someone uploads a lets play right when the game releases. Sometimes channels get flagged because the background music/soundtracks, which flies over most people heads (turn the music down in settings).

To summarize, I absolutely love the challenge that NLHE has provided me, and coming from games with a much more linear learning curve, it makes me unbelievably excited to be part of a game with an essentially undiscovered skill ceiling. I never felt more incentivized by the difficulty and depth of a game I taken on, and the variance and requirement for mental and emotional fortitude only adds to that..

Indeed, Singapore has gone so gung ho on all things creative that it's building a Fame style academy in the heart of the city to unleash the singer, dancer and sculptor that's hiding in its youth.

Something to consider. 
Even if trapping wild predators was sustainable (it never is, at least on an industrial scale), trapping is a pretty horrific way to kill an animal. I don buy "humane" slaughter, but that is orders of magnitude better than ensnaring an animal and fucking up its leg, then leaving it exposed and starving for days before finally killing it in some other gruesome way. Not to mention the obvious ethical answer that it not okay to kill something just because you want to wear its skin around your neck to show other shitbrained zombies that you fit in with them

Kids aren't even exhausting. Those people make it exhausting by acting like taking care of a kid is so damn hard. Kids don't need to be entertained at the park for 10 hours. Most kids just want to do whatever the hell they want, I have 2 kids and all they want to do is play outside, I go to school full time and I gotta say those people in school that work full time sometimes 2 3 jobs and have to pay bills, worry about family, friends and keep up with school so they can get an even higher education is something I will never understand. I bow down to anyone with that much determination. And yes they are way more exhausted then I will ever be.

Budget considerations aside, Kovacs shone brightest on the small screen when he was given free rein. His movie career (not part of this box set) is largely a bore. In film, he was usually wasted as the good looking, possibly quirky   but never weird   sidekick: "Bell, Book Candle" (1958) with Jimmy Stewart, "Our Man In Havana" (1959) with Alec Guinness and "North to Alaska" (1960) with John Wayne. Kovacs was never given the chance to even try to approximate the innovations he'd done in television on the big screen. And having to pay private detectives as he searched for his kidnapped children while trying to keep the IRS at bay meant he couldn't be choosy about accepting roles.

Players look at their cards. Beginning to the left of the dealer, each player has a chance to place a bet up to the table limit. The first person could, for instance, place a bet of $5. It would then move to the next player who would either "see" this amount (and thus add in her own fiver), "raise" it (which would be tossing in that $5 and another $5 for the raise), or "fold" (which is where you lay your cards down and look at everyone else expectantly because you're done for that round and you don't think you're going to win. Or you just think that $5 is a bit too much to risk, being a conservative high roller who's willing to give up the ante you put in the pot). You keep going around the table until everyone has a chance to see, raise or fold, and if there are raises then each person who wants to stay in must match the bets made.

There was some dicks who would stay by the wall and block the balls that were thrown.

If people want to put themselves into that position in order to advance society then everyone should have a comfortable enough position to make that decision from. 
And then the "figuring out" is how that person feels loved (I think it's a lot more based on individual than the love language general ideas)The trick is that women think we know how we want to be loved (and I'm talking generally here, not just in marriage, but in friendships and family, too), when sometimes we don't. I can be upset and imagine a certain outcome where I would feel more loved and wind myself up into self pity, wanting that thing to happen; my husband chooses to do some other thing, (because he can't read my mind, plus he knows how to love me better than I do), usually ending up with the best outcome.

With pop music's sudden fascination with all things Americana (and perhaps more likely, with reaching a middle American audience who's been vocal about feeling ignored by mainstream entertainment), it's clear this trend isn't done just yet. Even Australian born international pop star Kylie Minogue, someone whose entire life couldn't seem further removed from the American South, is dabbling in the country influenced waters. For her upcoming fourteenth studio album, Golden, the majority was recorded in Nashville, a town that she admitted "had a profound effect on" her. The music video for lead single "Dancing" even finds the Aussie songstress doing her best line dancing boot scooting boogie.

"Every home has its own signature scent," Brashear says, noting that air is a complex combination of all odor molecules, like laundry and hair care products, lotion, cooking smells, or pet odors, stinky shoes and other undesirable scents. She says that the odor cycle affects every home, since there's usually nowhere for those scent molecules to go, especially when the house is closed up during the cold and hot weather months. So, when scent molecules get released into the air they move throughout the home, then they settle into the couch, carpet, drapes, etc. "Then, as soon as somebody plops down on the couch or there's a spike in humidity those molecules get re released into the air," she says. And while many of us make it a priority to regularly clean closets, baseboards and bathrooms, she recommends truly cleaning the air with products that trap odor molecules and eliminate them rather than simply masking them. "Air makes up more than 75 percent of the space in your home and it's really important and often neglected."

Ten or so years ago, insurance company trailblazers, largely in response to consumer demand, set up in house member access to CAM and integrative health care. Kaiser Permanente is a good example. Today, Kaiser members pay monthly premiums as well as ponying up for massage and acupuncture services a version of double dipping, it would seem, under Sec. 2706. With King v.

As a bronze plan member, one step up from catastrophic, I'm happy to have monthly premiums under $300, pay our trusted acupuncturist out of pocket, and be part of a co op network with $3 discounts for Film on the Rocks but a 22 percent increase seems a large year over year miscalculation by the CO HealthOP board.

They are more accurate that one would think, easy to fix in the field, easier to suppress with items simply found around us, they are often not as loud as a rifle, and certainly quieter than a shotgun, they do not have a short range, they are honestly harder to fumble or drop, less recoil means faster refire while retaining a general ammount of accuracy, and 9mm (the most common pistol round) can penetrate most surfaces at close range.

It impossible to consider the precise wants and needs of every single human being in a country. That means your money also gets spend on things you might not use.
Yeah this could be argued either way I think. Thandie was great and I glad she had as much screen time as she did. However, ERW had top billing and ultimately was the focal point of the show with comparable screen time. Maybe if ERW wasn so awesome then it could be argued that Thandie would deserve a best actress nod? I think the awards bodies play fast and loose enough with the rules that it would have been possible. Maybe Maeve will end up as the focal point next season and get her due. Either way I happy regardless of the awards nods they receive :)

Housing   Uni students living with parents likely have a longer commute, and if their parents have to pay for key money (not earning them interest) and rent that is money that won be available to them down the line when they marry, inherit, or need to care for their parents. So it does have financial impact, if not now then later. Plus, having free housing provided near your workplace is an extremely valuable benefit. You seem to have a very negative view of the provided housing, but it is typically adequate. Pretty small in the big cities but not uninhabitable as you claim, especially for EPIK, and it is furnished.

I don't think any of this is a short term plan but if you decide to do something based on the advice on this thread then you may want to track progress on a 6 month/1 year to see where you landed.

So do your best in whatever you do but most importantly focus on what you are good at so that someone will pay you for it. All the best!

So Wendi and I decided to head back to Turkey from Croatia. Maybe we were starved for the friendliness and hospitality, after a year with the dour Czechs. I can't even begin to explain the hospitality of the Turks. Even the carpet sellers would hassle us to buy carpets and we would tell them, "We don't have jobs or houses, why would we need a carpet?" and they would invite us in for a tea and a chat. And then they would recognize us and talk to us every time we walked by which meant Wendi and I couldn't walk faster than about a mile an hour in the areas of Istanbul we knew. I think the ritual of tea is one reason it's so friendly. Everyone invites everyone else for tea. There are little storefront rooms all around the city where elderly men just brew tea and coffee all day long, and young boys serve as the runners. Local businesses have these "chips" that they give the boys when they arrive with the tea. It's kind of like a system of credit. But I digress

Whether you are teaching young children or older students, it is good to have a variety of methods for explaining and practicing math concepts. Remember to be patient and encouraging, and you will help students of all skill levels to learn that math is not something to be afraid of, but a subject to get excited about.

The story goes into the steps that he took to find it; who he met to help develop the practice, and the woman who would eventually bring it to America.

I argue against two popular claims. The first is a descriptive, empirical thesis about the nature of ordinary human experience: 'each of us constructs and lives a "narrative" . . . this narrative is us, our identities' (Oliver Sacks); 'self is a perpetually rewritten story . . . in the end, we become the autobiographical narratives by which we "tell about" our lives' (Jerry Bruner); 'we are all virtuoso novelists. . . . We try to make all of our material cohere into a single good story. And that story is our autobiography. The chief fictional character . of that autobiography is one's self' (Dan Dennett). The second is a normative, ethical claim: we ought to live our lives narratively, or as a story; a 'basic condition of making sense of ourselves is that we grasp our lives in a narrative' and have an understanding of our lives 'as an unfolding story' (Charles Taylor). A person 'creates his identity [only] by forming an autobiographical narrative   a story of his life', and must be in possession of a full and 'explicit narrative [of his life] to develop fully as a person' (Marya Schechtman).

You might try an automatic feeder for his dry food. We got one that you can program by app to dispense a set amount of food at specific times. Right now our cat gets portions at 7am, 3pm, and midnight. We give him wet food once a day (around 8pm).

I'm not sure how much money Froch is making with poker, but my guess is he's not making the kind of money he would have received for a fight against GGG.

I didn get the impression that this area was necessarily the best spot for those stakes, but I DO think it would be better than most places. I think LA would probably be the best place to go specifically for a $5 big blind, and I want to plan a mini trip there to test those waters.

There are probably aspects of control / government power / censorship of ideas at some level. But I recall the initial censorship started back when there were all these kids and men who would get online and gamble until their eyes fell out or they were broke. And young guys would spend days looking at porn, to the point they would never leave the PC room. Self indulgence to an unhealthy level. Parents were unable to stop them, wives were unable to stop them, and they could not stop themselves. Confucianism, history of totalitarianism, miseducation, Korean democracy being in its infancy, hierarchical social structure, etc. In my opinion, it is because Koreans have never fought and won their own independence. Koreans don understand the concept of freedom of speech and press since the current democratic administration was handed down to them after the Japanese surrender. Even the Korean war was won by America, not the Koreans. America fought a war against the British and won their independence. The French had their revolution and the bourgeoisie chopped all the heads off the monarchs and aristocrats. Even China and Russia, their communist revolutionaries fought for decades before succeeding in their fight for control of their countries. Korea doesn have a history of fighting for democracy and succeeding. There have been independence fighters, demonstrations, etc. but none were successful and brought a clear victory to the Korean people. Therefore, democratic ideals that you see in western societies do not exist here.
The question is then whether or not legislative leaders can craft some sort of compromise in the five weeks that remain in the annual session, or have yet another stalemate over the future of gambling.

It will also give you hope that maybe one day if you practice long enough you could also win a big tournament.

Unlike what another commenter suggested, if the concern is itchiness/irritation I would not recommend using a strong, drying chemical exfoliatiant such as Stridex. What you need a gentle, fatty moisturizer. If the concern is ingrown hairs however, Stridex pads are great, but if you use those you definitely need to be using a moisturizer, as they contain 2% salicylic acid and are very drying.

Sure! Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (commonly called the "Mormon" Church) can technically drink whatever they want! Most members choose to follow the "Word of Wisdom", a health code they believe was revealed by God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Subsequent Church leaders have added 'addictive or habit forming substances' and in recent years have specifically mentioned energy drinks. How a Church member decides to interpret these guidelines is between he and the Lord. It is generally interpreted as alcohol, coffee, and tea. Some Church members may also choose to avoid hot chocolate, energy drinks, caffeinated sodas, or even all soda. It just depends on what they think is right. I know active members of the Church that are in good standing in the Church who drink caffeinated sodas on a daily basis. I also know Church members in good standing who do not drink any soda. I know active members who often drink energy drinks as well. In order to maintain a temple recommend, as most Church members do, they must avoid alcohol, coffee, and tea. Anything beyond that is their personal interpretation and decision. If you'd like to read the "Word of Wisom" for yourself, visit the "Related Links" below. (Full Answer)

Right there, the trap should become clear. Kvothe has been led to believe that his parents were killed by the Chandrian (and frankly, they probably were). But the entire premise of the "good guys" is entirely Machiavellian, even as the "bad guys" follow it as well. Kvothe conclusions are spurious and poorly grounded in logic, but the narrative handwaves these leaps very quickly so that you don see them. At the same time, we get hints that all is not as it seems in Kvothe view of the world. The kind Encanis vs the harsh priests. The unbending Iron Law vs Libertine Felurian. Even the double fudge earlier of Skarpi and one of the Adem using "The Enemy" rather than naming any figure. These all hint that Kvothe POV is wrong, even as he is completely convinced of his righteousness.

A leader who practices both energies knows when to step forward and when to delegate.

There isn't any kind of universal certification for day spas (though there are usually state licensing requirements). Just because a place calls itself a day spa doesn't mean it's going to have the specific services you're looking for. Most day spas have a selection of services listed with the price for each, which is generally referred to as "the menu." Call ahead or stop in and go over the menu before you schedule an appointment.

Mr McFate: Traditional strategists view war like an old fashion lightbulb: it either on or off. But this is wrong, and cunning adversaries like China exploit the space between war and peace for victory. The trick is keeping the American war switch flipped to "off" so it remains docile and at "peace." For example, Beijing goes right up to the edge of war or what America thinks is war in the South China Sea and then stops, but keeps what it captures or creates.

So where to liberals and progressives fit in? They are the opposite side that seeks to limit suffering as much as possible within the system because they can not help but empathize with others   it why they on the left of a center right system in the first place.

The 90s music was nice and they weren overt about the "female power" theme, which I know was a lot of people gripe going in (which was dumb anyway).The way it set up is kind of odd (not gonna spoil what I mean by that), but it seemed necessary given how it played out.

Back to Lubke: it seems an interesting book, and from what I can see in a very light review there is space devoted to different energy sources than those of 1927: he wrote on solar, wind, tidal, and nuclear ("Atomzertrmmerung") energy. An aircraft/space vehicle like this it is noted could make the Berlin NYC flight in about 1.5 hours. (Valier was also the first to lose his life in a failed experiment using liquid oxygen, establishing him in a very unfortunate category of "firsts", becoming probably the first person to lose their lives in rocket flight; this is a similar category to Thomas Selfridge, who became the first person killed in an airplane crash, a 1908 test flight for the army with the pilot Orville Wright.)

Last but not least I wonder if there would not be a better timing to get a sky to have more contrast to the skyline. The clouds on the top edge look interesting enough but are so monotonous towards the building tops/horizon that they lack impact on the whole image. And so does the uniformity of the water. There is no added value to the image by showing so much water. From the framing point of view I am not sure if it would not have a higher impact if less water and more sky was visible. Or generally a tighter crop to expose the density of the buildings rather than trying to show that wide of an angle.
