I get it was a spite comment, but as I said, I truly believe that in these moments people show their ugly feelings, the ones we know we should keep at bay because it not right and yet, we cannot not feel.. 
Musicians do rehearsals before their big shows. They would always have the feel of being onstage during rehearsals to prepare for their ultimate event. This can also be applied when joining a tournament. You can play a table and imagine you are at the last table of the tournament where every chip counts and your every move can determine victory or defeat. This will help you develop skills necessary in real tournaments.

Fast forward 10 years and I had started working at a large international development org in Australia. I met a man from Nagaland who also worked there.

I am not sure why some of you are taking this personally. Do you work for ACR? The person saying they do has been helpful so far, but I am not sure why you and the other poster seem to be taking this personal. I have been trying to resolve this with security for about a week.

He never specifically answered which of the three options was easiest to beat, but he did tell me that somebody playing (a solid game) live cash in Vegas, Atlantic City, Los Angeles, or Florida would win money considerably faster (on average) than a player who plays $500 $1000 tournaments, live or online. He doesn play online much, other than the couple WSOP online bracelet events every year, and thinks that online is much too hard to beat nowadays.

They have this at Woodlands Montessori preschool in Central up on Caine road. I take my son there twice a week. On the other side of this is a mock bank with cash in the teller, credit cards, and other things. It is actually a pretty cool play area. They have a whole town in various cubicles. They have a mock Firestation, Police station, restaurant, grocery store, and dolly nursery, and a full playhouse in the back room. When kids get old enough the bank and police stuff is perfect for cops and robbers. I think this board is more as a joke for parents, Never seen a kid ever really look at it. Parents see this on tours, and also like me you an adult is required when the toddlers are just starting out.

More than likely, you would like the chip set to impress. This is probably true even if you have no real intention of playing with the chip set. Even those simply looking to add a fine chip set to a personal collection would want one that is known for embodying a unique and brilliant visually design and appeal.
This might sound a little harsh, but you need to get off your  and start doing the everything you know needs to be done, in order to get where you want to be. You need to start doing things that you don't want to, or don't like, in order to get somewhere. 
As for your top down hierarchic power structure argument that's not what we're talking about. We can have a social democracy where the people control their own fates and power is distributed over the whole population, it doesn't need to be the few wielding power over the many as is inevitable in capitalism.

Just my opinion, based on what I learned in college psyche class. The fact that men and women are different in the way they think is not sexist. If I proclaimed one or the other superior, or was discriminatory based on it, would be sexist. To say that people are different shouldn't be automatically condemned. What happened to appreciating and even celebrating differences? I think when someone expressed an opinion they shouldn't be called inflammatory names.

Banana Shpeel is a risky departure for the 25 year old company, which has enjoyed stunning success around the globe.

Sometimes it is hard to look at hands and lay them down. But it's much easier to fold when your online poker calculator is flashing bright bold warning colors at you, reminding you how much  EV your hand has. This is especially crucial when you have just won or lost a hand or two previously, because at that point it's much more likely you will play your current hand as a result of previous hands. You may recognize that description as being on tilt. Now if you had a piece of advice to prevent you from tilting twice, three, or even 6 times during a session, wouldn't you call that valuable psychological help?

Anyway, there was a heart melting moment when we were waiting in line for equipment rentals behind a dad and a little girl who was probably three or four years old.

There always be some pros and cons with each different technique and the trick is to find the one that "pros" suits your structure and strengths the best, and make sure you aware of and compensating for the "cons".

Many employees feel that they are leaving crucial pieces of themselves at home just so they can blend in. When you bring your full self, you don't hide what makes you human, and it means others can too.

I don think it would be fair to argue that this person should go without communion or group worship. 10 points  submitted 6 days agoI think it degrades the sacraments to imply that there no relationship with God or obligation to God that comes with participating in them, and being in the Christian community.

This is the percentage we were looking for. You have to win roughly 43% of the time to make this call profitable in the long run. Alternately you can also calculate your pot odds by total pot/amount to call which in this equals to 1.23:1 or put in percentage 43%.

A couple days ago a friend of mine posted a picture of another guy with tattoos staring at a TV. I don have as many tattoos as him, but I thought I was looking at a picture of me for a minute. My friend wrote "Vorpalglorp, is that you?" and I had to admit I was confused. 
As a Catholic also, I lost my faith when my super religious girlfriend of two years broke up with me, banged a guy she known for a month, then told me she never loved me in order to make herself feel better about what she did. We never even had sex, because we thought we had to wait until we were married.

Inside the deep, hot bath, she washed me all over and gave me a token neck and shoulders massage, but it was brief and weak. Still, the bathtime experience is very nice, but don be under any illusions that you will get a proper massage service.7/10.

The oscillations make your body feel like it weighs more like when you're in an elevator and it quickly rises creating a greater gravitational force and therefore more work for the muscles, Coelho says. Although the machine only raises you 10mm, it increases the gravitational force by about 3  Gs, Coelho says. So any weight you carry on the Zaaz will feel 3  times heavier.

Uhhhhhh first of all you might want to work on your spins. That will take a while, so set that aside for a bit. What I reccomend is that you have a section where all drillers march into a circle and get on one knee. Have the strongest spinners on either side of the circle looking at each other. Have all drill members start tapping their rifles on the ground, as the 2 spinners get up and spin lefts while marching towards each other. Up to you to choose what to do from there.

Sehr oft sind Aromen in Ethanol gelst und verflchtigen sich whrend des Produktionsprozesses, so dass vom Ethanol nichts im Produkt brig bleibt. Wrde es sich um synthetischen Ethanol handeln, wre das fr eine Halal Zertifizierung kein Problem. Bei natrlichem Ethanol hingegen wrde auch der Rest des Aromas "verunreinigt" werden, so dass es nicht verwendet werden drfte. Bedauerlicherweise schreibt das deutsche Lebensmittelrecht allerdings vor, dass Aromen nur in natrlichem Ethanol   und nicht in synthetischem Ethanol   gelst sein drfen.

This piece works to provide a higher level of weight to the chip that it is inserted in. You will not typically find these in All Clay Poker Chips, as the clay used is the highest quality. However, you may find these in the cheaper Clay Poker Chips on the market.
OP is to focus on innermost circle every day and enlist husband help in these tasks. For all other circles, schedule times to work on them, but try not to stress about them every single day. If at all possible, do some delegating. Can the husband, who is not working right now, and maybe would benefit from some daily tasks, keep a running tally of the online business needs, do text convos with OP parents to check in? Can the kids do some simple stuff around the house to make it feel a little more airy and a little less messy, which might help OP to feel calmer and help the husband to feel less anxious? Can the kids start up some pasta for dinner on Tuesdays and Thursdays?

I get it, taxes are typically politically unpopular because it "feels bad" regardless of the good the taxes may achieve, but I believe we have to make significant changes in our daily lives from the top down if we want to avoid a dystopian future of even more severe and frequent superstorms. A gas tax is vital to this end and doesn't target rich or poor but is "fair" because of the fact it effects everyone.
Ofc, we had an argument about this yesterday. I said that what they were doing to each other were making both to feel worse and that they should probably chose another approach to the problem. She was angry at first and resistant to accept what I said, kept saying things like "it easy for you to say, you don have a depressive friend" but after a 2 hour long talk she admitted that there was some truth in what I was saying, which was a great result given how stubborn she can be. Problem is, I know her and her friend, this cycle won end until my fiancee decides to, however she afraid that whatever she says might induce her friend to kill herself, so she calculates every action and word and sentence, which then contributes to the vicious cycle. Like, this is the biggest pressure I can imagine, having to worry that your smallest actions will get someone killed and it doesn feel right that she has to just live with that and try her best. But on the other hand I don know what to do, I don know what advice to give, I don know how to approach the problem or what is the solution. From what my fiancee tells me, it clear to me (although I an ignorant in this subject) she (the friend) needs to see a psychiatrist but she gets offended when anyone brings the idea up. She sees a psychologist once a month or w/e and believes that the sessions are helping.

TNG is great, the first two seasons were a bit cheesy but it really picked up with season 3. Tied with TNG for my favorite is deep space 9. Again a rough first season, like they were trying to write TNG style episodes that sometimes worked. Once they got into a groove it got so much better. I enjoy the more politics in space between races, really helped to show a side of the federation that you hadn seen before, since before that they were the magical space communists that were the ideal society and could do no wrong. DS9 also did a lot of season long arcs for characters, and the characters really grew along with the show. Especially Nog, who goes from ferengi child to a competent star fleet officer. It also has a fantastic Mr. Garak and Quark, and one of the best star trek villains in Dukat. It was all great until the last seasons when they went in hard with the "Captain Sisko is space jesus" turned up to 11, and turning Dukat into a saturday morning cartoon villain, but it is what it is.

4) For me, I like to always carry a sniper so I can see farther as I travel, then I like having an assault rifle in my second slot and an smg/shotgun in the third. This means as opponents get closer I wheel mouse down, and having a gun for every range is nice. I always upgrade for color, but I find the AK47 does the most damage for ARs, the Pump does the most damage for shotguns, and i like the P90 for smgs, so i prioritize those over others. I like the bolt sniper and hate the VSS (very shitty sniper). Only grab a pistol or anything gray if it the only thing you can get and upgrade immediately, Don carry two ARs, but you can pick them up because you get extra ammo. I sometimes exchange the sniper for a specialty gun, like Rubber or minigun. They sometimes seem OP against bad players but good players will kill you every time, so it depends on who you run into. Miniguns have crazy range but are easy to defend against and take forever to reload. Basically you always want a long, medium and short range weapon and 1 2 heals.

To quantify that value, consider that if someone is entitled to the maximum CPP at age 65 in 2019, they would need to have $277,075 in an RRSP earning 4 per cent per year to provide the same income to their life expectancy of age 90.

With the help of drink, poker, and a beguiling gypsy, they encounter the void within each other lives.Drink, cards, prophecy, comedy, and tragedy pervade this intriguing piece of theatre which examines identity and the way in which the seeds sown in the past have a habit of sprouting unexpectedly, whether we like it or not.The older of the play two male characters is Dave Duffy, instantly recognisable as Fair City stalwart Leo Dowling. Ahead of Last Train From Holyhead heading down the tracks to Galway, Duffy took some time to chat about his career to date and his role in Field play.

There are 4 rounds of betting. During each round everyone has three options: to call (match the current bet), raise, or fold their hand. Everyone must put the same amount into the pot, if they wish to continue to the next round of betting, or the showdown. That way, you can get the hang of the pop up buttons, how the game flows, and generally feel comfortable before moving onto the cash tables.

VA Loans require appraisals, once the new heat pump was installed, the appraiser came out and looked at the property and had 3 repairs the seller needed to make before we could close. The railing on the steps was loose and needed to be secure, the draining sprouts were draining right by the foundation of the house and needed to be replaced and the paint on the windows was peeling and bare wood was exposed. Once they were complete, the appraiser would verify everything was correct, and sign off so we could close. This is where the seller started dragging their feet. I get it they don't live in my market, but these repairs took nearly 2 weeks. Seller had to pay for all of them as well. These were repairs I was planning on making however my appraisal required them to be complete before we close. After dealing with the seller and hounding him to get this done and touching base with his property manager to expedite these repairs, they were finally done by April 20th or so. Appraised for $214k (low in my opinion but I'll take it)In the meantime, the seller had to pay for a septic and termite inspection as well.

You are 100% right. And that not what I arguing. I arguing that framing moral behavior in the context of saying that such and such thing is "bad" or "good" does an ill service of such behavior.

He, and many others as him, perpetrated atrocious, heinous, terrible acts, but now have "meaningful lives" in which they "contribute to society". Are they good now? What does that mean for their victims and their acts?

Now I can agree the tone of my first comment does come off like I attacking women for leaving men and I apologise for that but what I doing is pointing out how over the last couple decades the laws have shifted to support no fault divorce and that those laws overwhelmingly favor women over men financially and in regards to custody.

Once again as Jekyll, and filled with remorse, he destroys his work and sends money to Ivy, hoping to make amends for Hyde's behaviour. When MGM made this Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde adaptation they purchased the earlier film's screenplay and destroyed all available copies of this version from the then bankrupt Paramount to prevent unfavourable comparisons. They made some minor tweaks to character names and also toned down the earlier film to make it more in line with the Hays Code, making Ivy a more respectable barmaid, although the theme of Hyde personifying Jekyll's lust and sex drive was retained.. 
Portage doesn offer any day to day benefits, but the day to day is going to be mostly stable for any set of workflows that you have on any system. The question is more whether there are to days that you can never have because you are on certain systems, or that you avoid because it is too much of a pain to get them working on a given distro. Portage gives you significantly more power in controlling exactly what software is and can be installed on your system. For example having sane management of multiple versions of a single library via the SLOTS mechanism means that you don have to manage an adhoc system for installing libraries in a custom location just to use a piece of software that depends on an older version. While this might be considered a corollary to customizability, I think it is actually a bit deeper because it can support diversity within the same system, not just one really specific set of options.

It wasn't until I watched Karley Sciortino's Viceland show where she explored why women in New York are in the same boat, that I stopped to wonder why Australian women don't have the option of paying someone to sort us out.

Things were different back then, over 50 years ago. The most beautiful area was DOWNTOWN a casino with a giant cowboy boot on the facade, and many small hotels and hotel casinos. The famous five of those times included "The Sands." There was even a golf course. Las Vegas was a small dot in the vastness of the desert, but people still had a great desire to come to this historic city and play some money on roulette or in a poker hand. Now Las Vegas is a torrent of light seen from afar in airplanes. The hotels are huge, occupying several avenues. Each hotel is a complex where you will find everything from an aspirin to the most luxurious suit or the most expensive gem.
The problem is, this high profile athletes (Football and Basketball stars) don fall in this category (traditionally.) They spend more time traveling and practicing, make more money for the university, and graduate at a lower rate than other sports. So when you say "student athletes, the NCAA is able to respond with, "AKSHUALLY Student athletes graduate at a higher rate and higher GPA than regular students and are getting scholarship so blah." But the athletes who bring in all the money, don graduate at as high of a rate and don make as good of grades. That where the disconnect is between the public and the NCAA. They try to treat all sports and athletes the same, even though they are obviously not.

Time shifting and rampant commercial avoidance have wreaked havoc on the hoary ad supported TV model, and while C3 and the enhanced C7 metric have helped a handful of already high rated shows win back a good deal of impressions that would otherwise be lost to the predations of the DVR, the currency hasn't had much of an impact on the business as a whole. And as ad skipping continues to accelerate, what was originally designed as a stopgap measure is proving no more efficient than holding up a tiny sign that reads "Eep!" right before gravity sends the cartoon coyote careening to the canyon floor.

Assume we are playing heads up poker. Given every decision in poker can be defined mathematically, GTO strategy is achieved when every decision you make is either breakeven or +EV. This means that your opponent can only breakeven against this strategy and cannot make a different decision that will allow their play to be +EV, only breakeven (or  EV.) At this point, we reach Nash Equilibrium..

The only reason I watched BIG in the first place is because it was marketed as a family classic by countless people, including Common Sense. In this case, everyone got that wrong. This is a stupid, low quality, somewhat perverted movie about a 13 year old who grows up after wishing on a crummy carnival machine. There your plot. What Common Sense doesn tell you is that this kid (Josh), has sex at age 13 with a woman who is probably in her 30s. Even though Josh looks like an adult, he still has the maturity of a 13 year old, and the whole romance part of the plot struck me as twisted and innapropriate. Even when it is revealed that Josh is only 13, the woman who is slept with seems to have no problem with it. In addition, kids say the "f" word, "st", "dn", and take the Lord name in vain frequently. Lastly, the movie is poorly made, with a strange lead performance (Hanks acts like he 5, not 13), a terrible script, and poor direction. Keep this movie away from your family and yourself. she got me one for boston round my bday in case EYE can come.

In April, I observed my grandfather first death anniversary. Daada moved to Hyderbabad, Sindh, from Buland Shehr, Uttar Pardesh, in August 1947. My father grew up in the heart of Hyderabad, in as idyllic a childhood as I ever had described to me. My maternal grandfather, my naana, known to family and friends as Babu Jee, passed away in 1983. He moved to Pakistan in 1970 from a town in UP named Gulaothi. I had the privilege of visiting Babu Jee grave at Yaseenabad in Karachi this Eid, after more than a decade. His port of landing in Pakistan was Bahawalpur, though he settled in Karachi Dastagir neighbourhood. Many smaller parts of the larger extended family, on both my mother and father sides settled across the country in Sargodha, in Tando Allahyar, in Mirpur Khas, and across southern Punjab, including Bahawalpur, Multan and Rahimyar Khan.
When people say the prime minister is apolitical, they usually mean he is weak at political management. This is a wide term and one of its critical functions is management of cabinet colleagues, all of whom are wily even if individually each has an IQ a fraction of P Chidambaram (actually, I have never measured his IQ, but surely it is stratospheric). Also, not all of them belong to the Congress party; and we all know what charlatans the regional MPs are. So the prime minister, instead of controlling these grown ups or coaxing them into policy decisions or ensuring they keep their hands out of the till, pretty much leaves everybody to his or her own device. You can blame him; it isn something he ever did and it unlikely a septuagenarian like him was going to learn to deal with each and every character Indian polity has to offer. Trying to keep Cabinet colleagues on a tight leash would have proved futile and failure in direct confrontation would have diminished him, possibly ending his tenure far too early. And anyway, party President Sonia Gandhi was always there to kick butt if the need arose.

When several individuals have similar dreams on the same night, it suggests that they are deeply interested, committed or concerned with the same issue, event or topic, such as social action or a sport. .

Examples of hegemonic ideas in American culture are things like "anyone can make it if they work hard" or "the law is objective" or "objectivity is possible." But even hegemonic ideas get brought into question in times of crisis. Perhaps the 1970s and 80s were that crisis.
