Mary started her Canada Pension Plan contributions at age 31. By age 65, she will have qualified for about 73 per cent of the 2019 $13,855 CPP maximum, $10,114 per year. Ralph, who lived abroad for many years, should be entitled to about 65 per cent of the maximum, which works out to about $9,005 annually based on what will be 25 years of work following his advanced degrees. Mary can expect Old Age Security benefits of $6,856 per year based on 38 years of residence in Canada after age 18. Ralph can expect $4,700 per year from OAS based on his residence in Canada. All that, plus Mary RRSP and Ralph company pension, adds up to $102,143 when both are 65.

No girl thinks about this consciously, or may not even notice it consciously, but we do subconsciously. So then you get these stupid games that are reinforced by other women, despite men very clearly disliking it. The problem is, we might assume you're the same. It's so hammered into us that people don't mean what they say that many women can't really accept a blunt answer because it's so simple. It's like doing long division math your entire life, thinking everyone else does it, and see someone doing short division. It's confusing because it was the only way you knew how to do it, so they must not be finished, right?

Your videos tend to focus on "how to play poker correctly", usually meaning the optimal balance of bluffs and value bets so your opponent can exploit you. A lot of the really interesting shit you said is in which hands to use in which ranges and getting into the details of what those optimal ranges look like. I understand one of the reasons to have this approach in Poker Hands is because it helps make the analysis more broadly applicable, rather than just super specific to the opponents in the actual hand.

Germans over use "until" a lot in English, using it in contexts where a native English speaker would use "by" or "to". Other than the German style commas in their written English, this is one of the biggest clues to me that something is written by a German. They also tend to either over  or under use the present perfect, in my experience, but that a bit more subjective to assess, since the two can often be substituted with only minor differences in English. I think French speakers (and speakers of other languages with a pass compos) also have similar trouble with the perfect in English, but I have more experience with Germans. I sure there are a variety of other common mistakes that Germans in particular make, but these are the ones that have stuck out to me the most.

The Middle Stages are usually ushered in by the big difference between the biggest stacks and the smallest ones especially after the first or two hours. At this stage, the stack size turns out to be the most important thing in influencing what hands a player can play against which opponents. Consequently, a player must understand that both the extra large stack and the extra small stacks are more likely to call for their bets. This is because the large stack will have fewer consequences and small stacks will get a player desperate. Hence, it is wise to play pots in position against medium sized stacks since it makes a player comfortable not to engage in large pots without having a very strong hand.

This is because expected payoffs are ALWAYS different and it will never be proper to utilise pure randomisation. A good example of this is in tennis serves, where the direction of shot has to be randomly distributed in order to skew the expected payoff of returning. Djokovic does this very well. One shot games where there is prior information of estimation leads to more randomisation as the opponent will know you know their tendencies and therefore will throw something different. Although this always falls flat in the long run as randomisation will become the norm. A good example of this is Fnatic who used to utilise their plays around the baron always catching the opponent off guard. But as we saw Misfits dismantle that tactic by recognising the permanent threat and predictability. Anyway this is a good discussion and thank you for explaining the relation to poker and chess (who use randomisation and strategic risk taking to beat even super computer level calculation).

He would open with $25 every single hand. Once the flop came he would shove. I had a stack of around $600 and called him and he shows Q,3 to my A,K. Flop was Q,3,A turn and river were junk. I realized then that some players just don care. He is there to gamble, not play poker if that makes sense. He built his stack to around $250 thanks to my call and another players call/fold. Then his play turned comical. Preflop raises of $30 50. He got caught a few times with junk and lost and his stack went down to $20 and he pulled up and walked out.

The market does not solve everything.

Some of these quotes conflict, and that doesn mean we should discount them; it means we should take into consideration that everyone has different time horizons, goals, and risk tolerances when it comes to investing. Also, it shows that even the best investors need to maintain a sense of uncertainty when investing because even the best investment decisions can result in losses. A healthy sense of skepticism towards your investing ideas can help you spot weaknesses in your thinking, so unforeseen risk doesn blindside your investments.. 
The second reason I think LSD is an excellent tool for growth is in its amazing ability to draw out emotions. People on LSD are remarkably accurate at guessing others' emotions, and are very in tune with their own. This helps trippers forge bonds and bridge gaps that the sober brain might not.

It actually not unreasonable to claim a dose that low would have some sort of an effect, maybe not with LSD but certainly with other drugs that act on HT2a. Look at Charles Nichols (yup, David Nichols son) studies on the anti inflammatory effects of DOI in vivo. They have demonstrated potent anti TNF effects in rats at far below the cognitive/CNS effects that recreational users associate with the drugs. There are ongoing studies to test as an athesma treatment in humans and patents filed. Also look at the FDA approved drug lorcaserin, which is a psychedelic acting on the HT2c receptors, the ones in question for causing heart problems. As long as the patients take the medicinally active amount far below threashold CNS effects, there nothing "psychedelic" about it unless you "OD" in which case you have an uncomfortable trip.

In the kindest and most non judgmental way possible, I'm detecting entitlement, forced integration, and the invasion of traditionally male spaces. I understand that we are in the 21st century and as a result forward progress is necessary. Modern women consistently speak about safe spaces for females. When men speak about safe spaces for males, they are often met with the response of, "the world is a safe space for men, the patriarchy ensures your safety, etc.". What about our boys who don't always have the same physical and societal assurances as men ? Why cannot these organizations retain those traditionally male and female spaces, without subjecting the boys and girls under their care to sexist and stereotypical activities ? Why doesn't the Girl Scouts organization just replicate the Boy Scouts curriculum and activities, rather than keeping the Girl Scouts organization and title, and forcing entry into a traditionally male space, and reject the proposed gender neutral name change ?

Hand 5: I honestly thought about checking this back on the river; on the turn I was hoping he had A5 or A4 so I didn't think the river was too great for us.

What are his check raise bluffs? I think he could have a lot here. That flop hits his range much harder than yours. Depending on villain style of play he could have suited 9x w/ Backdoor Flush trying to fold out any two overs while still having a lot of good turns to barrel. Or, a 5 with a pair or backdoor flush draw. When he check raises to that sizing he probably does not have a very merged range. So, by firing a pot sized bet on the turn he is representing the nuts and some percentage of sets. Why would he be trying to barrel money in the middle on the turn with only the nuts in his value range? I mean the sizing is pretty sick because if you call the turn the SPR on the river is so low you are calling with anything, which means you are folding the turn a higher %, BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT YOU TO FOLD THERE WITH THE NUTS????

The problem is that determining "damage" is very, very, VERY difficult for an objective court unless they can see an actual monetary value attached to it, and so if he wants to sue he need to attach a monetary value somehow.

Popper later said in his collection Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (Harper and Row 1963) that "Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them."

Last, but not least, be certain to pay close attention to the edges of the poker chips that you are considering. It is important and absolutely essential to ensure that the edges are in good condition and that they are not marked in any way.

I talked with some of the guys at CMU, and they were hesitant to even take on 3 handed games. The problem in those games, is that you can play a GTO strategy, and lose.

I don think so. I had a friend from China in his twenties, who knew I lived in Japan, ask if it was true they make blue films there.

Also, make sure to recognize the difference between procrastination and lack of discipline in your music vs being creatively empty. If you can sit down, and play/compose/produce/jam/dowhateveryoudo but find it uninspiring and irritating, stop! Once you proven to yourself that you have the discipline to actually work, finding it like this means you are creatively zero Working like this results in frustration, and sucks. Do something to boost that creativity like getting outside your musical comfort zone, going to a show, watching an inspiring film, listening to the music that inspired you the most, spending time with friends, or working on other hobbies. Creativity can be improved, but only in how we learn to access it and store it.

Continuing the above example, you call the bet on the flop, increasing the pot to $10. The turn card is 8, which does not improve your hand. You still have the same number of outs, 14, but one less unseen card, 46. Notice that your pot odds are almost the same, roughly 2.3 to 1. The first player bets $2, making the pot $12, and the other two players fold. The bet you must now call is $2 into a $12 dollar pot. This reduces down to 6 to 1 odds (12 divided by 2 equals 6, and 2 divided by 2 equals 1). Once again the correct play is to call. Notice that at this time, if you don't improve on the river, you can fold, and if you do improve, you can bet or raise.

A quarter through the stem is usually enough reclaim to put me at a 9 to 11 for about 8 hours.

My husband and I have been practicing tantric sex for years. That's not as weird as it might sound. Basically, for us, it's just connective sex, sensual, being present, setting the environment with candles and music. It's not every time of course, but it's a foundation and it helps me stay in touch with my sexuality. Having had that before being a mom definitely helped, although I know it would be easy to let these things go if they're not a priority. I make them a priority. I don't know about Stella but Lucy definitely got her groove back. I kind of love the maternal aspect to my sensuality that's come from being a mom.

It seems natural that a man would want to last longer during sex. Why wouldn't we be hardwired to prolong something so pleasurable? But in reality, men's sexual desires are malleable, influenced by external factors that scientists are only beginning to understand. In the survey, American men said they should last about 14 minutes, but British blokes thought 10 was plenty, and German guys figured 7 was enough. "A guy in porn can supposedly go at it for 45 minutes. That's not realistic! Even if Europeans have the same cultural references to sexuality, they have the education to break it down and realize it's not real."

I learned some infuriating information about the DOJ and Speacial Agent, who likely played with "Kat" at least as far as to try to help her maintain her unrealistic cover at Auto Trader. Yep, I being super vague here but what/who I was introduced to today blew my freaking mind! Made the "temparature of my blood" nearly kill me! I knew there was/is disgusting corruption amongst the entire DOJ system but I seriously cannot believe what I learned is NOT against the law. In order to uninvite offensive comments, which are not very common in this sub, I trying not to name places I visited today and the people who shared the information.

I suppose this particular execution of this particular type of party is rather insensitive, perhaps gauche.

Just a quick look at Wiki gives a glimpse into this fact:To the point: This special time for a young girl (I was nine) is a beginning, the first sign of womanhood, a time for her to learn about how her body works and to what purposes, a time to develop a new kind of self respect, a time for modesty and solemnity and awe for her body great gift . New ideas, new feelings, new awarenesses are happening, and the young one needs to know she is not alone. A menarche party may not be a red tent, or a ritual bath given by the girl mother sisters aunts, but in my mind at least it is an attempt at welcoming, a joining together .

If everyone is very stiff, I try to find smaller groups of people. That way I can just listen. Removing the requirement to actually talk for the first conversation helps a lot. Eventually someone in the group will ask something removing the need for me to come up and start the conversation. If they don just listen and smile. First steps are still steps, no matter how small.
