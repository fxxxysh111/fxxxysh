Hillary, who I have no love for, studies political science. If I studied political science I would likely pick Saul Alinsky too for the interesting read. Choosing to do a college paper on someone means absolutely nothing. It's a relationship between two things with no real meaning. The right may call meaning because it's a convenient diabolical relationship but it doesn't mean anything. Also, it's basically typical reading material for all political science. So I am sure the right does read this too. Wherever you heard/read this friends understanding of who Saul is and relationship to the Dems left out the right readily reads it too. It's meaningless. So trump has only mild transgressions? Obstruction of Justice? Admitting on national television of obstruction of justice, campaign with ties to Russia, overriding at an unprecedented 30+ times giving security clearances to people who were denied? Calling a state of emergency, stating on national television it's not an emergency, campaign manager was working with and giving Russians election information, using Cambridge analytica to manipulate the public, the first National Security Advisor was a foreign agent. The list goes on and on. How are these two scoops of ice cream problems? Anyone of these would have. Taken out a Dem President with Republican Congress. It's sickening you can't see it even a little.

Once you have that confidence, you will be able to focus on getting a feel for what types of hands you should and shouldn't be playing.

You'll understand that it's a good idea to fold hands like AQ or AJ preflop sometimes, like when 4 people raise in front of you.

This system lets us pick an option that a majority prefers and still give more than two options which is good, because nearly all the options we put in the poll came directly from a feedback thread we ran a few weeks before the vote itself.I avoided this asking in a public thread because I didn want any to deal with any tumblr style downvote mobs or lynchings, but is there a reason why Pokemon arts and crafts aren their own sub? I mentioned this in the survey thing before the vote was held, but I stated that in my opinion, the majority of threads in any sub should be discussion threads and it looked like every other Pokemon subject has that except for arts and crafts.At this point, all of the subreddit rules are supported by community votes. So the reason any one thing is allowed or not allowed is because of that! If people vote to ban all art and craft posts when we do another vote like this (which we will do regularly, to make sure the rules line up with people preferences), then we do it. For the time being, though, art and craft are quite popular on the subreddit, and we don want to ban them unless asked to do it via a vote.[M]  36 points  submitted 21 days agoTo explain this even further: of course craft is an artform! That isn why this distinction is made at all.

And, as Alex explained, there's just not that much motivation to be rigorous   not when consumers have come to expect new games to have rough edges. "Keep in mind that most QA teams are 20 to 30 people, at absolute most. When the game goes live, hundreds of thousands to millions of people are playing it. Missing a deadline can be too damaging. It's easier to just let the early buyers do the first round of testing for you."

But critics of the Abenomics strategy question whether consumers, whose purchasing power and real wages also have been declining for more than two decades, are really willing or even able to change their behavior and begin spending more. Abe was grilled by the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) Banri Kaieda in Parliament in mid April on the link between inflation and the higher wages and hiring needed to ensure that the economy takes off. Abe merely pointed to the change in atmosphere in Japan since he took over from the DPJ Yoshihiko Noda as prime minister in December.

The $1 million reserve combined with the $404,000 already in RRSPs and TFSAs (we leaving the $10,000 cash for living expenses) would give them $1,404,000 for investment.

I have an extensive justno step family. Oldest step aunt is staunchly anti gov as well, but that didn't stop her from plotting with step grandma to have CPS involved with other (deaf) step aunt when DSA's infant son fell off the bed. I was referencing things I witnessed these survivalist/prepper/Y2K bunker/hoarding guns for Armageddon anti government nuts threaten with my own eyes. Just because step aunt was anti government didn't stop her from using gov agencies to accomplish what she wanted. I couldn't believe that she would discuss this in front of my mom and me, it was the first time we'd met any of them. My take away is that warnings like that have a tendency to be them verbalizing what they want to happen.

The USA has a hard right mainstream GOP and while it might not be full on fascist, it creeps closer every election.

The few Republicans like Michigan Representative Justin Amash who have spoken against Trump's emergency declaration largely oppose executive overreach   not the border wall itself.Citing a near 40 year low for illegal border crossings, former national security officials published a statement Monday denying that there is an emergency that "entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border."Some Republican former members of Congress also published a letter Monday urging current GOP lawmakers to put the Constitution over their party loyalty by supporting the resolution.House GOP leaders are instructing members to oppose the resolution, according an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins told reporters last week she would vote for the resolution as long as no objectionable amendments are attached.

Hainan Airlines have a great striking colour base to work from and their livery on the 787 is undoubtedly for me one of the best in fact, the third best on this list. It just looks incredible; not too much colour, not too much white just perfect. The second best livery on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has to go to Royal Jordanian. Everything about it is just professional and even luxurious. The refine gold mixed in discreetly with the black really make it a pleasure to look at.

Got her the exact model she wanted, but her step mom came in and got her a blue convertible just to show her "You can always get everything you want in life." No other reason. Just didn want my mom to be too happy. My mom was still salty about it 40 years later. The red version cost the exact same as the blue version, looked just as good, and would been just as easy to buy, they just didn want her to be too happy. I know that a petty thing to be upset about, but I agree. If you going to go to all the effort of getting your kid a car, you should at least find out what color they like/don like.

Are you basing this statement on actual data? My personal experience tells me it has gotten much worse. I've been monitoring air pollution levels pretty regularly since I had my first child four years ago. Even within that relatively short period, we've gone from having a typical "yellow dust" period where pollution was particularly bad, to basically having that bad period for the entire year. I honestly don't even remember when the yellow dust period is anymore because it has become indistinguishable from the rest of the year.

Know your opponents. Everyones chances of hitting a four card open straight is twice as likely, because it has a place open at either end to complete the hand; for example, a hand of 4 5 6 7 can use either a 3 on the left end or an 8 at the other to complete the straight. But, an inside straight only has one space somewhere in the middle that must be filled to complete the hand; 4 6 7 8 needs a 5 and nothing else to become a straight (half as likely)..

At this point, there's a slight dribble of it on the ground around his boots. Still denies. MTIs say fuck this, and fall him out with dorm chief and two wingmen. We get smoked for about ten minutes, as retribution for letting him shit himself, before dorm chief and a Wingman come careening down the stairs, talking about Airman Snuffy stuffed his pants in the toilet and the brother flight dorm is flooding. Dude had a mental break and got carried out by several MTIs.

What was your favourite book growing up? Tons! I loved helping unpack the cartons of books at school from the National Library Service. Miffy was the first book I remember getting hooked on.

However, I don't know what the odds are of getting spotted in the crowd. This is not probably the sort of show where everyone performing is backstage the whole time and they have no idea who's out there. The balcony (and only the balcony) was sold out, so I assume those in the show just go up there to watch when they are done.

At the end of the day though, this is what your grandpa wanted, you know? If he wanted them to have 500k he would have split it up that way, assuming he was mentally sound n all. Things like them not even going to the funeral and having an estranged relationship definitely point to that fact they are only interested in the money, not your grandpa. 
El Potro debuted in 2006 with a location in Somerville's Union Square, and most recently opened a larger space in Malden. Each is a riot of color and filled with hand carved furniture painted with scenes of Mexico. While each serves a simple taco selection   think: pork abobada on scratch made corn tortillas   El Potro offers much more atmosphere than your typical mom and pop. A live mariachi band regularly plays, and a lively karaoke scene takes over on weekends. (156 Highland Ave., Malden; 61 Union Square, Somerville)Two bustling floors of seating, a rooftop, and cheap margaritas have made Felipe's Taqueria a student fixture in Harvard Square. But no student ID is required to enjoy its tacos, which are priced at $4.25 for two and finished with such fillings as chorizo, steak tips, and lightly battered shrimp or haddock. (21 Brattle St., Cambridge)Herrera's operates two brick and mortar locations just blocks away from the Boston Common, plus another two food carts in Downtown Crossing. That's good news for any taco lovers in that square mile, who have ample opportunities to nab a roast pork or fried codfish taco. appetites can also partake in breakfast tacos, which come loaded with scrambled eggs, refried beans, cheese, ranchero sauce, ham, homefries, and chorizo.

River is a ten. He says sheepishly "I allin". I obviously call. He turns over QT. I mean it was only a 3 outer to a win and a 2 outer to a chop, but man, it was just a huge kick to the gut due to all the negative build up to that moment. It like you thinking with all the patience and perseverance that you going to come out ahead after all the BS you had to deal with and it feels like the Poker Gods take a giant dump on you. Not a huge buy in but I remember that first place ended up getting $4k and playing cash later. It was the bubble, I had been playing relatively tight as the big stack was calling often pre, regularly shoving any top pair or big draw and I was doing well siphoning chips from other players rather than getting in big hands with him. This hand, I had AQs. I raised pre in late position and got 2 callers including the leader. Flop was KJTssx. I bet in late position and the chip leader jams folding out the other player. We flip our cards and he is visibly distraught as he shows K9o. Turn Tx, River Kx. Dealer (pretty unprofessional of her which I laughed at) says "Wow, now that a bad beat if I ever seen one.".

She says, "I thought about Pop Art and how the dominant subject matter was always the celebrity or the pop culture icon on the canvas, and then I thought to myself, But what I have tried endlessly to become through my work is a celebration of my differences through art, with myself as the canvas, as opposed to me as the subject matter, being put on the canvas.

That being said, ND has one hell of an offensive line and if Kelly had went to calling pass plays more in the first half, I think yall win.

Poker sites generate revenue from rakes. In others words, they make money from collecting a small portion from each pot in cash games and by charging an entrance fee in tournaments. The more players they have, the more rake they get. Therefore, to catch the eyes of more players, poker sites tailor special bonus offers so that players get free bonus cash as a 'thank you' for their deposits with the hope that they will continue playing at the poker room.

The Theon Cross album is hands down my AOTY so far. He plays tuba in Sons of Kemet, so if you listened to them that will give you an idea of what his playing sounds like.

Point is, there is a lot that we don't know about Lyme. It's concerning to me because research and funding is so limited. The reported cases of Lyme per year is about 30,000. The CDC and Lyme action groups estimate that the number of cases reported to the CDC are a mere 10% of total actual cases per year because research is showing that they majority of cases go undiagnosed. That puts the number of cases per yer is over 300,000. That's more than invasive breast cancer, yet the funding is a drop in the ocean in comparison.
With constant temptation and easy opportunity for favoritism and even extortion, with utter lack of supervision and control, and without the slightest preparation and training to create in the coroner mind a scientific and professional interest in the performance of his duties, the present system could not have been better devised intentionally to render improbable, if not impossible, the honest and efficient performance of the important public function entrusted to his office..

Finally, there is a possible phonological Celtic influence on Old English, that is obscured by sound changes within the British Celtic languages themselves. If one were to look solely at the surviving British Celtic languages and contemporaneous ones like Old/Middle Welsh, any phonological influence on Old English would be completely obscured due to the fact that the British Celtic languages underwent significant sound changes beginning around 500/600AD. This means that the hypothetical Lowland Celtic dialects the Anglo Saxons encountered may not even have resembled later Welsh or Cornish, making the potential influence a Celtic British language on English imperceptible if we were only to look at other British languages. However, it may be possible to identify a Celtic influence on Old English sound system through an analysis of Old Irish, of all languages. This is possible if we accept Peter Schrijver thesis that Old Irish is actually Proto Irish that only arrived in Ireland sometime around the Roman Conquest of Britain: this would explain the complete lack of dialectical variation in Old Irish and a series of dramatic sound changes between 400 600 which could be explained by the rapid adoption of Old Irish by an indigenous population who previously spoke another, possibly non Indo European, language.
