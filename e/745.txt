Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know. But I was wrong the report was a step in the correct direct, the finalization occurring the next year (and not a moment too soon for the very highly economically challenged Goodyear).

Many food experts prefer to call the tomato, the "apple of love." Why is the tomato erotic? Two reasons: First of all, the sensation of eating a fresh, fully ripened, crisp, clean, juicy tomato is sexy all on its own.

Well its just a stupid answer. Yes the rich well off people making 30$+ an hour can afford a house by themselves, but because I "only" make 20$/hr I can buy a house? Even a small cheap one?

In effect, you can "bully" the table by making big raises and re raises, and forcing other players to risk all or almost all of their chips (whereas you have a cushion because you've already accumulated extra chips). The downside, of course, is that it's easier to bust out early with this strategy. The second school of thought is more conservative and stresses simply surviving early in the tournament, and looking for advantageous opportunities later when the blinds are higher and the stakes greater.

To win the pot. I must Disagree, If you picked 100 poker players at random and asked them about the objective of poker, most would say something about winning the pot, but they couldn't be further from the truth.

In fact, you'd win every pot you possibly could. But you'd lose money. Plenty of it, and rapidly. (Full Answer)

The idea behind the play was to make the Ravens guard the slot receiver, even though he can catch the ball, then throw it to the tackle on the other side who is eligible. They used a big tight end, who looks like a lineman so that the defense wouldn notice that the tackle is actually an eligible receiver and would leave him uncovered. It worked, the defense couldn figure out who to cover in the time before the ball was snapped and left the tackle wide open.

Like nearly all of popular culture, began in the hurly burly of the Victorian age. Industrialization, the creation of a large working class in opposition to a newly powerful middle class, a new mass culture of consumption, and a system of racial and national hierarchies within an empire created the perfect climate for burlesque, a working class entertainment in which all rules could be broken for comic effect and profit. Indeed, it was exactly this "slap in the face" aspect of burlesque that made it such an important part of the growing entertainment industry.

But now with the economic upturn, casinos are back in business, especially in Macau, the former Portuguese colony on the south China coast, which was hit hard by the financial crisis.Thanks largely to Chinese gamblers, Macau, home to the world's biggest casino palace, is again witnessing the glitz, the glamour and, of course, non stop gambling.But Macau is not the only place where casinos are minting money.Here is a look at the 20 biggest casinos in the world.Restaurants and bars: 29Hotel rooms: 824Given Las Vegas' reputation as America's favourite playground, it is somewhat surprising that the gambling hub does not have the biggest casino in the US.That honour goes to Foxwoods, a complex of six casinos with 17 different types of table games, including 100 for poker.Opened in 1986 in Connecticut, it is managed by the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe, and benefits due its close proximity to New York and Boston.In addition to its casino, Foxwoods has one of the world's largest bingo halls.

Although many are likely to be outraged by the show's premise, some sexperts applaud the effort to bring body image and sexual expectations back in line with reality. "I believe that seeing real sex between consenting adults who aren't being directed by professionals is essential to a happy, healthy sex life," says Dr. Jess O'Reilly, Astroglide's resident sexologist. "Porn is not intended to be a form of education, but we often use it as a learning model, as we have no other options. If you want to learn any other new skill like football, cooking or crafting, you begin by observing others. You don't simply learn about the mechanics in a book or study the potential risks in school   you actually watch others performing the task on video or in person. Why do we treat sex differently?"
Coming back to wood barrels that are not necessarily filled with pig (or wild boar) bristles but with something else less advanced comes this manual on making wood barrels. Everything is there, everything you'd need to make a barrel (and a good one at that), and I admire this sort of fantastic dedication to what is essentially (to our modern mind) mundane except that it is as dry as well cured barrel wood. But I admire it still, as I do the Elevator pamphlet, because, well, they're done right.

When they talk high percentage, they mean something that will present frequently enough that it will end up in the news. Say there a 1% chance of blood in urine and 50,000,000 people are administered the vaccine in a one month span. The news will take an interest in 500,000 people with bloody urine. From a military perspective, you have a higher chance of getting exposed to biological weapons (small pox or anthrax for instance), and so the risk of you pissing blood for a couple of days is better than the 30% chance of you dying if you contract small pox (probably better with modern treatment) or 80% for inhaled anthrax.

No not at all. Those odds leave room for reasonable doubt. Especially with a crime scene that was compromised as badly as this one was. There is reasonable doubt that there were no bones in Avery pit. The "forensic exam" was done at the sheriff office. There are NO crime scene photos and the exuming of the bones should have been recorded. Instead you have a box of bones that could have come from anywhere stored at the sheriff office before being brought to the examiner office and looking at 2 days later. Their was no chain of command. The "evidence" should never have seen the light of a courtroom.

Idk who downvoted you, but when she visited she just made her usual excuses about why she too busy to clean up the mess in her house. I never actually met anyone in person I had something like this sort of in common with. When my mom married my step dad he owned this fixer upper house in an upscale neighborhood, but he never ended up fixing it up. From the time I was 8 until I moved in with my dad at 14, the house just slowly fell apart while we lived in it. Like there was these big holes in the kitchen, hallway, and other places that went to the basement, and I fell in several times, like legs waving around in the basement while my torso was still on the ground floor of the house and I had to pull myself out. Plus, my step dad was a low level hoarder so the house was packed with junk and piles of junk and the kitchen in general was just always a mess and everything was cluttered, so it wasnt always easy to avoid these holes. In the winter we didn have heat bc too much of it escaped. And he had a pretty good job, and always kept the exterior of the house looking nice so our neighbors wouldn know. We weren allowed to have anyone over.

Yeah, it probably theoretically a fine line to end up here with 4c5c, but it sucks to play. When UTG is a competent player and takes a line like that, you looking at a nutted range. You lead into the previous rounds aggressor who is still left to act, so UTG calling your lead with an overpair would be suicide. That pretty much leaves them with A9s, 97s, T8s, some 33 (if they open these pre), 99, some 66, and 77. 77 would be especially gut wrenching, but could make sense with a bet flop, check turn line.

I had a perfectly pleasant interaction with a stranger in a store the other day, sharing a mirror while trying on a jacket. The "old" me would be stiff and uncomfortable, likely to avoid talking to anyone I didn absolutely need to. 
But don you think it hysterical that some drug dealer who is responsible for x amount of deaths and endless pain and suffering thinks he better than a child killer? I mean, how many families are torn apart from drugs? How many children neglicted and abused? How many innocent women and children have been killed by narcos in Mexico getting the drugs to the US? The pain and suffering is incomparable to the admittedly heinous but relatively rare child killer. And what group accounts for the highest percentage of child deaths? The stats are clear: mothers.

Heavily decrease corporate tax rate, heavily increase marginal tax rate in upper brackets. If corporations aren people, they shouldn be treated as people, and that includes taxation.

An experienced player will choose to play only about 20% of the hands they are dealt, forfeiting the other 80% of the hands before even getting past the first round of betting. That means about 80% of the time is spent just watching other people play.

Good lord. But I wonder just how bad he was that they felt a need to do that, say if he could be dangerous. Or, they were just really shitty parents. I had an ex who used to spend time in the hospital. Problem is, it a mental hospital known for violent people. He was bipolar, but I heard he was also schizophrenic. THAT part he would never admit to, but he admit to bipolar and everything else. Not to mention narcissist. He could be a charmer, get you to believe anything. Including "how bad all those other women hurt him". Until he dumped me (again), and again, married the woman he took up with after me. After they split, he started stalking me. They got back together, he stopped. Then they divorced, and I had to get a security camera, because he was vandalizing my vehicles, tossing my potted plants around, and even cut my garden hose! So, I approached the recent wife/ex wife (3), and we had a lovely chat. He was physically abusive, and at one point said he cut her up and flush her down the toilet and no one would ever know. But, to read his social media, she was an evil cunt who cheated on him (he was cheating on 2 with hookers), she was secretive, and abusive. She told me to go to the cops, because he was DANGEROUS. Of course, not much they could do unless I caught him on camera, but by that time, he had a massive stroke. Then a couple years ago, he went to take a nap on the sofa, his mom came to check on him, and he was gone. Died in his sleep. Blessing for him, and us.
"Every home has its own signature scent," Brashear says, noting that air is a complex combination of all odor molecules, like laundry and hair care products, lotion, cooking smells, or pet odors, stinky shoes and other undesirable scents. She says that the odor cycle affects every home, since there's usually nowhere for those scent molecules to go, especially when the house is closed up during the cold and hot weather months. So, when scent molecules get released into the air they move throughout the home, then they settle into the couch, carpet, drapes, etc. "Then, as soon as somebody plops down on the couch or there's a spike in humidity those molecules get re released into the air," she says. And while many of us make it a priority to regularly clean closets, baseboards and bathrooms, she recommends truly cleaning the air with products that trap odor molecules and eliminate them rather than simply masking them. "Air makes up more than 75 percent of the space in your home and it's really important and often neglected."

This is what many downtown councillors fail to understand, and why council is so often deadlocked on big issues such as jobs, housing and transit. They haven taken the time to understand what our daily experience is like in the inner suburbs, and haven come up with alternative solutions that carry concrete benefits for our communities. Yet when an idea like the Woodbine casino comes along, flawed yet full of potential, they very eager to tell us why it will fail.

Give me a break, "cheaper form of slavery"? Most slaves were provided with little more than a wooden shack and the ability to grow their on food to survive. Comparing that to a system that pays skilled, voluntary laborers with a competitive wage established by market values, health insurance benefits, retirement fund matches, paid vacation, life insurance, and a myriad of other forms of compensation to slavery is ignorant and insensitive to those who suffered under slavery.

Man I wish I was white and rich and had a white republican appointed entitled piece of shit judge sentence me. I mean even though Paul Manafort probably didnt collude or do anything treasonous, he did indeed facilitate it. He enabled a foreign adversary the ability to covertly and psychologically influence our election, which probably lead us to what will probably be remembered as the gilded age of the new millennium. Plus he didn't pay taxes. So all in all I can see how 4 years instead of 19 is fair. Especially when he was convicted of just 8/18 charges (10/18 of which he did eventually admit of being guilty to but wasn't charged w because of 1 dumb fuck trump groupie who lacks the basic skills to realize trump and those around him are rich, white, republican, entitled, sleaze playing normal people off their differences and insecurities). the man is blameless I tell you! Just ask all the witnesses he tampered with and his blatant cover ups and lies!

If either of the "dealer button" position cards are exposed the dealer keeps going, after all the players have received two cards, the exposed card is retrieved, the deck is placed face down on the table, the deck is cut in at least 9 cards, the "dealer button" position gets the next card. The exposed card goes into the muck. ..

After making a choice, you pay at a counter and then take an elevator up to the 2nd, 3rd or 4th floor and then to the room. Some people complain about the rooms in Nataree, and sure, they could do with a lick of paint, but they are a good size, well lit, with a deep bathtub for two, a big and comfortable bed, and have two mirrors.

If you folded on a round, there might be a good chance you would want to talk about the possibilities that could happen if you stayed in the game, and you would want to do this while the game is still on. Do not do this as the other players can use this information to win their current hand. 
It makes sense to not air it, as it potentially would be a waste of their viewership time.

Humans aren't stupid, we're the modern day descendent victims of people who ruthlessly exploited their environments because of "progress". Any who stood in the way of that got shoved out the world over, from the Khoisan in Southern Africa (lol, you don't think they're giving the land stolen from white farmers to the Khoisan blacks, do people think that? It's all the Bantu blacks who get it. They're the group of Africans who has been systematically pushing out others for thousands of years now, and they started in far west Africa).

Nina Bo'Nina is a legend, and a fierce performer!

However, if there is even a little bit of an interest in going out and seeing her, I do recommend it! :) Also, we're always here for you to offer our emotional support! Whatever choice you make, I hope you enjoy it! Let us know what happens? :)
This statement directly indicates that either Gaetz intends to ask Cohen about his marital infidelities at the hearing, or has knowledge of fellow Congressmen who intend the same. The logical implication is that if Michael Cohen declined to testify or otherwise appear for the hearing, he would not be asked about his marital infidelities. In this case, a reasonable recipient would interpret it as a threat. Simply ask yourself, if told you that I would publicly release information that you had been cheating on your wife if you testified against me, would you interpret that as a threat? It has the obvious quid pro quo of a threat   if you do this, I won do that. Therefore, the first element of the offense has clearly been met.
The first item on this list isn't something you eat, it's about the feel of the cornstarch on your body (half  to full nude body preferred). Just the initial sensation of cornstarch dropping on the skin mimics the sensation of liquid silk. Try a few drops on yourself and you'll see what I mean.

Shame on you. That not what i was saying and that not what it (statement of Cohen sincerity on a posterboard from the Southern District of NY) says. 
Exactly! Someone local to me posted on Facebook whining about a dishonest Car Dealer who refused to give back his deposit and sold said vehicle to another purchaser. At 1st I believed him and said "Take them to Small Claims Court." Then I saw other evidence, another user posted a snapshot of texts from the Car Dealer stating the guy did NOT follow through with producing pay stubs proving his income to secure financing so they sold the vehicle (after holding it for an unspecified amount of time) and refunded him 1/2 the deposit. The original poster refused to answer 2 questions about how long the Dealer did hold the car waiting for him to provide proof of income. I posted it sounded like he breached the verbal contract by not providing proof of income to make financing happen and he blocked me from his post! How dare I state a valid argument! All he wanted was people to be on his side.

It is true that with the advent of online poker, more and more people are learning to play poker, and as such it behooves the new player to learn as much online poker strategy as they can. This will not only give them an advantage over the other poker players who dont use any type of strategy to play, but it also gives you a better starting position, as you will be ready for any contingency. The main trick to winning at online poker, or indeed any type of poker, is practice and experience.

With the Siting Program Study now narrowed to a field of two potential tracts in Washington County and the tract near Point of Rocks, the Sugarloaf citizens got their first formal presentation of the plans and the site search and the chance to express disbelief that the vista from Sugarloaf may be marred by an additional plant to the PEPCO facility at Dickerson.

These amounts may seem like large numbers, but the fact is that even consistent winning professional poker players have downswings in their bankroll that may sometimes reach 200 times the big bet of the limits at which they are playing. Any number of factors or a combination of factors may cause these downswings. They include a run of bad cards, poor play for one reason or another, poor game or table selection, or health issues.

It is difficult not to mourn the end of a relatively open border. Yesterday, as my daughters and I drove up to Montreal for our usual dim sum, I could not find their passports. No problem, of course, since I had birth certificates. As we drove back last night, the border guard waived us through without even glancing at their documents. He seemed friendly and unconcerned about the sesame balls in the back seat. As of today, that friendliness will be more difficult to enact. We can no longer pretend that Vermont is a part of Quebec or that Canada is the 51st state of the United States.

I understand the need for the data and the research, but, still, it is a tough go, and no doubt a lot of unusual bits could be forced from the title. the paper: "Abstract Real and simulated particulate fallout and solutions of Sr85CL2 and Cs134Cl2 fed to 102 healthy volunteers. Absorption and retention of ingested radioactivity was measured by whole body counting using the gamma ray spectrometer at the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital. An average of 3 per cent of the radioactivity of week old local fallout WS absorbed: the range was 0 9 per cent. Strontium and cesium leached or dissolved from simulated fallout behaved in the same way, metabolically, after absorption as they did when the tracer was swallowed in a solution or injected intravenously. The large number of subjects studied provided additional information on the range of variation of intestinal motility, biological availability of strontium, cesium and barium following ingestion of fallout, and retention of the radionuclides of these elements."Interesting set of descriptors used by the Defense Technical Information Center:JF Ptak Science Books Post 2687

I concur! There are so many situations out there where a spouse feels like they MUST take further measures to ease their mind and help themselves. One may suspect their spouse is a drug addict and it would have continued on that way if they did not snoop or do further investigating. Or, a spouse is doing something illegal and the other spouse reports them to the law.

He talks like his 3x bet with AA and KK was this genius play or his call with AQhh on a KJ9hhx board was amazing. These pots are surely worth a recall, but the analysis/story he puts into them is a bit over the top for me.

I hear your theory, but I don think it has anything to do with poor whites having actual firsthand experience with blacks. They very rarely coexist outside or rural areas in the South. I think they have no experience with blacks at all, and so they just choose to believe what everybody around them says. The cure for racism is a passport, and it their isolation that perpetuates their own fears. Black people have absolutely nothing to do with that, so stop trying to suggest black people scared off all the poor white folk.

Thank you. I mean before these 2 my childhood dogs were brother and sister and had been together since birth. At 13, one got hip dysplasia and we had to put her down. The boy who was always the one who never did anything wrong, somehow managed to get out for the first time and got hit by a car within a week. We think he was out looking for her. So I guess it is fairly common with bonded pairs, I just can scientifically make sense of it in my head and I keep searching for a reason, or something I must have done wrong to prompt it so quickly. But you are right, sometimes it just happens, and it is for the best. In the two days he was without her he was very sad and kept looking for her waiting by the door. So glad they can be together again.

Not at all, but I was always oblivious to the clandestine actions and subsequent rumours in my high school. The porn star I went to school with was Khalifa I simply knew her as Sarah/Sara (Not sure the spelling, never bothered to learn it). I knew her for a relatively short period of time, it was her senior and my sophomore year of high school when we first met. Additionally, I not sure if she actually completed the year as to my knowledge she was constantly getting in to trouble for various reasons I can not substantiate. The school was a military academy, therefore, it was easy to find yourself in trouble and most the students had pre existing issues with discipline. Yet to warrant dismissal I suspect her transgressions had to be serial or egregious. However, as she was the first person to talk to me on my first day at that school, I will always remember her as a very nice girl. In retrospect, with what I had learnt/realised once everybody knew she was in the porn industry, it understandable if someone might have seen it coming.

The fact that the GOP continuously misuses its base of misinformed, rural white folks is not surprising.

Of course, GOP leaders like populist manipulator McCain would find being burned in effigy at a town meeting "offensive" and "unAmerican."

Beijing is an awesome city. I can't emphasize that enough. The wealth of cultural, historical, artistic, and economic opportunities there is phenomenal. There's no better music or arts scene anywhere in China. I met so many cool, smart, funny, and talented people when I lived there   Chinese and foreign alike. And I was making bank. Beijing is expensive, sure, but rents are still affordable if you look around. I lived by myself in a studio apartment 30 minutes from work, ate out most days per week, had plenty of fun and traveled a lot, and I still ended up saving about $15,000 my first year, and much more than that my second. It's pretty easy to pick up a private tutoring or corporate training class or two each week that'll sneak a nice stack of RMB into your pocket each month. Yes, it's technically illegal, but if you're doing a lesson at a student's home, office, or at a cafe, your risk approaches zero. I was teaching adults full time (which I highly recommend over teaching kids, way more chill and easy to make friends), and doing one or two one on one or company training classes each week in the morning before work. Or you could not do that   I definitely earned enough just from my regular job to live comfortably and save.

The odd thing was that one of the claimants to the imperial throne, who was generally recognised to be the true inheritor, ended up in the SF Bay Area where I grew up.

But you know, he had grown up as a child playing with the young tsarevich, may have known my nana. When I found all that out via his obituary, it was like a layer of history that is so often invisible: how history tosses us around like pieces of driftwood.

Here a talk she gave that gives a fairly detailed overview about the types of things she claiming. Very eye opening stuff. She was one of the major catalysts for the attention given to the trillions missing from the Pentagon right before 9/11. Speaks about the Oklahoma bombing happening right before they were going to get records from that building in order to audit. Talks about black budget, secret space programs, UFO programs and how they are funding a breakaway civilization, how departments like HUD (the department she ran) are literally just slush funds for this and how the financial records (or lack thereof) highly support the idea. She was very high up on wall st. as well as being in charge of government programs, coined and came up with the popular "Popsicle index" used to gauge quality of life, etc. Doesn get much more credible than this.

Where are these places with so many options? I don like in some rural, backwoods town. I live in a fairly large, suburban Massachusetts town and we have one choice for ISP which is Comcast. For cable companies, Mass is split between Comcast and Charter, with some towns having Charter and some having Comcast, but even then you can pick which cable company you want. You have to deal with whatever cable company works in your town. We don even have FiOS installed in half of the state and the majority of an entire county still only has dial up internet. Every city/town in Mass has a cable TV provider and you either pick cable internet through that company or if you lucky enough to be near Boston, some cities/towns out there have FiOS. I guess you could count dial up as an "option" but that a joke and DSL isn much better for the areas that have it. So I guess we technically have 3 "options" for internet. What other options are out there that I missing? How are there up to 7 options for ISPs? I not trying to be sarcastic or a jerk, I genuinely curious as how other places can have so many options and why our options are so limited.

Of course we can say that the first scenario is an easier path. Does that mean we won get bounced by the Ducks in the first round?

It seems that this is an actual battle scene, which was a very uncommon thing among war photographs for the Great War more so for this group of photographs (News Photo Service) produced by pool photographers for equal distribution among subscribing newspapers and periodicals. Actual combat photos distributed by the News Photo Service agencies were not a high priority, unless they depicted routed or retreating or being defeated Germans it was not a popularly distributed subject, mainly for propagandist purposes.
