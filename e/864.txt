Arizonan here. This state is abohrenlty pro business, and screws workers all the time. For instance, if you injured on the job, the first thing they do is turn the claim over to a private company. That company will inundate you with paperwork. The first demand is TEN YEARS medical and mental health records. And, if the injured employee manages that, the second step is denial, without any type of review. Then the injured person has to file a dispute. Arizona is heavily anti employee. Many companies have rights, like landlords, and tenants rarely get a far shake in this state.

Despite her protestations that the hippie country chic vibe was "who I am right now," as she told Harper's Bazaar, and the stylistic choice to pay tribute to Elvis Presley in the music video for the album's title track and most of her promotional appearances, the attempt to get country music fans (or even her once devoted pop fan base) to say they loved her back never gained much traction.

For how the murders/etc work, I was kind of thinking something similar to Robinson Crusoe event cards, where you are forced to accomplish something or bad things happen. The example for this game would be the killer/cops playing these against each other. So maybe the cops are closing in on his identity, and if he doesn change his disguise (just making things up) in X rounds, they catch him. The killer, on the other hand, could play cards that give him and advantage but offer the cops clues if they can satisfy the card (not sure how that would work, I have ideas though).

It the people who go to "college" that don get jobs. The fact is a lot of businesses are started by idiots who have a half assed plan for a get rich quick scheme or are blinded by their passion and aren objective.

Athletes have fairly stable plaques instead of the unstable mix of calcium and lipids seen in unhealthy people, and stable plaques don rupture as easily and cause heart attacks.In the case of endurance athletes, the hardening and thickening of arteries is most likely a natural process and not really a "disease."Interestingly though they categorized them as either 3000+METmin/wk or less than 1500METmin/wk so if I understand that correctly it means high activity (not necessarily endurance athletes just self reported as highly active) versus not so active (including all the way down to no exercise per week).

My daughter started to semi consistently sleep through the night at 22 months, but even that was only a few nights a week. When she woke up at night she would consistently be awake for 2 hours and if I wasn in with her she would lose it. She also wouldn go to sleep at night until 9 pm and needed someone to be in with her until she fell asleep.

Neuroskeptic rightly points out a major flaw in the 2012 study, namely, the classification of "expert" players was based on self reports. I would argue further that playing a mere 60 or 1000 hands of poker is an insufficient sample size, given the statistical complexities of the game. There are 52 cards, with more than 2.5 million possible five card combinations. Texas Hold 'Em uses seven cards so there are around 133 million combinations. Plus, you know, fixing the deals really messes with those probabilities.

So, to play $1/$2 in a casino, that a $200 buy in. You need 30 buy ins before you can even have a seat or play a hand. That $6,000 MINIMUM. When you said you recently went busto, you were playing $200NL with far less than $6,000, more like 2 to 3 hundred. That completely unacceptable.

Variance mostly comes from playing a not completely gto and not playing enough. Once you play GTO eventually variance becomes a lot less. Certain games have more variance than others a hundred percent but most variance is about bad play while running bad.

That does not mean your $277,075 CPP has increased in value by 10.4 per cent if you defer for a year, just that your subsequent payments would increase by that amount. In order to quantify it, an RRSP would need to earn an even higher 4.57 per cent annually from age 65 to age 90 instead of just 4 per cent to provide the same retirement income as a CPP pension deferred to age 70. For a conservative investor, or someone who figures they may well live to 100 and earn an even higher on deferring, CPP deferral can be better than a lot of RRSP investment options.

Adding good players, to me, should always improve your team. Year, only four teams (Buffalo, Columbus, Toronto and Winnipeg) parted with a first round pick prior to the trade deadline. 
When players make mistakes because something upsets them emotionally, it is called a "tilt" or "being on a tilt." An example is a player who is a huge favorite in a hand but loses to an opponent who hits a miracle card (often called a "bad beat"). That player becomes so emotionally upset that he/she begins to make bad decisions.

When my children ask me how someone as smart and as good as Obama could be doing these things, I answer that he is not in charge. Politicians exist to get re elected and getting re elected requires contributions from big business and big military.

Do not build NPCs as full characters, just design them as dicepools (of STAT + SKILL + CIRCUMSTANCE). 4 to 6 is normal for standard people, 8 to 10 is good, 12 or even 14+ becomes exceptional, the best characters should have 18ish dice, but do note that be a threat to the characters.Focus on story and theme for a start, that is where Shadowrun is strong.

A place that i used to play at under a freakin perkins (basically) got raided a month or so after i moved out of the city for college. it was such an innocent game  25% of the player pool was old ladies, ffs. it was just a bunch of middle aged blue collar guys wanting to play some fucking cards, man. the owners of the restaurant i assuming knew of it, had a server go around and serve drinks, had roughly 80 100 players per $30 tourney with $20 SnG and $0.50 $1.00NL cash games for those that went busto. the guy who ran the game claimed he only took enough rake so he could play for free (so $30, but who knows if that how he actually did it  maybe one of you sharper r/poker guys can do the math real quick  80 players, $30 buy in, first was always $900, second $400ish, third i think $300ish, fourth $100ish and fifth got their money back) and was named "steve" but everyone had to call him "alonzo," as if that would really make a difference, safety wise (that and half of his friends would fuck up and call him steve on accident anyways). sometimes the cash games would go to bar time and have to move to the bar next door. good times.

Now, if one were to multiply 375g by the 7.53billion people on this planet, one would get 2.82 trillion grams of soy per day (and that modestly rounding down to the nearest hundredth of a trillion). That 2.82 billion kg per day, or 6.22billion lbs per day. Multiply that by 365 days and you get a little over one trillion kg per year or 1.01 billion tons. Comparatively, the world currently only produces 352 million tons of soy per year. Divide 1.01 billion tons by 352 million tons, and you will see that the current production of soy would have to increase nearly three fold to sustain the necessary protein intake of every human on the planet (2.7, to be exact). So no, veganism would make the industrial farming of soy and its devastating effects on the environment much, much worse.

There is a historical explanation for why Brisbane's city streets are so narrow! When Queensland became a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859, it did so with very little public money. A consequence of this was that the early CBD was developed mostly by private investors. The CBD was designed using Melbourne's Hoddle Grid as a basis, with some alterations (including the removal of 'little streets' which were not popular in Melbourne at the time. They were thought to associated with crime and poverty, because they often had cheaper rent and therefore 'lowlier' citizens, and they were also thought to encourage disease. Medicine at this time had a miasmic theory of disease, which suggested that disease was caused by bad gases that got trapped in cramped spaces like little streets). One alteration was that the streets were made narrower. The Hoddle Grid was designed to meet regulations set out by the NSW government under Darling in 1829, which stated that streets needed to be at least 99 ft wide. However, Brisbane's streets were made narrower for two reasons: firstly to cut expenditure, since they were privately funded; and secondly because Darling's regulations were not enforceable in Brisbane because the CBD was developed with mostly private rather than public money, and because NSW law was no longer applicable in QLD from 1859, since it was now its own colony with its own laws.

Sounds like good rationale. In general, sales can be a rewarding career and is highly transportable to other industries as your interests change as well. Introverts can definitely be successful in sales, but you also need to understand that parts of it will be exhausting for you. The most successful sales people I know don every really shut off. That doesn mean you have to be working 100 hours a week necessarily, but usually it means you put in the late nights when you need you to, and answer the phone at all hours.

I always gotten the impression that he had a much bigger cultural impact in the US than he had here in Australia.

At least, it did during his life, but time has since been good to awareness of his legacy domestically.

We were in a really long hallway with concrete floors and cinder block walls, lit only by our flashlights. At least we were towards the end of the hallway and we could see the wall at our backs. At this point, I started to get really scared. Me and another guy said that we didn want to go down that hallway. Jim said, "what, do you think there are ghosts here?" and I said that there might be. Jim yells down that hallway, "IF THERE ARE ANY GHOSTS HERE, DO NOT FUCK WITH US." This made me really pissed off, and I asked him what the fuck he was trying to do to us. The other guys were really scared too, but Jim laughed at us and said that there aren any ghosts here and started walking down the hallway. We were pissed and scared but we kept going because who wants to be the first to bitch out when you 17 and abandoning creepy abandoned psych hospitals with your friends?

What some players do (when they're really good) is count the "value" of the deck, or, more specifically, how many aces and tens are left to be played (or this and that.) If lots are still to be seen, they up their bets, knowing the likelihood of them getting a good hand is better..

Small stakes players also tend to do better with small denomination cards. A pair of jacks may easily beat a pair of fours, but people who don't gamble much tend to win more with the fours or with any cards from twos to sevens.

"This has been developing over the past five or six months and has been vetted in our safety, building and building codes, and planning committees," City Manager Carl DeForest said of the three proposed ordinances regulating massage establishments and permitting their conditional use in the city's office commercial, general commercial, and Brunswick Town Center special planning district."This is similar to an ordinance adopted in Strongsville that has worked well for them and we have also had some issues here locally," DeForest said.The first of the four ordinances would establish a chapter of the city's codified ordinances regulating massage establishments.The ordinance defines a massage establishment as a business "having a source of income derived from the practice of massage," requires that employees be registered with the city, licensed as massage therapists or massage technicians, and requires that the business allow access for inspection by the city officials "from time to time during regular business hours." The ordinance also requires the establishment to have a business license, a certificate of occupancy and a conditional use permit; exempts physicians, nurses and barbers licensed under Ohio law; and bars minors and alcoholic beverages from massage establishments.The remaining three ordinances would include massage establishments as a conditionally permitted use in the city's C O office commercial, C G commercial, and the main street district of the Brunswick Town Center SPD 2.While two employees, Yan Wang, 38, of Brunswick, and Yang Gao, 43, of Pico Rivera, Calif., were arrested, Relax Massage Spa remains open. Brunswick Police Chief Brian Ohlin said police were unable to prove that the owners of the business had any knowledge of the illegal activity.. 
He took comfort in the fact that his grown children and grandchildren all lived close by. Carl was known locally as the Electrolux salesperson, a role he occupied for over 40 years.

Another reader decided to take issue with my recent comments about political correctness on the massage table and wanted to demonstrate why G strings can look quite attractive on men.

Okay, so much for the whole "our culture is similarly oppressive to women as theirs" speech. It not that I unaware of Afghani patriarchy. Long before George Dubbya cared about the plight of Afghan women, I was part of a network of academics and activists trying to bring the plight of women under the Taliban to the attention of Western policy makers. And the family, the murderous father, mother, and brother, were not exactly assimilated into Montreal life. Despite apparent economic success here (they were building a $900,000 home and drove a Lexus SUV), the parents speak neither English nor French and are probably fairly confused about what they did wrong since honor killings are right in much of Afghanistan.

I assume you were afraid of another club rolling off. This is a reasonable fear, but in poker you should be using a "I cross that bridge when I get there" kind of philosophy. Don do something drastic just because you aren sure what the correct play will be when the worst card comes off. 
There was some degree of minutiae before about the corruption that has defaced the government and media in the country. This shits plain as day now.

But isn describing the surface of female politicians their hair, their clothes, their shoes just another way of minimizing the content of their ideas? And isn that part of a larger misogyny? Everyone hates Dick Cheney because he evil, but he evil based on what he says. People hate Sarah Palin in a more personal way, because she pretty and stupid and homey and conservative perhaps, just as people hated Hilary Clinton before Barack put her somewhere safe because she didn care about pretty, wouldn bake cookies, and she smart.

And while removal results can be seen in as little as 15 minutes, the melting agent hyaluronidase can keep working for 48 hours, and sometimes dissolves unevenly   which is why, he says, it's best administered serially, over several days.
It's junk science. It's the scientific equivalent of fake news, and there's so many people who have rushed to pass judgement on it and are exhausting it. Just read thru the comments! It's the epitome of current state of climate science.There's plenty of people who are prominent scientists who have been climatologists their entire professional lives who are saying something very different then the hand selected CAGW crowd at NOAA, NASA, and worst of all IPCC.

 5 points  submitted 3 days agoMost companies have social media policies on what you are or are not allowed to say. Then on TOP of that they have very specific people who will control which sort of information gets out.Coming onto reddit, or Facebook, or any social media, saying that you work for Sony (regardless whether you go on to say you don speak for the company) means that to anyone reading your post, you now represent the entire company view on these issues.Then you go one worse and say that you got a company order to refuse refunds, except for 1 customer who spent "enough" in the PS Store that the company didn want to lose them.OP, i really hope nothing happens, but I also hope that you know you just risked your job to bitch at people online.

If you behind on life, but with both players having a modest board presence, Revenge often swaps life totals: if you got half of their life, you trade life. Going from 10 back to 20 life is pretty sweet and often buys you a round or two of all out attacks that you don have to block. In turn, that means your opponent can force you into sub optimal blocks with their attacks, so they might be less inclined to attack. That by itself helps you stabilize.
Well according to sources who aren't Billy The Kid, his lifetime kill count was four. Criminals inflated their murder stats for the same reason guys today inflate their sexual experience: It made them look cool.

The heat from the stones helps your muscles relax, allowing the massage therapist to manipulate your deep tissues more effectively.

SF Marathon does allow you to switch race distances down to the half (before a certain date, and with no refund; make sure you double check that), and the discounted price you get by signing up now is probably worth it.

I do think that you should really consider still giving 10%. Usually in the church, they teach that 10% is a reasonable/appropriate amount to give and you did say that the church has done a lot for you.
