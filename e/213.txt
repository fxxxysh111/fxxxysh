Yup. Heck, even with distance. My husband is from western Canada. I'm from Florida. It turns out that we do have some common ancestry around the 15th century. What's most interesting is that it's on the English side. I had thought for sure that the German lineage would have been more likely. (It might actually be, but German genealogy I find harder to trace at a certain point. Not sure if it's because I don't speak German or if it's because Germany wasn't Germany until 1871.)

The capitulation was not a distraction. For one, the idea that Trump would purposefully seek to "distract" from another news story by angering his base and looking weak in comparison to the House Dems ignores his character entirely.

Because polygraph machines are bullshit pseudoscience, really nothing more than voodoo props. They are based on the notion that there is a "lie response" that can be measured.

The problem with worshipping a formless, featureless god is that it leads to a path of frustration and tribulations are plenty. It is easier to worship a god with forms.

If you don pay by a pre determined date, then they can evict you in a short amount of time. The home will either be in a mobile home park or on the owners land. "Lot Rent" will probably be included with your total rental amount. The owner will probably pay the lot rent directly because it is their property on the line if you don pay. A mobile home park can evict or reposes the home if the lot rent isn paid.

Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know.

People are breaking new ground with what to do with a yoyo more consistently than with a kendama (again, from what I personally seen).

What I was getting at is I have genuinely met and known people who cannot use Cannabis of any strain or potency with the exception of CBD heavy low THC strains (Harliquin comes to mind) without suffering from paranoia or panic attacks, severe enough that they would try to call an ambulance for themselves, just like any medicine or plant, it may work for some, but to blanket it with a statement like do research and try a different strain, it's not that simple just as it's not that simple to prescribe medications to a patient, it won't always work the same for every person.

Eventually it came down to me and him and at this point in the game, I had become very, very careful as to which hands I would commit to seeing a flop for. Slowly but surely I would make a comeback from being down to $2.00 of chips compared to his $24.00. Henry would win a few hands but I made sure to only call him if I actually had something good. If it was a bottom pair, I fold without a second thought. My luck would come through when I had worked my way up to about $4.50 and went All in with a set of Jacks. Winning that pot gave me more freedom to bluff and win chips that way.

Playing tight means folding over 90% of your hands in the first three rounds. If this sounds boring, well, it is, but keep in mind that the biggest sit and go winners at the highest stakes only play slightly more hands than this, perhaps 15% or so. From early and middle position (first five positions from first to act) you should fold everything but AK and a pair of jacks or better. When you do play one of these hands, raise to four times the big blind. In late position, if it has not been raised, you can add AQ and other pairs, but simply call the big blind with these hands. Finally, if at any point in the early rounds you find yourself with less than 20 times the big blind, fold the AQ and other pairs.

So when you tell bronze and iron players to win their lane to gain their teams trust to do shotcalling you're saying nothing at all. New players don't know how to win their lane let alone what shots to call after they do. But infact it's worse than that. Your telling them to "get kills" which is the worst advice you can give a new player and ingrains terrible habits. Getting kills in lane means your A. Mechanically better than your opponent or B. Are skilled enough to recognize the mistakes. That requires an understanding of not just your champion, not just your opponents, but understanding when and how other players can intervene like junglers. So your strategy for players getting out of low elo is to mechanically outplay their opponent's while tracking the enemy jungler and then outplay the enemy team on the macro game. No bronze or iron player is going to do this. They are in bronze and iron because they can't. Just like "drive better" isn't good advice to a new driver neither is this.

Place can sometimes be very ephemeral   for example a phone number might be the place.

The 27 Feb 1915 issue of The Illustrated London News is remarkable. Yesterday's post was generated by an image appearing in it of sappers mining under a battlefield to create an underground attack on the enemy's trench lines.

Then halfway thru our route guy just places his hand on my leg. I was like, what? He was awake but looking ahead. I put my bag on top of my legs to shield it.

Just look at the amazing technology, medicine and abundance of food that surrounds us. Is each enabled by a magical imp or fairy inside or perhaps a magical incantation?

The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is a famous and popular game. Texas Hold'em is undoubtedly the most well known manifestation of the diversion.

At that point, they would either need to decrease their spending by approximately $11,000 per year, due the impact of inflation, or borrow against or sell their home..

The massage school I went to did 3 months of Thai and Eastern traditions, Gua Sha, cupping, Tok Sen, flower adornment arrangements, chanting, spiritual stuff etc etc. I learned traditional Thai on the mat with the person clothed. I also learned Thai on the table. It was an incredible experience. The other 3 months were western modalities of massage. Afterwards I got a job at a studio where Thai was offered. They really let you kind of do what you wanted there. There was a lot of beauty in that since everyone has a different style and touch. Now, I'm working at a higher end Ayurvedic spa. Thai is not offered there but they are very chill about everything as well. I always incorporate a little Thai into every massage I give. It's just part of my techniques now! I do live in Colorado where alternative healing is very common and widely accepted.

By this time there were 4 cops. 2 different city cops and 2 county cops and I thought I for sure was getting searched. He gave me a ticket for the restricted license, didn't search me and let me off on the insurance so I made out pretty good especially considering I already have a record but I just got my med card so I'm finally straight if I get pulled over with weed.

This is called "price improvement," and it works in your favour on Bitmex, IIRC. I could be wrong on this point, though.

Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, pick one and cross your fingers.
