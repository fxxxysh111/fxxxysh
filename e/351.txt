A partial counter to being outflanked is to pinwheel hard to counter the outflankers, sometimes augmented with JJ. Deploy all of your ships at speed 1. If your opponent sets up to outflank you to your left, then on turn 1 drop down to speed zero on the left flank, and turn up to speed 2 on the right flank. Then on turn 2 turn the engine back on so that you have some defenses ready when you start taking fire on turn 2 (or 3).

I think b/f is turn is fine, we block KJ, we get money in the pot from his Ax now (theres a lot of bad rivers not just for our hand but for his top pair hands too), we get value/protect against all his pair+gs or pair+fd hands that picked up equity on the turn, we also get the benefit of being able to xb most rivers since in general people rarely xc flop xc turn then donk river (and when they do its never ever as a bluff so we have an easy decision), although having said that in game i probably just check turn and snap most rivers/bet if x to.

Determine the number of outs available to you. Outs are cards that directly contribute to the hand you're trying to build. In some cases, you may have only 2 outs, meaning your chances of attaining a desirable hand is remote. Under ideal circumstances, 1 of 15 different outs can complete a strong hand. To tally your outs, you'll need to carefully assess your hand after the flop and then decide what hand you can attain. For example:

I very interested in universal basic income as an alternative to a minimum wage, but I have no idea how I would even begin to pay for it. I do believe that UBI will eventually become necessary as automation becomes more commonplace, and the population increases.

Prior jurisprudence has developed a number of factors that distinguish between negligence and negligence, including: the size of the omitted income compared to a taxpayer declared income, the opportunity for detecting the error and the taxpayer and intellect. was perhaps this last factor that proved the taxpayer ruin.

His work experience as a financial adviser included providing tax and financial advice. cross examination, the taxpayer stated he had knowledge of the associated tax benefits and consequences of the various financial products he sold, and acknowledged that payments had the potential to change from non taxable to taxable. For example, he knew how tax impacts life insurance proceeds differently than mutual funds.

Dan is het heel leuke dat Rutte speciaal gaat zitten met de grote vier gemeenten om over grote, mega dure OV projecten in de randstad te praten (ook necessary, vaak genoeg vast gestaan op A10) maar ze zouden op zijn minst gezien kunnen overwegen dat een fatsoenlijke, snelle OV verbinding naar het noorden ook ontlasting op de weg en op de huizenmarkt kan geven.

Tehmina Daultana was at her shrieking best to "let Imran Khan know that a few thousand agitators can't dictate the Parliament which represents 180 million Pakistanis."

It's because we're playing golf with a pretty generous allowance of "do overs." Golf is more fun if you can play the ball off the grass, instead of the mall parking lot you originally hit it in.

Quality is another huge consideration. Anything can be considered old   shoes, clothes, cars, electronics. But not everything old is of good enough quality to receive a label that carries as much clout as the word "vintage." A vintage wine, for instance, is one of particularly high quality, and vintage clothing must also be of excellent quality.

Amazon gets the Point of Sale (POS) data on things they don actually own . This wouldn be a problem if they were just a store front, logistics company, and payment processor for the people who own the goods.

Oh man, that really rough! My first one was 2.5 hours, barely got to the hospital, no time for an epidural. My husband says I turned purple at every contraction and I was unable to talk, but beyond needing oxygen, we weren in serious danger.

I am happy and yet bummed about Bernie. I so donated. I don't want to live in the past, though. It horrifies me. What I care about is actually a change of administration. We need to need to find someone to represent us. The democratic people. I used to love Elizabeth Warren, but she has an old lady voice that people can't escape. Kamala Harris is great, but she's controversial. Though really quick and smart. Hate to say it , but America isn't ready for a woman leader, yet. I love Beto, but he too has a way of speaking that alienates people, too. I want a decent smart, humble candidate who is ready to work for us and all Americans. Who can that be? Someone to beat Trump.

The Common Strengths and Weaknesses of the Year of the Horse Person Strengths The horse people are generally energetic, noble, free spirited and clever. They have ingenious communicating techniques and in their community they always want to be in the limelight, so they have good friends and are well liked by many people. Although they sometimes talk too much, they are cheerful, perceptive, talented, earthy but stubborn. They are able to come up with new ideas and active at work and refuse to be reconciled to failure, although their endeavor cannot last indefinitely. The Horse person is a sociable likeable person most of the time, they can take advantage of this by getting everybody to work together to achieve goals. Weaknesses The Horse person is patient up to a point, but they can be hot tempered. If you pushed too far, the Horse person can lose their temper. They cannot bear too much constraint. They then lash out (just like a horse) at others which can undo the good relationships they have built up with their good social skills. They can also be stubborn just like a horse. They are wasteful since they are not good with matters of finance due to a lack of budgetary efficiency. The Horse person has many followers but they are not always receptive to other points of view. They tend to interfere in many things and frequently fail to finish projects of their own.

Each opening has positives and negatives, which are documented and debated. Studying openings help you learn move orders that are good to accomplish a particular goal. You not only learn what moves you should make to support your goal, but you also learn the moves your opponent is likely to make in response to your moves. You learn which of your opponents moves are good and which are mistakes, and how to respond to them. Opening theory knowledge just cuts down on the amount of thinking you need to do in your actual games because you already know the likely scenarios off the top of your head. It decreases the odds you will blunder early; increases the odds of you being able to derive some advantage out of the position if your opponent doesn know the theory as well as you do; and lets you save time on your clock that you can use later in the mid and endgame and put your opponent under time pressure.

Undertow changed what I wanted out of music, and it turned a part of my brain on that never really turned off.

Looking back, I think she was actually the most progressive of the three sisters. Sybil was very flashy and vocal about everything she did socially and politically. Yes, she loved Tom, but I think she was also highly attracted to the idea of marrying a servant because of the social drama that would cause. Edith was always more reserved than Sybil but was almost more progressive. If Bertie hadn inherited the title, I think they would have been happy together and he would have supported her emotionally very well.

Texas Hold'em Poker Practice Tip  1: Avoid the new player blunder which is folding when you can check. As you should know, checking is defined as the passing turn you make without betting.

In poker our tight player gets dealt a pair of aces. This is what he has been waiting for and he comes out guns blazing. On the flop there might be some dangerous cards   such as 2 of the same suit   indicating that another player could have a flush draw. Another card with the same suit comes on the turn. But he ignores this and continues to bet. At the river the opponent turns over a 2,3 suited to the 3 table cards and wins with a low flush. Our ACES man is devasted. He had the much higher hand before the flop  it doesn seem fair! But poker is about the cards both now and in the future.

How many of these Great Whites are swimming about I cannot say. I have to assume that if someone like me, who lives in a veritable shark cage of liberal institutions and progressive neighborhoods, has bumped into a couple of Great Whites, then there are a lot of them out there. But the media is too busy focusing on the loud and ridiculous whites. The ones so clearly working against their own economic interests because they so crave the wages of whiteness. Most historians of whiteness argue that these wages were "paid" in a sense to working whites in order to keep them allied with the wealthy and against African Americans. But what about the people who actually pay the wages of whiteness? The invisible white elites who are willing to share some of the privileges of racial hierarchy without extending anything like economic security or even health care to their brothers and sisters in racism?
Control or moderation should be exercised in gambling as it should be in potentially dangerous activities like drinking alcohol and smoking.

Who says poker night is just for the boys? The popular card game has become a trendy way to get together with friends, for men and women alike. The key to a good poker night is having a table, preferably round, with enough room for everyone to sit around. It's also a good idea to have plenty of snacks and cold beverages on hand. Throw on a little music, shuffle the deck and you're all set for a fun night with your girlfriends. Like most girl's nights, poker affords the chance to do a lot of gabbing while you play popular versions of the classic games like Texas Hold 'Em and Seven Card Stud. Make sure someone is well acquainted with the rules, and don't worry about the gambling aspect of it. You can always just play with poker chips.

This bit of not common data (below) just came to me while I was fussing around in a volume of the Journal of the Franklin Institute (January June, 1833), and details the fires and the businesses in which they started. It is a curious bit, reminding me of a post I did some years ago about Charles Babbage tour of the broken windows of London. There were 209 fires, which really doesn seem to be an awful lot, all things considered. The business, though ("the buildings attacked by fire"), the ones consumed by fire, are mostly in themselves consumed now by time. Blacking makers, brass founders, brush makers, carvers and gilders, coachmakers, coopers, feltmongers, fringe makers, lampblack makers, milkmen,, , oil and color men, rag merchants, sack makers, scaleboard makers, straw bonnet makers, tinmen, and wadding makers, are all pretty much gone as standard enterprises. The turn in the road on road signs here was to paint the destination in black on a field of white, accompanied by a pointing hand. The sign then would "be visible at night, excepting in cases of unusual darkness, and may even then, if necessary, be read with the fingers". My word. Interesting that this attempt is made so early in the game for coach roads the same cannot be said for roads for automobiles, where it took into the 1920s and 1930s to invent the dividing lines in the center of the road to define lanes and put in shoulder lines (respectively).

He wanted to sedate him, take xrays, and fix the front teeth, and look around, as he thought it was "nerve damage" causing it because he was premature. When we got there it was a different dentist doing the procedure, he came out asked us if we knew what the plan was I said yes, repeated that back to him, he said yes and shook my hand.

The next step to handling your receipts is to have a physical ledger and a backup, such as a computer software program that can document the receipts. By doing this, you have a primary means of logging the income and expenses that you have, and you have a backup system in case something happens to the primary method. When dealing with your own company, regardless of what you sell, it is absolutely essential to keep accurate and duplicate records. This is especially true when it comes to contending with receipts for that business.
