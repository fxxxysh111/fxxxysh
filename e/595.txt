Natalie was a philosophy PhD candidate before dropping out and starting a youtube channel. Speaking as a philosophy student myself, academic study of philosophy tends to cultivate a way about how you consider and discuss subjects that other people find objectionable outside a strictly academic context.

I was part of the engineering team of senior classmen at the U last year that completed part of the research into using toll roads (and busses, and other engineering projects) for big cottonwood canyon. The tolls weren necessarily just for the roads, but to try and supplement the tiny budget alloted to big cottonwood canyon. The tolls would help for sanitation facilities, trail maintenance, conservation, bridges, additional bussing, etc. etc. There are millions of visitors every year (if I recall, nearly as many visitors as Yellowstone, but with a tiny fraction of the budget), and the canyons need as much help as they can get.

If you wanted to do something like this, it would be easier to the do the reverse of these videos where streams emit from the bottom as you play instead of approaching the piano like a "what's next" thing. You'd need some LCD panels to project the outgoing stream and tap into the MIDI output to know what keys were hit. Then it's just a matter of getting something like the Arduino to make the LCDs light up based on those inputs.

Ever since the day on which she had made her confession to Anne Leslie had been a changed creature. There was no trace of her old coldness and reserve, no shadow of her old bitterness. The girlhood of which she had been cheated seemed to come back to her with the ripeness of womanhood; she expanded like a flower of flame and perfume; no laugh was readier than hers, no wit quicker, in the twilight circles of that enchanted summer. When she could not be with them all felt that some exquisite savor was lacking in their intercourse. Her beauty was illumined by the awakened soul within, as some rosy lamp might shine through a flawless vase of alabaster. There were hours when Anne's eyes seemed to ache with the splendor of her. As for Owen Ford, the "Margaret" of his book, although she had the soft brown hair and elfin face of the real girl who had vanished so long ago, "pillowed where lost Atlantis sleeps," had the personality of Leslie Moore, as it was revealed to him in those halcyon days at Four Winds Harbor.

(The 20th century, even in its first decade or two, is another story.) The first was an article by the engineer John Ericsson, who wrote on the temperature of the heliosphere of the Sun in Nature for 1871 (and came quite close) which led to an earlier paper from 1868 in which he hypothesized a short lifespan of coal and advocated for forms of "solar energy".

Anyway I tripled thru and managed to outlast the rest to gain a seat in the NLH event for a paltry $230.

But the real strength is in the fact that hydrogen can slowly replace natural gas, both in incrementally enriching the gas itself and in upgrading existing gas turbines to being able to fire pure hydrogen. The natural gas replacement goes beyond electricity, not to mention industrial hydrogen. There really no softer path available for nuclear, instead the large upfront investments will be much more fraught with uncertainty in projections over many years; to be an acceptable investment some of the worst possible cases will have to at least not be devastating..

22, detectives spoke to the 16 year old and his legal guardian, after reading the boy his Miranda rights, according to the affidavit.Collins, in the interview, admitted to picking up a stick, but told investigators he didn't remember what happened after that until he saw Kulpa on the ground and thought, "Oh (expletive)."When asked by a detective how hard he hit Kulpa, on a scale of one to 10, Collins replied, "A six or something; I wanted to knock her out," adding that he did not want to kill her.According to the affidavit, Collins told investigators it was Montgomery's idea to attack Kulpa, and that Montgomery had said, "Let's kill her and take her car." Collins told investigators he chose to use a "blunt object" instead of the axes that were nearby.Collins added that he was "really, really drunk," and that Kulpa "gave me a lot of alcohol and I was stoned as hell." He also said she was hitting on him and was making him uncomfortable, according to the affidavit.But Collins also said, "I shouldn't have done it anyway," and added that, "I did think she was dead," according to the affidavit.Collins told investigators he only struck Kulpa once, although they noted, in the affidavit, that the woman "suffered two very serious injuries to her head."In a short interview at the hospital, Kulpa told investigators she did not remember the assault, only that she had picked up Collins and his friends while they were hitchhiking.While Collins is a juvenile, the Boulder County District Attorney's Office took the rare step of charging him as an adult.Berkenkotter initially prohibited prosecutors from publicly revealing what charges they filed against Collins because the proceedings in the case are temporarily under seal while she considers a defense motion to permanently seal all documents in the case.On Monday, though, District Attorney Stan Garnett released the charges his office filed last week: attempted first degree murder, first degree assault on an at risk person, and two crime of violence sentence enhancers.Collins could face eight to 24 years in prison on the attempted murder charge and 16 to 32 years in prison on the at risk assault charge, Garnett said.The teen remains in custody on $1 million bond and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in February.

Your dad has an X and Y, so if he gives you a Y. congratulations! You a boy! If he gives you an X, you a girl! That is where XX and XY comes from! If you have both genitalia, something went wrong! You experienced a mutation, causing deformation! Those are rare cases, and if those people want to choose, who stopping them? They can be both. because they ARE! If someone has a black parent and a white parent and are mixed, can they choose to be one, the other, or both? Can believe you that stupid. and claimed to be a biologist!

On the other hand, if you think that some opponents will fold part of their range to a larger bet size, it would be advantageous to "get folds" when you have a hand that doesn't play well multi way. But ONLY IF you know that enough players will fold to make that hand and that bet size worth playing.

That very likely. But theres also other possibilities. For example, liquidators (many of whom were military personel) were likely in better shape than the average Russian male. The average liquidator might have 2 decades of military experience in their lifetime, whereas the average Russian male might have 2 extra decades of office experience, and with that considered it likely the average Russian, non liquidator, would die earlier. That just one of many potential reasons I can think of.
