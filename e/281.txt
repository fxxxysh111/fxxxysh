She said herself that she used to dump guys for the smallest of reasons which is actually really unfair of her and she probably realized that just because a guy takes off his shoes without asking doesn mean his character and romantic potential lessens. 
Villain proudly tables Jd9h for the suicide bluff. I replay the hand in my head and realize that Villain has literally zero value combos that can jam river. Even if he had flushes in his range, he would only call river, and pretty much the only hands that can rejam river is FHs that he almost never has given my blockers and his turn check. So I realize that IF I WOULD HAVE TAKEN 15 SECONDS TO FUCKING THINK after getting jammed on I could have called and won the biggest pot of my life.

This comic has the double find of also showing the Earth being destroyed, which is a scene that you really don see until the end of the 19th century (excepting the raw canvas painted via Biblical gloom which has been around for a long time).

Without any intention to repeat ourselves, we'll just say this one more time   learn the game rules. It's the most useful advice you'll ever get.

As well as being extremely durable, familiarity is hard to fake. This makes the system difficult for fraudsters to crack. In the current study, the researchers asked volunteer attackers to watch a successful authentication sequence based on four target faces, so that they could pick out the same four faces from similar test grids. These attacks could be defeated simply by using different photos of the same faces in the test grids. For the user, who is familiar with the target faces, it is easy to recognize the faces across a range of images. For the attacker, who is unfamiliar with the target faces, generalizing across images is difficult.

I recommend some pop science books that make big physics concepts easy to understand. It fascinating stuff, and if the character loves physics, than she make every day connections to physics ideas all the time. A Brief Histoy of Time by Hawking, anything by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, or Carl Sagan would be my top picks and are probably in your local library and are fairly quick reads as well. Maybe try to find a blog or twitter account of a real physics student/post grad.

What can we do to prevent clear white teeth caused by fading color? For one, you can use whitening toothpastes. You can buy over the counter tooth pastes to bring back the white color of the teeth. This is easy because you do not need to purchase some dental products from your dentist.

In fact, neroli, valerian, and nutmeg are included in a blend patented by International Flavors and Fragrances, Inc., for easing stress in the workplace. 
At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it.

And out of nowhere, on January 2nd, Trump came out strongly supporting Russia 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.

With pop music's sudden fascination with all things Americana (and perhaps more likely, with reaching a middle American audience who's been vocal about feeling ignored by mainstream entertainment), it's clear this trend isn't done just yet.

For someone who seems so pro GTO such as Berkey, I find it hard for him to have a single hand in his range better than what he holding. If you folding close to 100% of your range in this spot (I guess you can have some AJ/A9 combos), you become very exploitable. Nguyen has more than enough XsXs in his range for you to be calling here profitably, and while it obviously way better to have A9/AJ here than 99 (since you block Ax combos) and 99 basically doesn have any blockers to his likely FH combos here   unless you throw in A9 suited in there which even if it is in his range would be incredibly unlikely since between you and the board there only ONE combo of A9s   (UTG+1 range), I still think this is a terrible fold.

Also men smoke disproportionately more than women in korea (supposedly this is because young women see what chain smoking old ladies look like and get scared, go figure) so smoking has a cool, masculine image associated with it.

We probably used to get touched a lot more (primate grooming is the broader category that includes human socialization/talking   which means we used to get touched/groomed all the time, and then it switched to being mainly verbal connections. We still obviously enjoy touch, though) and we lacking the social structure to ask people to touch us, so we pay people to do it. This is my analysis everytime I get a massage, acupuncture, physical therapy, etc. It also promotes blood flow, which can help healing and inflammation. And it definitely easier on you than the standard muscle relaxers doctors like to hand out. A lot of the problem is that those muscle knots tend to re form almost immediately. I have persistent muscle spasms in one shoulder (not always, but occasionally for weeks on end), and my best techniques are heat, meditation, exercise, and more heat. And Biofreeze. That stuff is AMAZING.

In your data analysis, I see you describe two statistical pitfalls. First, you state that you exclude data points from your analysis not because they are measurement errors, but because they don fit your vision of what the model should look like. It almost a self fulfilling prophecy, in the sense that you are exaggerating the difference between your comparison groups to prove that the two groups are different. The second pitfall is that you performed 4 independent analysis on the same data set to describe the variance, without including them in a single model as covariates (such as an appropriate regression model). If you were controlling the false positive rate of these analysis at 5%, that means the true false positive rate will be 1 (1 0.05)4 or about 18.5%.

This is getting into the nitty gritty, but some of the vowels that are the "same" between American English and Brazilian Portuguese (or any other two languages, for that matter) are in fact not exactly the same. For example, the English phoneme /i/ occupies a narrower range in the vowel space (if we conceive of the vowel space as being a two dimentional grid with the first and second formants as axes) because of the contrast with the nearby vowel //.

Another cheap and easy way to exchange money for sex is the so called "Laufhaus". those are the most common in the red light districts. they have the women sitting at the windows offering their service to people in the street, but there are usually more ladies inside. you talk to the lady, agree on service and price and then go inside her room and do the deed. my first experience with payed sex was in a Laufhaus in Hamburg and i got ripped off badly, because because we didn specify price and service before and once you naked and she has your dick in her hands, it hard to say no (especially when a bit drunk).

I think we should find a way to make oil refining and usage pollute a lot less and use it for things that specifically need it such as plastics and other petrochemical byproducts but should switch over to renewables that would make a marginal difference when done on a massive scale such as cars. I dont see why we cant have the best of both worlds. What will we do with all the oil laying underwater/underground if we switch to 100% renewables right now? As far as I know, oil when processed, is a greatly efficient fuel. It can be stored easily with minimal decay and produces massive amounts of energy when burnt. Think of it like a videogame. Would you not harvest all the possible resources to gain an advantage if your opponent does it as well or would you willingly handicap yourself by not using this resource?

Trump acolytes like yourself will always deflect current realities with red herring and straw man arguments, no matter how much evidence your confronted with. 
No not at all. Those odds leave room for reasonable doubt. Especially with a crime scene that was compromised as badly as this one was. There is reasonable doubt that there were no bones in Avery pit. The "forensic exam" was done at the sheriff office. There are NO crime scene photos and the exuming of the bones should have been recorded. Instead you have a box of bones that could have come from anywhere stored at the sheriff office before being brought to the examiner office and looking at 2 days later. Their was no chain of command. The "evidence" should never have seen the light of a courtroom.
"We will build a series of fortifications, all along our territory. And we will fly our flags high to make it clear who controls us. We will arm each pipe with our own fire breathers and establish patrols around each city. Bridges will be reinforced and walls raised."

It seems more likely to me that OP is lying than (a): a teacher could care so little for a child health and welfare as to expose them repeatedly and intentionally to an allergen that causes a reaction severe enough to be deemed "potentially life threatening," with the issue going completely unaddressed by school admins until such time that a 3rd party lawyer and insurance company (!?!) could weigh in, and (b) the teacher could convince the child, repeatedly, to consume the allergen against their parents wishes and then lie to the parents to insist that the kid took the snack and ran away to consume it before it could be recovered.

5) Time. It takes time and patience to grow your hair back out. It took my 2.5 years to get where I want to be. My hair is now long and thick like it was in high school. If you can stay away from heat styling and coloring, that's good, too. I try to trim it every 3 4 months. I probably should be getting it cut more often, but it's so healthy right now, I don't feel the need to. I've only highlighted my hair twice in the 2 years since I killed it. I also recommend putting deep conditioner or oil in your hair before you go to sleep, and then braiding it. Use scrunchies  regular hair ties cause your hair to break more.
Many classic Twilight Zone tails have been retold without reference or allusion and many more have been parodied as cliche, but what made these stories so resonant (as I see it) was that, in the post WW2 world, conventionally existential anxieties were made tangible.In the 1950 America reconstruction from the Second World War was psychological compared to the rest of the worlds very physical reconstruction.

Even if he was right about needing 10 tampons for your period, which is why wrong since they have to be changed every 4 8 hours so that at least 3 6 tampons a day, AT LEAST, he would be wrong about how many are needed. At the very least, this is if the girl is one of the lucky ones with a 3 day long period and she only has to change it 3 times a day since that the least amount of times that you can change it, that nine per cycle and that the lowest it can be.

What I want to be is like the images of J Lo that saturate our culture and my imagination.

Chinhairs are actually fallen eyebrows. They're a sort of secular version of fallen angels, and having them is a symptom of thinking dirty thoughts. That's why men get 'em when they're young and testosterone riddled and women get 'em when they're older and testosterone riddled. Chin hairs are also absolute proof that gravity works. Enlightenment is the only known cure, being the opposite of gravity.

Yeah, you right I was replying to the OP, but you did make a good point about what the old man real creepy intentions were.

Exactly. And my parents struggles individually and together helped motivate me to not have kids.
