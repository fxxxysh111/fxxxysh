This adaptation was made before the full enforcement of the Hays Code (1934 68), which means the film has a surprising degree of nudity and sexual references. When the film was re released five years later in 1936, eight minutes were edited out to allow the film to pass censorship regulations2. It was long believed that this edited material was lost forever, but the scenes were restored when the film was released on DVD.

We have a lot of fact checking going on now, likely more now than ever. That great! If you can run a News Organization that can withstand the fact checking, the credibility will build itself more and more.

For your height, the midpoint of the normal range for BMI is at 139 lbs.

You can hear the chasers trying to decide if they're seeing lightning or power flashes, that's how obscuring the rain is. Completely hides an EF5. People in the vans barely escaped getting blown a few hundred yards away from the road. Range line, the road they were on, was basically scoured of buildings and cars and features from the north to south side of the damage path. In fact, the damage path is still very visible on google maps. It's really really fucked up and I honestly recommend not watching it if you're having a bad day. Joplin was such a fucking disaster. Every so often there's just a spring that'll tear the absolute hell out of Dixie alley and it feels like it's already happening. Tornado outbreak last Sunday and the storm prediction center is predicting another potentially violent weekend in a few days.

Shino may be as blind as ever, but I think Eugene is finally understanding a little that the situation they are in is as much their issue as it is Orga reason that I like this scene with Eugene is because it contrasts well with the earlier scene of Engineer pulling up Dane and Pompadour discussion about how Tekkadan needs more guys like them. Tekkadan issue was never lacking people who could think, it was their lack of desire to speak up. Similarly any of the three new guys could have had a dramatic effect on Tekkadan but all three either lacked the desire (Dane) or influence (Pompadour) to step up or let themselves get caught up in the momentum of events (Hush).I loved that Piano only version of Crescent Moon.

"The casino entertainment industry has experienced anunprecedented surge in revenue growth in the past five years thatoutpaces nearly all other industry groups.

INDIANAPOLIS, IN Dec. 14, 2013 When it's your turn to act at the poker table   it's the moment for clarity, for wisdom, for experience and for logic to surface. It's mind over matter. For every move there's a counter. And for every action there's a reaction. Poker takes us on a journey that makes us run scenarios over and over in our own minds   hoping that every decision, every move was the right one. Will we ever know if we got our opponent to fold the best hand? Maybe. Maybe not. But one thing's for sure, they may never know what we held either.

That way superglue will have something to hold onto, and the bond will be significantly firmer.

Opponents of the Nancy Todd Poker Palace constitutional amendment still undergoing review for signature sufficiency by the secretary of state and still in the field for more signatures earlier had contested the legality of placing the measure on the ballot for a variety of flaws in the ballot title and content.Opponents raised anti trust questions and impact on existing casinos at the Southland and Oaklawn racetracks.

The firm has been advising Todd and her backers in Branson, Mo., from the outset.Todd's lawyer naturally says her amendment is legal, that arguments attacking it are incorrect or premature and that the amendment does NOT threaten existing gambling at the Southland and Oaklawn casinos. Why, that is not casino gambling, but electronic games of skill at existing parimutuel wagering facilities.

It was a very commendable job by Nast, who produced the drawing at the very dawn of the modern skyscraper age, just at the very beginning of the building and design practices tat would make it possible to build structures that were dozens of stories tall. The greatest advance was the introduction of cage frame construction, which started to appear ten years earlier, but most of the other stuff necessary to have tall structures heating and cooling capacities, electrical lighting, plumbing [with appropriate, siphon jet toilets], elevators with dependable brakes weren't really introduced until just after this cartoon appeared. The greatest of these early tall buildings, the Joseph Pulitzer York World building, looked quite like one of these Nast structures and was built in 1889/90, rising 300 feet or so into the air.

JRPGs have always been more story driven, and usually include some degree of romance. It been several years since I played one but I fondly remember the final fantasies I played growing up   started all the way to from 1 up to around 10.

It was a shock on arriving at theNew York Timesin 2004, as the paper's movie editor, to realize that its editorial dynamic was essentially the reverse. By and large, talented reporters scrambled to match stories with what internally was often called "the narrative."

And so India is now way ahead of the US in the sex wars. But this is one war we could actually win and no one would die and it wouldn cost a lot of money. If only we could remove ourselves from 500 years of binary thinking and a hundred years of creating the homosexual as having a very messy sex/gender (and the heterosexual as having a very clearly defined sex that goes along with the appropriate gender  manly men or femme women).

It not that far fetched a political strategy. been around at least since the Decembrists (no, not the Indie rock group  the Russian upstarts of the 1800s). Yet bombing the indivduals responsible is still the tactic of revolutionary groups. States and state like entities, like the US or Al Qaeda, prefer to bomb innocent civilian populations. although this is a tactic of power, it is really not a great way to get people on your side. when the powerless start taking out the individuals (and perhaps their families) who directly profit from the greed that is the oil industry, something revolutionary is afoot.

If you get a payday or title loan, you need to get only as much as you can afford to pay off all at once. They tell you "oh, you can get $3,000" and that sounds good until you find out you pay them $10,000 back over the life of the loan. So of you need $500, even if they offer $20,000, take the $500 and pay it back when you get paid.

I hope you don either. It a miserable life (and probably won exist in 10 15 years with technological advances). The thought of making it big in poker has always been way misguided. That like the worst thing possible. I hope you find a way to crush life away from poker and can then crush poker at mid and high stakes as a way to quench that competitive desire, have extra $ for blow/hookers/rare magic cards/season tickets/whatever your vice is while making professional and life contacts that payoff outside the room while at the table.

Although it is possible your fingerboard is warping, there should be a curve to your board, just about how you described it. A board with no curve to it is more likely to buzz. If you want to post a pic with the straightedge against the board so I can see the dip, it will help confirm, but it more likely that the temperature and humidity changes between summer and winter have brought the neck angle up, and that why the bridge seems low. If it a regular problem, you might look into getting a summer bridge and a winter bridge and switching them out as need be.

Although bad experiences (such as anxiety and agitation) are more common on 25x NBOMe due to adrenergic agonism causing unexpected stimulation, LSD itself binds to both 5 HT2a and D2   meaning it should have a higher risk for psychosis.

The hard truth is, it really hasn been until the last several years that many states had even begun licensing massage therapists. Actually, there are still a handful of states that are unregulated. Because of this, for decades in many places there hadn been any standards in place to show any level of education or competency for someone to call themselves a massage therapist. Some of those practitioners have been grandfathered in as licensing has been enacted (and sadly, some are teaching this misinformation as well.) It going to take time, but there are MANY of us that take our education and practices quite seriously, and want to raise the standards so that dribble like this will one day go away. After every massage, I would feel drained, lethargic, and almost like I was about to get the flu.

Similar thing happened to me at 7 or 8, I ran out from behind a building and into a parking lot and got hit by a car (it sorta damaged my knee and it randomly gives me issues ever since but over all I was not terribly hurt) I was more afraid of getting in trouble by my parents if they found out I ran out into traffic than I was of the fact that I hurt my knee so I walked away even though the adults at the scene were all mildly freaking out (I felt bad for the driver in hindsight, she was more upset than I was by a long shot) . I don know if anyone tried to call anything in about it because I basically got up as soon as I could and booked it home to my house 2 blocks away.. 
Another less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar casinos the dealer has to collect the cards, then shuffle and deal them after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour.

You better off not relying on it. It literally works on opioid receptors and behaves like an opioid. Your tolerance will sky rocket and you have to take more and more to get the effects you want. I seen so many stories of people exchanging their addictions for a kratom addiction, where they feel like they need kratom to function. meanwhile, they are telling themselves they are sober. You can actually get sober without transitioning into a lifetime use of another drug. You can actually be happier but quitting opioid addiction without transitioning to another opioid like compound. I felt myself relying on kratom at different points in my life. I just don recommend it.

If atomic decay were happening at 1000x the speed it happens today, it also going to be producing 1000x the heat.And that amount of heat would cook the Earth.Cepitore  4 points  submitted 9 days agoHow much extra heat would be produced if the decay rate was going at an increased rate for roughly 6 months? Also consider that the objective of the flood was to destroy the planet, so there would be a certain level of catastrophic heat that would still fit the narrative.This is all hypothetical, so if we are assuming there is something wrong with radiometric dating data, we couldn't even be sure that pressure was the sole cause of inflated dating calculations so we can't just chalk it all up as 100% due to increased decay rate.My point is, under these hypothetical assumptions, we don't know how much of the misinterpreted data is due to inconsistent decay, and therefore it's tough to guess how much heat the process produced.The main question is still, can pressure possibly alter decay rate? If yes, how much does it take, and if no, why?We just had a treatment on /r/debateevolution that attempted to put a number on this: they took the current heat gradient due to isotopic decay heat, and rolled it backwards to produce the numbers for a 6000 year old Earth assuming we got the decay rates wrong.This isn quite the scenario you asked about, but it fairly similar: instead of a one off event, it a constant rate change, so your scenario would produce a far higher peak temperature; it would still release the same amount of energy over time, so your 6 month scenario would be several thousand times hotter than this.Anyway, 1km underground would be 10x as hot as the sun, which I suggest is probably wrong.
