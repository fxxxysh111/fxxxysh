But when I went to America and Canada it honestly felt like healthy foods like smoothies, full grain bread, nuts, fish etc were a lot more expensive, but stuff like Doritos, coca cola and candy was ridiculously cheap. Eating out was the same with unhealthy food being much cheaper.

But the real strength is in the fact that hydrogen can slowly replace natural gas, both in incrementally enriching the gas itself and in upgrading existing gas turbines to being able to fire pure hydrogen. The natural gas replacement goes beyond electricity, not to mention industrial hydrogen. There really no softer path available for nuclear, instead the large upfront investments will be much more fraught with uncertainty in projections over many years; to be an acceptable investment some of the worst possible cases will have to at least not be devastating.

Life is what you make it. poker is a hard life? that really really subjective. once you get momentum you are literally printing money and it surreal. it just takes a huge level of maturity to view poker as a job. just a very very well paying job where you dealing w/ liquid cash on a consistent basis. wanna know what it feels like to make 20k a month, 35k a month, 16k a month, etc etc? it feels like busting a nut in megan fox mouth every morning. when you call the electrician in to fix your shit at 12 in the afternoon and you just made a grand in 5 minutes, it really fucking scary that poker may someday go away. once you reach a certain level of maturity, it becomes highly improbable you ever go broke. at that stage you start playing tournaments and a big cash is almost inevitable (if you not super incredibly bad). so suddenly you go from maybe a 75k net worth to a 450k net worth overnight.

Some 600m years after animals became multicellular, more than half of the fatty acid molecules in the light sensitive cells of the human eye are still DHA, and the proportion of DHA in the synapses of the brain is not far short of that, despite the fact that similar molecules are far more readily available.

As a consequence of his mother making a deal with Azazel (she was young, and she needed the money!) Sam was infected with demon blood when only six months old.

And Walsh, V. 2018. The physiological effects of Transcranial Electrical Stimulation do not apply to parameters commonly used in studies of Cognitive Neuromodulation. Neuropsychologia. The physiological basis of the claims for tDCS rests on the finding that 1 mA of unilateral anodal stimulation increases cortical excitation and 1 mA of cathodal produces inhibition. Here we show that these classic excitatory and inhibitory effects do not hold for the bilateral stimulation or 2 mA intensity conditions favoured in cognitive enhancement experiments. This is important because many, including some of the most salient claims are based on experiments using 2 mA bilateral stimulation. The claims for tRNS are also based on unilateral stimulation. Here we show that, again the classic excitatory effects of unilateral tRNS do not extend to the bilateral stimulation preferred in enhancement experiments. Further, we show that the effects of unilateral tRNS do not hold when one merely doubles the stimulation duration. and Walsh, V. 2017.

What makes you say that? I'll be honest I'm not well versed in GTO. When I play I try to exploit my opponent as much as possible, instead of playing as balanced as possible. I do play low stakes though so it works. Anyways in my mind I don't see how a prefect strategy exists for NLHE. There has to be some adjustments made facing certain opponents but my mindset could be wrong here. Also from my understanding solvers have been out for years but no one has solved NLHE yet. So how long will it take roughly to solve in your opinion?

Countless stories set in the 1950 and 60 juxtapose the conservative conformity with modern reprobates like racism, homophobia, drug use, spousal abuse and PTSD; all of which certainly existed in this time frame, and without public acceptability, but it arrogant of our cohort to assume every one of these sins was under the surface of every home as we "correct" the facade with our openness to these problems. I bring this up, because there is a trend to recontextualize this time period for what we think it problems were from our heuristic, and not where the people, at the time, would actually find anxiety.It is pop scholarly to cite that horror stories are reflective of the anxieties of their time.

The astringent quality of rose hip oil keeps the skin elastic, so it doesn't develop wrinkles, flaws are easily eliminated, burns and scars quickly heal, and your skin generally looks younger and more vibrant.

The places I go in Germany feature super hot women in their 20s and early 30s, and the sex is usually (but not always) damn fun. I also talk to the girls as extensively as I can. Most are from Romania, with Italy, Spain, Hungary, Ukraine, Germany, Latvia, and Greece showing up as well. The girls are very frank and realistic about their job and its risks/benefits. Most view it as an unglamorous but welcome opportunity to change their lives. They come to Germany anywhere from 2 weeks at a time to 8 months on a stretch. They will sleep in the same room where they work to save money (as the rooms are rented by the day), and they focus on working as much as possible to maximize what they take home. They usually make me feel welcome as a customer, have empathy for my motivations for being there, and try genuinely hard to make the experience satisfying. I try to be the nicest, most respectful customer they see that day, and I always pay more than they ask for. There are plenty of men in the world who can find a regular partner, or simply don want one. Brothels are an outlet for them and this place sounds fairly non threatening, although 20x in a night would need a lotta lube!

They take winning numbers of the previous draws count the frequency of winning of the numbers. Then, generally speaking, there are two options: to stake on the winning numbers or to stake on the numbers that have more rare winning results. In the first case the player hopes that the numbers will continue to win more often (such a trend), in the second case the player hopes that the frequency of winning numbers will be normalized and rare numbers will win more often.

As u/Devil TR notes, this sort of eggshells armed with sledgehammers scenario is quite similar to modern naval battles. In an era where even the smallest corvettes can be armed with hull rending anti ship missiles that can strike over the horizon with extreme accuracy and very little warning, and when spy satellites have rather spoiled the notion of a surprise attack, warfare becomes much more focused on maneuver and positioning than raw firepower or durability.

To give a satisfactory justification for public funding, the resolution of market failure by PSB needs to be shown convincingly.

Green felt is classic and if you have room that is paneled in dark wood or decorated with dark colors, you will find that it can be a great way to get the effect that you are after.

I think his point is, because he stated it pretty clearly, that the game hasn had bug fixes, because they just released an enhanced edition which did not have bug fixes.

So, as you see, you got to give up your 2bet and move on. 
You can see here that the orchestration jumps back to Step 1 after I resume the workflow.

In a tournament situation, frequently by the time you get to a heads up situation pre flop, the blinds are so large that the only decision to make is whether or not to go all in. If the blinds are still relatively small, pre flop play is not all that different from normal, but you may want to be a little more aggresive and try to steal more blinds. Position plays in a heads up situation becomes more complex later in the hand.

I think that's why this case has gotten to so many people; most just can't imagine doing something like this. I would say that we never will fully understand the reasoning behind what happened. In part because CW, I believe is incapable of telling the whole truth. But mostly because this just isn't something most people would do. Lots of people are unhappy, have affairs and then divorce. Lots of people go to family court and maintain a visitation schedule where they don't see their children as much. For whatever reason CW decided that's not what he wanted and it would be much better to just "rid of them". It's not logical and it doesn't make any sense but it's also exactly why we are all in disbelief. It would be easier if there was a solid reason, one that we could all sort of say "okay well he's still a monster but that! That makes more sense". But I don't think there is one. Furthermore, I think this is one of those "you think you know someone" things and that is extremely unsettling. SW had even texted friends that CW had changed. To think that a) someone can just snap at the drop of a hat or b) someone can hide their true evil self for that long is horror inducing, IMHO.
My experience working at an internet retailer was that when there was a complaint, Yamato would redeliver the package for free and refund the amount we paid them. If there were repeated complaints from one address they would have a supervisor deliver to that address once or twice. They don't generally fire people unless there is theft or the ever popular dump the package in the river and say it was delivered. As a small company, no matter how many complaints we couldn't afford to lose the Yamato contract so we would just try to keep customers happy with refunds, etc.

The only question I had left, and maybe most important to me of all, was whether or not I was actually missing out on something by not being vocal. She explained that if you not making sounds, then you probably not breathing very much, and breath is absolutely critical for an expanded orgasmic experience. sex is about energy and sound brings energy, she said. mean that in the physics sense, not in the woo woo sense. I always felt that I should make sounds only if they were so powerful that they could not otherwise be stopped that the only way I felt that my sex sounds would be authentic. The physical sensations, in my mind, had to lead to the audible.

The plan was really just a way for the military to get around the looming 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which made it illegal to test weapons in the upper atmosphere and in the ocean. The Sedan Test was Operation Plowshare's second test and it was, in scientific terms, a son of a bitch. The bomb was placed underground in a remote section of the Nevada desert in the hopes that nobody would notice. But the nuclear bomb erupted out of the earth like a pissed off radioactive volcano, releasing the seismic equivalent of a 4.75 earthquake and launching 6.6 million cubic yards of radioactive earth into the atmosphere. How much is that? Here's a picture from the observation deck of the quarter mile wide crater the explosion left behind."Can anyone else feel their sperm dying?"

Overall he is making a living from cards in Vegas and living the dream and I think that's why we all watch his VLOGs, and as said he's super genuine and a beyond great guy which makes it so much better.

Agreed. In fact, I don think we make the distinction clear enough. In a capitalist framework, these companies should be allowed to do this. They actively and loudly defend a resturant right to not serve black people, as if they just following their principles to their logical conclusion, but then won make a peep about Valve right to keep content off their platform. Almost as if this wasn a principled stance to begin with, and is just a ploy to bring back segregation.
The reason quick wraps don usually support the wrist well enough is because of their set form factor. If you have bigger wrists you need to wrap one or two more loops, if you have thin wrists, less.

It an understandable, human reaction for sure, and I don fault him for it nor I do feel bad for this guy. However, I think a more restrained officer could have waited a little longer before escalating the use of force simply to reduce the risk of injury.

First, though, it's important to understand why foot pain is so common. For relatively small body parts, the feet are amazingly complex structures: Each one contains 26 bones, 56 ligaments, 38 muscles, and an even greater number of nerves and blood vessels. All of those elements are targets for injury, mistreatment, and disease. In fact, your feet are more vulnerable to injury than any other part of the body, according to the American Podiatric Medicine Association. It's amazing they are not injured more often, considering how much we ask of them.

Homeschooling also used to be much more expensive. The internet was still in it early stages, so it wasn the resource it is now.

This led to the majority of homeschoolers being middle class and above.

Timberlake plays a grad student who can't afford his tuition. He tries to play online poker to win the money he needs, but ends up getting ripped off.

Lured into the world of fast cars and beautiful women, Timberlake soon finds himself caught between two opposing forces in Block and the FBI, and he must find a way out. This movie, despite a nonsensical premise, doesn't look half bad. Don't expect too much from it, but it won't be the worst thing out this fall.

Researchers state that, "Dysfunction of NMDA receptors seems to play a crucial role in the neurobiology of disorders such asParkinson disease,Alzheimer disease,epilepsy, ischemic stroke, anxiety and depression," such that, "ligands interacting with different sites of NMDA receptor complex are widely investigated as potential agents for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders" (22). In fact, drug inhibitors at the NMDA receptor complex, such as ketamine, demonstrate antidepressant effects (23, 24), but also induce such severe side effects that their clinical utility is limited (31). Magnesium, on the other hand, may have a similar mechanism of action by interfering with NMDA receptor activation without the adverse consequences of drug induced NMDA receptor blockade (25).

He and his cohorts were the first to document the presence of nociceptive nerve fibers (pain fibers) in the human disc in the late 80 His discovery revolutionized the management of axial complaints (spine) and has offered us great insight into the nature of the spinal discs and facet joints as pain generators.

Greek mythology long ago recognized that hubris usually gives way to nemesis. Wodehouse once wrote in his inimitable style, it is just when "a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping." Will Stout's ability to take measured risks help him navigate these threats and achieve his dream of financial independence? Or will his gambler's instinct prevail and impel him to extend himself too far? If the latter were to happen, Stout might have no choice but to turn his eyes to heaven and plead   as the factory worker Everett had done years earlier   "Make me even and I'll never gamble again.".

I really think that was a terrible stoppage and that Herb did not offer a fair assessment before calling the fight. I also think the defense claiming that it should be more palatable because "it was only a matter of time" isn't supported by previous instances where someone was choked unconscious with a choke not directly applied to the neck. It's definitely possible, but I can't recall anytime it has happened in MMA and its infrequency makes me very much doubt the idea that Robbie was inevitably going to go out in that position.

You be surprised what people will agree to sometimes. I was heads up in a WPT satellite where 1st received the $10k seat + $250 and 2nd received like $2.5k.

I ask what he wants and he just asks for the extra $250 dollars plus 2nd place money and I can have the seat. I snap accept. Guess he decided that the $2,750 was worth more to him than the seat.

Trussel also said that some of the main reasons people come into the shop range from lower back pain to shoulder pain. Also, the majority of people get a 60  to 90 minute massage, depending on the persons "patience level" for working out their issue.
He genuinely cares for Camille and develops very serious feelings for her that feel fleshed out. The part last episode where he got angry and said mean things out of heartbreak (not excusing it as okay but it felt understandable in the context), but you could see in his face how much he cared for her this episode even after all that stuff with John went down. I'm not sure how to interpret his reaction to her scars in the show, but it definitely wasn't the outright disgust he had in the book.

Imagine how epic the second movie/book would be if Harry had put a breaching charge on the bathroom wall, flash banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar weave stab vest, carrying a SPAS 12.

Hey, no problem! There really aren guidelines out there, so you just on your own.

(Nur paar Beispiele) 2 points  submitted 2 days agoIt possible it exists already but it isn widespread. Headlights that turn themselves off if you accidentally leave them on. Why can there be a pop up when you shut the car off confirming you meant to or have them shut off automatically after 10 minutes? I get auto headlights are a thing, but they don always come on when you need them to, like dusk or dawn, so you turn them on manually and they are easy to forget. 
This meant no leaving to go to the mosque for the majority of people, businesses were closed, the army roamed the streets looking for It just a sad situation, and I wish there was an easy solution that would result in peace for the region.

In 06 we got tickets to game 5. I was a freshman in HS and it was during finals of my first semester; a lot of my teachers weren't onboard with me missing finals for baseball but I had worked it out nevertheless. Game 4 gets rained out so I end up going to school on the date on our tickets because everything will be pushed back a day because of the rainout. Turns out some combo of MLB and the Cardinals org decided it makes more sense to inconvenience 45k people by 2 days than 90k people by one day; so people with game 5 tickets go on the day they were scheduled to what became game 4, and people with game 4 tickets go 2 days later than schedule to what became game 5, the clinching game. We find out the game is still on and I get pulled out of class in the middle of finals so we can drive the 4 hours to STL to make the game. Cards obviously win both and we got screwed out of seeing the clincher.
I promise you this is not sustainable.

What is so scary is that Sabean has not fired Dick Tidrow and the scouts yet. Obviously something is worng with the way these people scout college/HS hitters. Something is very wrong but sabean is not changing a thing. We understand scouting is not exact science but at least your scouts should be able to tell if the guy can play defense or hit an inside pitch or have displicine at the plate. we were sold that Cody Ransom was a great degensive player and that was crap. We were told Frandsen can play defense too. I can go on.
Even trips are often beat by a straight, flush, or full house. Hold'em players who start to play Omaha often not only play a hand like A A 7 8 but also will raise with it before the flop.

Touch and vocal communications help ussolidify our bonds as individuals who getalong with each other.

Your to do list is likely getting super long at this point, and I'm sorry if this feels overwhelming. But people like your mom operate out of the same playbook, generally, and this is stuff that, taken care of as a preventative measure, will make things easier in the long run.

Since several people might use the same massage chair, it's important to be able to make these adjustments. For example, a six foot (1.8 meter) tall user's back will make contact with more of the chair's backrest than a user who is only five feet (1.5 meters) tall. A neck massage for the six foot tall user would likely feel very odd to someone much shorter   if they were tall enough to feel it at all. By scanning the user's body, the chair can adjust so that the points of contact for each person are the appropriate height and width.
