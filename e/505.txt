In your example the pot odds are close or bad, so probably a fold as you deduced. The general questions is much more interesting. The way I see it, part of your edge is the ability for you to read hands and calculate pot odds better than your opponents. When you calculate that you have a +EV play (even if it something like getting 4 to 1 with 25% equity and you closing the action) you should take it. You losing EV if you don seems simple, but there are more factors. How tilted are you going to get if you make a correct pot odds call (but still likely to lose the hand) and then lose the pot? What if you are currently up and this would make you down for the session? How important is it to you to book a win on any given session? I would argue that if you can look past all of these factors and still stick to maximizing EV you have an even bigger edge over the people who are concerned about this other stuff.

Stories like Moneymaker's have stoked interest in hold 'em tournaments. At the World Series Main Event, the number of entrants leaped from 839 in 2003 to 8,773 in 2006. With more players and greater visibility, the events are seeing even bigger purses. The top prize at the Main Event jumped from $1 million in 1998 to a peak of $12 million in 2006.

Woodley can fight at the kind of pace Usman was putting on. He never has been able to. He slows the fights down with the threat of his overhand and wrestling. He couldn find the counter on Usman, and the rest of the fight was him trying to defend Usman pressure.

In Making Whiteness, historian Grace Hale argues that lynching arose after the Civil War as a nationally circulated spectacle through the new technologies of photography and the telegraph. Because the lynching of Black men could be represented  through press accounts and even postcards  throughout the country, lynching came to serve as a way of maintaining the racial order at a time when Black Americans were suddenly "free" and also moving to the North in great numbers.

Martha Ann Maxwell, who died in 1881, was a Colorado naturalist and artist who developed her own way of preserving dead animals. Not only did she help pioneer the budding field of taxidermy, she also insisted on placing her specimens in appropriate settings, or dioramas, which is now a common museum practice. One of her displays, Women's Work, was a hit at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. But her success was short lived, as her attempts to make a living off her innovations failed. In "Re/collect," Minneapolis artist Lex Thompson brings his documentary sensibility to bear on Maxwell's unsung, prescient practices. Daily from March 8 10; Free.

I don know what there is in this engraving that speaks "color" to me when it should probably be just concerning itself with the blackness of its deep black (which for me is usually the case). Neither the blackness nor the dimensionality of the thing it seems to give itself some height and depth at the same time say anything louder than the representation of its missing colors, which we are clearly seeing nothing of in these wavelengths except that there really aren any colors here outside of the beautiful black white. contrast is certainly there ("There are dark shadows on the earth, but its lights are stronger in the contrast." Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers), especially in the corner bits, where on closer inspection the blackness is really more white than black. In any event, the print suggests "color" to me for no good reason, except perhaps that it looks very cold, and cold is suggestive of ice blue, and the good contrast for that is yellow. "The sound of colors is so definite that it would be hard to find anyone who would express bright yellow with base notes, or dark lake with the treble." so wrote Mr. Kandinsky, who saw colors in his sound, and who in the midst of things wrote four experimental pieces of theater based upon this observation, the first and perhaps most prominent of which was called "Yellow" (1909). that is why this old engraving seems "yellow" to me (and this without any benefit of synesthesia).

How many times have you seen mindless under control? It either been Eren scream minions or Zeke slaves so far. While both types act on command, we haven had a case like this before where the controller has been in mortal danger/unconscious while the controlled mindless were around. Zeke slaves are a whole other beast(no pun intended) due to basically being infused with his genetics. There still a lot we don know about titans, titan biology, and especially titan psychology. There no reason to believe this Zeke slave wasn compelled to come to its master rescue and give its life to revive him. In terms of the healing ability itself, while we haven seen it we can say for sure it not a normal titan thing, for all we know the founding titan or Zeke could have easily commanded their controlled titans to do this if they knew it was possible. Zeke could have potentially used a titan slave at Shiganshina to heal up faster like this if he gave the command. The transfer of flesh is a very common thing in the relationships between shifters, their titan and human forms, and mindless as well.

This review included case series and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). A wide variety of massage protocols were used varying in type, duration and frequency of treatment. In the RCTs, massage was given within 20 minutes of exercise (most studies) or delayed up to 24 hours post exercise. Session length varied from five to 30 minutes. Session number varied between one and four sessions. Participants were either healthy but untrained volunteers or athletes of various levels. Both men and women were included. Age ranged from 18 years to 51 years. The most common outcome measures used in the RCTs were peak torque, maximum voluntary muscle contractions, blood lactate levels and serum neutrophil count.

The nasty underbelly of social media is a dilemma in the political arena, experts said, a reality underlined in London by two offensive tweets levelled at a city councillor Wednesday night.Online conversations on Twitter and elsewhere on social media lend themselves to open dialogue where community leaders, including politicians, are easy to access and questions can be posed publicly but there also little moderation for comments that stray over the line.Coun.

Unless someone can make a flush or a straight flush, (for example, if the QKA on the board are all the same suit and player 1 has J 10 in that suit), the pot is split equally among the 4 players. If two or more players make the same hand (or hands that rank the same) then the pot is split. In this case, assuming no available flushes, each player makes an Ace high straight. Since these are all the same rank   it doesn't matter than one player's ace comes from his hand instead of the board; the hands are still the same   the pot is split. (Full Answer)

This is getting into the nitty gritty, but some of the vowels that are the "same" between American English and Brazilian Portuguese (or any other two languages, for that matter) are in fact not exactly the same. For example, the English phoneme /i/ occupies a narrower range in the vowel space (if we conceive of the vowel space as being a two dimentional grid with the first and second formants as axes) because of the contrast with the nearby vowel //.

There were 20 of us. We all had to pay 100$ to get 1000 chips. We all had a blue chip (Survival chip) which we could use for another 1000 chips. The structure was 30 minutes each round. Starting with 1/2, 2/5, 5/10, 7/15, 10/20, 15/30, 25/50, 50/100 and so on. I lasted till the 50/100 (almost 6 hours including some short breaks). I started slow. I hit 1 8 pair on the flop and 1 10 pair on the turn. The cards open were a 2,7, 8 and 10. I had 8 and 10 in my hand. I played slow. The other guys knew I was new and I had been re raised which led to me folding in the past. This time, I was re raised on the turn and this was the biggest raise so far   200 chips. (Stupid mistake) I re raised him to 500 chips. Little did I know, he instantly called me and he had a straight. I was down to 300 350 odd chips. Then I won a few hands here and there. I thought I played well because I was able to increase the small pots well when I had a stronger hand. I somehow got through 6 rounds (3 hours) and I had 900+ chips. And then it was the last call to use the extra buy in. I was not gonna, but everybody with bigger stacks of 3000 chips also bought. 20 players had gone down to 12. So, I spent 100$ more.

For example, if your hand includes jack of spades, jack of diamonds, 10 of diamonds, 9 of diamonds, and 8 of diamonds, you have four cards to an open straight flush in diamonds, and you also have a pair of jacks or better. The four card open straight flush is higher on the list than the pair of jacks or better, so you would discard the jack of spades and draw to the four card straight flush.

People have been saying poker is dead for the better part of a decade now, but it clearly still beatable, and some people are still making lots of money. On the one hand, there is still room to beat this game if you good; on the other hand, the games at all limits have been getting harder and harder to beat, people are losing less and less, fish are increasingly scarce, and it is easily conceivable that we could reach a point in the fairly near future where only a small percentage of the best winning players could actually beat the rake. And this is still ignoring the fears that GTO bots could eventually just completely destroy the game..

The obvious double standard that Jesus taught was the difference between good and evil. You're just looking in the mirror And seeing yourself when you look at me. When a woman turns someone down at the bar, they should take it as their cue to leave. A Socio Neurological Perspective It can be reasonably argued that the larger cultural norms and traditions foster the disrespecting of women. All you need to do is to Turn back the words you say to me And say them to yourself To know the truth. If I were running The View, I'd fire Rosie. When the child repeatedly sasses, negates, and disobeys his Mom, does that mirror behaviors modeled within the family and culture , or is that more a cause of future behaviors generalized to social style and perpetuating the disrespect foisted upon women?

Fission takes place when a nucleus of uranium or plutonium captures a neutron. Because the neutron has no electric charge and is not repelled by the nucleus, temperature has no important influence on the fission reaction; no matter how slow the neutron, it can enter a uranium nucleus and cause fission. In fusion reactions, on the other hand, two nuclei, both with positive electric charges, must come into contact.

Consider, it is better to push all in by betting than by calling, since you want to look strong to have more impact.

Superiority or inferiority was indicated when the effect size equalled plus or minus 0.5.How were differences between studies investigated?Sensitivity analyses were performed by using different cut off points for the quality score to reclassify the level of evidence, and also by using different effect size cut off points to classify efficacy.Results of the reviewNine RCTs (683 patients) were included.Most of the included RCTs had substantial methodological flaws. The quality scores ranged from 21 to 87 out of 100 points.There were 2 RCTs of SMT versus amitriptyline: one involved 218 patients with chronic migraine and the other involved 150 patients with chronic and episodic tension type headaches.

But, I think they might fill up fast depending on the season you go. That might be easier than carrying one with you.

Sometimes people follow the present trend and choose to take a session of cheap Thai massage Sydney, because they heard their friends that they had tried it. They should know that Thai massage is an ancient healing technique that combines assisted yoga postures, acupressure and Indian Ayurvedic principles. It helps people to improve their circulation, because it uses yoga positions that are effective in refreshing circulation. It can also help people to boost their immune system because it invigorates the nervous system and helps at releasing toxins through improved circulation. Many people confuse Thai massage with Sydney remedial massage, but these two styles are different.

People who experiment conditions as sports injuries, sciatica or stiff necks can use it. Before deciding to try a specific massage style people should talk with their therapist, to see which one is suited for them.

Maybe ask him what he thinks and if he happy to keeping having family time or if that should be reduced (or paused) temporarily.

I didn't realize she would have to return to Brazil under the terms of the K1 visa if she wanted to remarry and stay here in the US.

Before the deal, each player places an ante into the pot and then receives two down cards (hole cards) and one face up card. The player with the lowest face up card (an ace is high in this situation) is required to start the betting action with an initial bet called the "bring in." The bring in must be at least the required minimum amount agreed upon before the game. Play continues to the left with either calls (to equal the previous opponent's bet), raises (to bet higher than the previous opponent), or folds (to resign). For example, if a player thought he had a strong hand and good chance of winning the round, he would raise the bet in attempt to generate the largest pot possible.

Definitely sample size is a factor but also you need to acknowledge that your playing style is not the most profitable way to play at those cash tables. If you aren willing to change just yet, then milk the fuck out of the way you play. For example, when you have Kings preflop, and people limp around to you, or if someone else raises and a few people make weak calls and then it gets to you, just make it like 60 70 dollars or some shit instead of like, lets say 45.

Yet another possible explanation for the word poker, is that it came from a version of an underworld slang word, "poke," a term used by pickpockets. Cardsharps who used the 20 card cheating game to relieve a sucker from his poke may have used that word among themselves, adding an r to make it "poker." The thought was that if the sharps used the word "poker" in front of their victims, those wise to the underworld slang would not surmise the change. Why did he call it Poker? Researchers looked into games of other countries to see if there was any game whose name sounded anything like "poker." They came up with an eighteenth century French game called poque , a German game that involves a certain amount of bluffing called Pochspiel , and there's even a suggestion that the word derived from a Hindu word: pukka .

I legitimately believe everyone should be carrying a big soft pillow in their car. Someone cuts you off in traffic? Pillow fight time. Someone just stole your space? Time to smack a bitch with something that wont actually harm them. Someone bumped your drink out of your hand in the club, go grab a pillow from the bouncers and lets clear a circle in the dance floor. Let out that aggression without the need for jail time, serious injuries, or anger. Of course it would also require a lot of mob justice so that if someone is packing a brick in the sack or throwing real punches everyone else can set things straight, but once we get everyone on board the world could be a fun place.

Bleach is a very useful chemical both around the house and for large scale use. You can use bleach to remove stains on clothing or to whiten your laundry. It's used to disinfect surfaces, too, especially in the kitchen and bathroom. You may have tried bleach to remove mold and mildew. Hospital personnel use bleach as a disinfectant, hotels use bleach to clean and disinfect bed linens and surfaces, and restaurants disinfect food preparation surfaces with chlorine bleach. People use chlorine in swimming pools to keep the water clean and raise the pH, and in much smaller concentrations to help keep municipal water supplies free of harmful organisms. Companies sometimes add chlorine bleach to industrial wastewater to reduce odor, and chlorine is used by the glass, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, agriculture, paint and paper industries [source: Lenntech]. With its many uses, bleach its a very familiar product to most people. in 1913, for use as an institutional disinfectant and a water treatment. Clorox Chemical, later called the Clorox Company, first gave samples of bleach to consumers for household use in 1922 [source: American Chemistry Council]. Since chlorine bleach was faster and more effective than the bleaches people had been using, it quickly became the most popular household bleach. Today, when we say "bleach," we usually mean chlorine bleach. So what exactly is chlorine bleach, and how does it work?

In Russian, a year is not a (cardinal) number but an ordinal number since years are read as if you said "in the 1948th year" or "in the 2012th year". If we pronounced years in English that way, then writing "He was born in the 1948th" would be wrong.

"Problem gamblers often come from groups within the community that are quite vulnerable   for instance [they] are more likely to be from backgrounds of disadvantage or lower socioeconomic status," Dr Randle said. "What this means is that money is being lost by particularly vulnerable groups, and while clubs say we redistribute the money to the community and that may be true, it isnot necessarily going back to the people that lost it." "So essentially many of the community services provided by clubs are helped being funded by the most marginalised and vulnerable people, who have an addiction."

But I have to keep moving. My second lap time was 1:15:17, a few minutes slower. No problem, I figured my first lap would be my fastest. I just wanted to maintain around a 1:15 for my third lap and I would be good!

I think one thing you and your husband may want to spend some time contemplating (you may have already) is if you feel called to foster vs feeling called to adopt. While both are incredibly important, they are distinctly different. The hardest lesson I've had to learn since we've started fostering is that reunification with biofamily is ALWAYS the goal. 
TL;DR: any regulation that singles out religious organizations for special treatment is suspect. 
I think you and the boyfriend need to have a conversation. He comes with the kids. That's never going to change. As his mother lives next door, that means that you're going to be seeing them doubly much due to the custody agreement she's wrangled. Now I don't agree with them walking in but that's not going to change unless you have a chat.

And what about the costs  financial and health wise  to going under the knife 51 times? Let face it: heroin addiction would have been less costly and possibly less risky, especially if drugs were legal and therefore the content of the product somewhat controlled. Not only that, but think of all the recovery time and lost productivity from 51 cosmetic procedures..

And they have managed to do this in a country and in a mass media that insists there "is no alternative." This grim space of hopelessness, this end of history where no alternative to capitalism can be imagined, is exactly the sort of loss of utopian vision that has immobilized the Left for decades.
It is not our compassion that being tested: it is our capacity for hope.. 
I took things too personally, certain things would set me off (breaking down into tears easily), and I reacted differently than most of the people I knew.. 
To understand why this matters, it helps to take a step back and look at the roots of Puerto Rico's troubles. They began in earnest in 1996 when the US Congress phased out a tax break for manufacturers that set up on the island.
People write lovely things like: "get your head out of your ass" and "stop drinking the Kool Aid" and "you so stupid they should fire you from your job." In other words, the story touched a nerve, and the nerve that is pulsating is tied up with racial fears, class anxieties, and women bodies. In other words, the nerve that that has been touched by the ACORN stories is so raw that even supposedly progressive political leaders like Barney Frank are distancing themselves from ACORN . 
Primarily, in a game where you happen to be a dealer and there is only the dealer and the blinds remaining to play, competing to steal such a pot is called blind stealing.

The problem is that determining "damage" is very, very, VERY difficult for an objective court unless they can see an actual monetary value attached to it, and so if he wants to sue he need to attach a monetary value somehow. For example, a clothes designer can discriminate against women if they are wanting a male to model the brand's male clothing. 
On Sunday, musical collective Sonic Bliss will play Gypsy World fusion. 
I'm a bitch. I'm a tease. I'm a goddess on my knees. When you're hurt. When you suffer I'm your angel undercover. I've been numb. I'm revived. Can't say I'm not alive. You know I wouldn't want it ANY other way!
Others have uneven layers of rock difficult to drill through. The Permian is rich in oil, and its shales are relatively easy to tap with today rigs.. 
"The email neatly ties up all the details about why Tiger hasn't been in out in public, but," Mikkelson says, given how hard the surgery would be to prove, "this is one of the parts of the email that I suspect is created out of whole cloth or has been embellished."
