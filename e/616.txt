David Malley's 1975 biography "The Ernie Kovacs Phile" helped spread the image of Kovacs as a poker playing, cigar chomping, ill rehearsed, budget busting savant burning the candle at both ends. 1990's "Kovacsland" by Diana Rico did little to balance the scales.

It felt shitty, but in hindsight I have always seen that they had valid reasons to complain.

If I buy a game, or a burger, I have certain expectations. I paid some amount and want this thing I bought to be comparable to ones I have bought in the past. Actually, I hope it will be better! In that case, I found my new burger place/game producer!

Girl 1 was a massage parlor worker. Petite, long black hair, and sweet. I fucked her, she was open to kissing, so I kept seeing her. The third time, while I was fucking her, she pulled my dick out of her and said "cum on my belly". I didn know what she meant, but suddenly, she took off the condom and put me back in her. WHOA. This was a completely different feeling. I couldn take more than 10 seconds and came on her stomach. Next time I came looking for her, she was not working there anymore.

Actually I have to disagree. It is much more important for software companies that students learn to use their software instead of paying for it those few years. They make it easily exploitable (sometimes even torrentable) on purpose so when students start to work commercially they are "forced" to invest in the software they know to use.

The RRSP savings would generate tax savings. They will vary with changes in gross income and any taxable events, but if we assume that Max is in a 40 per cent tax bracket, refunds from RRSP contributions could be $12,000 per year. That could go to paying down the three per cent mortgage, but Max and Loretta could likely earn a higher rate of return by investing the money in low fee exchange traded funds..

In the Eastern Woodlands alone (mostly the US east of the Mississippi), there are four major language families. Algic is represented by the various Algonquian languages like Ojibwe, Shawnee, Powhatan, and Wpanak. Iroquoian languages are represented by Cherokee, Seneca, Mohawk, Wendat, etc. Siouan languages are represented by Catawba and a few others formerly located in Appalachia and the Ohio Valley. Muskogean languages are represented by Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, etc. Then we get to the various language isolates like Tunica, Calusa, Timucua, Natchez, and Yuchi that don have obvious ties to other languages in the area (though some linguists have tried to link Tunica and Calusa together, Yuchi with the the Siouan languages, and Natchez with the Muskogean languages with limited plausibility).

From what I've seen, that's not true. I can't point out any black republicans like that atm, but I also don't just assume they don't exist. Female repubs/conservatives may be guilty of repeating the same slogans as others, just like every other partisan, but they're not 'subservient' to them. I've seen a lot of them say "I'm tired of the MSM telling me what to think just because I'm a woman." I follow right leaning meme pages a lot, that's where I see them. Women don't all have the same needs either, that's what separates the conservative woman from the others; they understand that not all women are alike.
There doesn need to be any specific news to move the market, the sentiment is generally negative about crypto right now, so other than the odd rally, the market is going to continue to bleed.

So actually I think flop raise size was good for anticipating one caller, but when you get two, well you now have a very awkward stack going into turn ($1200 with $700 in the middle).

But don you think it hysterical that some drug dealer who is responsible for x amount of deaths and endless pain and suffering thinks he better than a child killer?

The pain and suffering is incomparable to the admittedly heinous but relatively rare child killer. And what group accounts for the highest percentage of child deaths? The stats are clear: mothers. It doest get much lower than a child killer but to me a drug dealer is one of them.

A couple years ago my dad had a 1st cousin listed in his relatives on 23andMe who we didn't recognize. Eventually the cousin reached out to me and asked me if I knew [name] that he had heard from his mother, and I said yes, that's my dad's uncle. The cousin had lived his whole life thinking someone was his biological father, but then he found out he had a type of end stage renal disease that was genetic, that his dad didn't have, and things weren't adding up, so he asked his mom and got the real name. He'd done DNA testing in search of his biological father. I confirmed that my great uncle, cousins, and great grandfather suffered from the same disease. The cousin was mid 40's and DYING so I wanted to help him, so I secretly found out as much as I could and told him everything, and told him everything I already knew about the family history and shared my family tree. The cousin tried contacting my great uncle, but he didn't want a relationship with him at all  the responses were not straight up denials of being his father, it was like "good luck with the disease. Don't contact me again. Bye." So it's pretty sad. But at least he has confirmation that's who it was, and he has a lot of family history  and a few new cousins on Facebook.

This civilizing process manifested itself in little things, like an increasing control of the body and its functions. For instance, in courtly times, one blew one nose in one hand, ate with a knife, and went to the bathroom pretty much anywhere one wanted.

Why do you think they were all non english speaking people? They aren migrant workers. Pig farming is year round. Missouri has a really low Hispanic population relative to the rest of the country and Mexican immigrants tend to go to Chicago rather than St. Louis or elsewhere in Missouri. My guess is that the hispanic community there would be established for a few generations. They would just be very segregated.

It's finally happened! After years of watching and (hopeful) waiting, tomorrow is the day that I finally step into the TEDx arena alongside an amazing array of speakers to give a short talk about 'an idea worth spreading'. students need to provide a clear and succinct account of their thesis and why it matters in just 180 seconds. The aim is to not only make the students think and focus on the core intellectual 'hook' of their research but also to hone their communication skills so they can talk to multiple audiences in multiple ways about their research. This is all jolly good and to be encouraged. TEDx talks, however, represent something of the 'ber three minute thesis test' in the sense that not only must you tackle a big issue but you must also do so in a way that is sophisticated yet accessible, entertaining but serious and thought provoking but not ridiculous. You get eight minutes to do this, not three, but you only get one shot at giving the talk in front of a large live audience and an even larger online audience of many millions. This is reputational poker. Here is the essence of my pitch.

Dogs often seem to have limitless energy and robust constitutions, but don't let this fool you: they are susceptible to all sorts of maladies, ranging from mild to life threatening. That's why it pays to have a relationship with a dependable, reassuring veterinarian (to ensure good treatment and quick treatment in an emergency), and to follow wise guidelines for dog owners, which include regular checkups for your pooch and building your own store of knowledge about canine maladies, to catch treatable diseases early. Yes, dogs are energetic and robust by nature, but it's your job to help keep them that way.

The real question on this one is, has this dude donked with TP or better? If this was a drawee board or a low board, you might think that he donked to protect his TP type hand and take value of draws, but this is not a drawee board and its not a low board. If he has TP, the only reason he is betting is for value, and would he really bet here for value off an 8 or worse?! I think he be more likely to check and let you bluff.

It just a failure of reading comprehension on your part. They aren saying "90% of police encounters with black people result in a shooting." They are saying that, when they hear about the police encountering a black person, they expect it to end in a shooting 90% of the time. This isn a circle jerk for two reasons. First, as I explained, they are explaining their expectation, which requires no support from any data at all. Second, given that they are referring not to all police encounters with black people, but rather the ones they hear about, it isn unreasonable to suggest that a very high percentage of news worthy encounters do in fact end in violence. The vase majority of police encounters do not make the news. When they do they very frequently involve police violence.

The house takes their rake. 
This is an additional pathway that microbiota and pathogenic bacteria use to communicate with the brain via the immune system or through activation of local neurons in the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is a part of the autonomic nervous system that is housed in the gut and is responsible for gut motility and other normal gut functions.28 It is a vast network of neurons that are the first points of contact for microbiota in the intestinal lumen and are an important component of the brain gut axis.One of the most common clinical features of depression is dysregulation of the stress response system, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis.29 As was previously noted, in response to psychological, physiological, and pathological challenges, neurons in the hypothalamus are activated and signal the pituitary to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone into the bloodstream, which in turn activates the adrenal gland to release the stress hormone cortisol.

As expected, Carroll and her associates found the highest number of bacteria in plastic bowls, but the most harmful pathogens, including E. coli and MRSA, exploded in ceramic bowls. The researchers were shocked. "Ceramic was a surprise in that we found the most harmful microorganisms present," Carroll says. "At the moment, we can't say for sure why this is, but it could be that ceramic enables bacteria to form structures called biofilms, which allow large numbers of bacteria to adhere and colonize surfaces as a group and protects them from certain elements that would normally kill/remove bacteria."

To Answer your questions would take an enormous amount of speculation, which makes any answer to them completely worthless. The fact is that we have no idea if he been to other parlors. And if he has been, we have no idea if those involved sex trafficking of any kind.

MODERATOR OFwhat's this?TROPHY CASEreddit moldI been in those relationships and know people in them and it no big deal. I mean, as long as neither partner tries to pressure the other into being a different way, and as long as neither is judging the other, everything is cool. I also know a man that keeps it from his wife of many years. They seem very happy, but I can imagine hiding something like that from my spouse. Or even feeling the need to. I always wondered how she would feel if she found out after all those years of being lied to (because yes, lying by omission is still lying).

During my time with AppleCare I had a recurring gentleman who liked to have me help him organize his music with Apple Music. His iPhone was an earlier model (5, I think) with like 8GB of storage, so he had limited space. The phone was disconnected from cellular, so he pretty much used it as iPod over wi fi. He needed help downloading and managing his songs, because he would work out in his yard a lot and lose his wifi connection. So each time he called in I would hop in with Screen Sharing and help him offload the music he was tired of and download any newer songs he wanted. Each call totally killed my AHT for the day, but I always liked working with him. He was an upbeat guy in his 50s or 60s, and we would always have a good time talking about music while we were organizing his library. Each call would end with "Thanks, u/GeetarDood, I think I know how to do it now!" and each new call would start with "Hey u/GeetarDood, I remember us doing this thing last time and I can for the life of me remember how to do it again."

By weakening and removing the power of those around him, thelred effectively removed many of those with power possibly capable of acting against the Viking invaders.

A drinker may convince himself that he only drinks socially, or to relax on weekends. When an extra beer or glass of wine creeps in during the week, he may tell himself that it was a stressful day or that it's a one time thing.

For your baby, it should not be too soon after a feed (who wants to be poked in a full tummy?) or so close to a meal that the baby will be hungry and distracted.

My best friend kiddo had his fourth birthday at a petting zoo thing, and they had a baby/toddler kangaroo that they let hop around and let everyone pet and feed him. He was just on the outskirt age of being able to be around people; another month or so and he would have been too big, too adolescent and too aggressive to be around kids, but he was very cute. He hopped around in a diaper (apparently they shit CONSTANTLY) and kids were given food to feed him out of their hands.
