Today, as I visit the Science Museum I was interested to discover a letter from the Royal Archives, written in 1843 to my great great grandfather Prince Albert. Charles Babbage, credited as the world's first computer pioneer, designed the "Difference Engine", of which Prince Albert had the opportunity to see a prototype in July 1843. In the letter, Babbage told Queen Victoria and Prince Albert about his invention the "Analytical Engine" upon which the first computer programmes were created by Ada Lovelace, a daughter of Lord Byron. Today, I had the pleasure of learning about children's computer coding initiatives and it seems fitting to me that I publish this Instagram post, at the Science Museum which has long championed technology, innovation and inspired the next generation of inventors.

We use a pain scale from 0 to 10, 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain you could ever be in. There are several problems with that scale, the first being that it is subjective and so one person 5/10 is the next person 10/10. Therefore we have to gauge the effectiveness of our treatment against their responses and titrate accordingly. Has it got better? Can you tolerate it now? Is it still the same?

At their wedding it was nothing but love and smiles and gushing acceptance.

Well, the snippet below from an article in The Brooklyn Eagle (January 25, 1867, page 2) in which the agreements were made to start construction of the bridge (commencing in 1869) also included a section about the sale of the bridge from the corporation building it to NYC or Brooklyn or both.

Well, I agree with you that morality and ethics are a branch of philosophy, but the problem is that philosophers haven reached a consensus after debating the issues for 3,500+ years either. Thing is, they can continue debating for another 3,500 years but meanwhile the anthropologist has to reach a conclusion now and act on it every day in the course of their work. And it seems that the claim that morals are absolute requires proof which is not forthcoming, so it defaults to subjective until proven otherwise.

In fact, sunlight that reaches the earth's surface contains 52% to 55% near infrared light.

I've had some people say to me that they would prefer a c section to a vaginal tear and I'll never understand it. Admittedly, I haven't had one, but a tear that only requires a few stitches can't possibly be as bad as an abdominal incision. And to be honest, the worst part for me was not being able to take a real shower for weeks because of the incision. I had my first in December and I love nothing more than a hot shower in winter. That was kind of torture for me to only get half wet, and consequently, be half cold as I bathed. Sleeping also was horrible for 2 3 weeks which is not ideal when sleep in those first weeks is also hard to come by.

To measure blood levels based on breath, you need to know the vapor pressure of the substance   which is how a compound behaves when it moves from being a liquid to a gas, such as when a molecule leaves your blood and is exhaled in your breath. Molecules with a high vapor pressures, like ethyl alcohol are always escaping. That's why you can easily smell alcohol, whether on a person or an open bottle of rum.

Consider all possible outcomes. The great British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was noted for his cunning wit, among many other things. He had a reputation for crafting clever, biting quips and one liners out of thin air. In fact, because of a speech impediment, he actually crafted most of his witty responses beforehand by trying to consider every possible objection he might face.[2] Take Churchill's success to heart. Before important situations, take time to imagine every possible way the situation may play out and have your responses planned.

But after their doctors ruled out other causes, all three adults did their own research and cut gluten and saw the symptoms subside.A new study in the journal BMC Medicine may shed some light on why. It shows gluten can set off a distinct reaction in the intestines and the immune system, even in people who don have celiac disease.The news will be welcome to people who have suspected a broad range of ailments may be linked to their gluten intake, but have failed to find doctors who agree.have been told if it wasn celiac disease, it wasn anything. It was all in their heads, says Cynthia Kupper, executive director of the nonprofit Gluten Intolerance Group of North America.The growing market for gluten free foods, with sales estimated at $2.6 billion last year, has made it even harder to distinguish a medical insight from a fad.Although much remains unknown, it is clear that gluten a staple of human diets for 10,000 years triggers an immune response like an enemy invader in some modern humans.The most basic negative response is an allergic reaction to wheat that quickly brings on hives, congestion, nausea or potentially fatal anaphylaxis.

I don have any issue with barney being in there, no matter how the PDC try to spin it the premier league is just a fun exhibition event that also makes them a bit of money and hence it makes sense for them to put all their biggest crowd favourites/draws in (which barney is one of, especially since its his last season), but he definitely not there on merit.

I also suspect that thinking about having a man around to help care for the kids and manage household chores can help reduce stress for a lot of women.

And a stay at home dad can be the ultimate helper.

This is hypocrisy doubled down. The connection between the two events is that Wall Streeters absolutely love poker.

Puritan Preet's raid on Internet poker sites in a country where gambling is legal in all 50 states, where governments are pushing their own lottery games every day, seems a bit contradictory to say the least and I'm willing to bet that some of Bharara's staff have played poker.

After these kinds of old saws, there are basically only two things you can communicate without betting: stregnth or weakness. Leaning towards the table, staring down an opponent, asking for a chip count, quickly making bets, drumming your fingers, "so what's it gonna be?" style taunts, placing hands and arms on the table, etc etc etc communicate stregnth. Leaning back in the chair, talking about anything other than the current hand, getting up to grab a beer, talking to players other than your opponent, folding your arms, etc etc all communicate weakness. Beginning players will always communicate stregnth when they are weak, and act weak when they are strong. Advanced players will understand the signals their bodies are sending, and its your job as a player to figure out more WHY they are sending you tells than WHAT tells they are sending.

Something filled my heart, something that had been there, right next to the rage, ever since the day that I walked inside of the Guild Hall. For the longest time I put it aside, ignoring it, but every time I did, all that happened was it growing stronger and stronger. I thought, for so long that all that I had was my rage, the source of my power itself, but now, it was gone, and my magic along with it. Living so long with that desire to finish things, that urge for revenge, made me feel empty without it. I pushed away, feeling washed up, and burnt out. I thought that my dream was over and that everything was behind me, including Atlas, the very people who looked so happy as they pieced together their world. But my isolation had been lonely, and that feeling that I had, had vanished.

It was a drop of about 2.6 per cent.But the price has recovered during the early afternoon, and is none back at $69.82, MarketWatch reports.It came after United CEO Oscar Munoz released a statement Monday night that doubled down on his airline crew's decision to remove an elderly passenger, claiming he was'disruptive and belligerent'.The airline is facing a furious backlash after footage emerged of the 69 year old, bleeding heavily as he was pulled from the jet.Amidst the anger, Munoz issued a public apology saying he 'apologized for having to re accommodate these customers.'But in a private email to employees, the CEO defended the crew's actions, calling the passenger'disruptive and belligerent' and praising his staff for going 'above and beyond'.Social media erupted immediately, labeling Munoz and United 'tone deaf' and 'condescending'.Munoz said that while he was 'upset' to hear about the man being violently dragged off the flight, that airline crew had simply been following 'established procedures.'The CEO described how flight crews had offered up to $1,000 in compensation for anyone willing to catch the next flight before approaching the passenger to 'explain apologetically' that he was being denied boarding.He had then 'raised his voice and refused to comply' with the crew's requests to leave the aircraft, and became increasingly 'disruptive and belligerent,' he said.'Our agents were left with no choice, but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight, he repeatedly decline to leave.'Munoz added that the passenger refused to comply with the officers who then 'physically removed him from the flight as he continued to resist   running back onto the aircraft in defiance of both out crew and security officials.'The comments have sparked outrage online with people claiming that the CEO was attempting to shift blame to the police'While I deeply regret this situation arose, I also emphatically stand behind all of you, and I want to commend you for continuing to go above and beyond to ensure we fly right,' he said.The CEO did, however, concede that there were 'lessons we can learn' from the experience and that United will continue to look into the incident.He also had a final reminder that treating customers with 'respect and dignity' should be matter of course, 'no matter how challenging the situation.'.

You only real mistake was jamming overtop on the river. Why?
I actually checked out a bit online and apparently the 7900 series is (was) really bad with this. Apparently what was happening was that 7900 cards would turn off the monitor like normal and then after they did it, the card went into a really low power state with powerplay. Sometimes though, the card went so low, that it couldn't recover when you wanted to come back into Windows so it just froze the entire computer because the drivers crashed. I think thats also whats been happening with me.

Variance can be argued to be things outside of your control that determine the outcome of the game. Since chess is often determined by one mistake, especially when equally matched or nearly equal players are playing, things that give you an off day will produce variance.

I thought the added comedy was hit or miss, and although Tree mom being alive was a nice dramatic dilemma, their scenes together often felt overdone and awkwardly clashed tonally with the rest of the movie. There were also a couple climactic scenes too many. As for the time travel logistics (or lack of) I usually able to suspend my disbelief for such things and just go along with it.

It was at this time thought that this manner of interring their Dead was not common to all ranks of People, as this was the first we had seen Except the Skeleton just mentioned; but various were the opinions concerning the Provisions, etc., laid about the Dead. Upon the whole, it should seem that these people not only believe in a Supreem being, but in a future state also, and this must be meant either as an Offering to some Deitie or for the use of the Dead in the other world; but this latter is not very probable, as there appeared to be no Priest Craft in the thing, for whatever Provisions were put there it appeared very plain to us that there it remain'd until it consumed away of itself.

There is considerable accent on body and bodily functions throughout the 10 poems within (5 x 'dark'; 5 x 'light'). Indeed, the very first saturnine poem, Bad Charity, regales the reader with bones, tears, frameless selves, skeleton, fractures   all in nine lines. The next poem, The Lost Art of Kissing a Government, delves further into the corpus both literally, and figuratively, as Taito refers to mouths (x 3), lips, teeth, tonsils, forked tongues, eyes, screams. Here she eviscerates not only governments, but also we who no longer chew up at and spit out legislators and administrators, and merely suck up to them.

If I R. Kelly defense attorney and this just came out, I am immediately filing for an injunction excluding any evidence that relates to anything the former counsel said. It all based on a breach of privilege and is similar to a breach of the right to not testify against oneself. There an argument that the prosecutors/police only know to look for certain evidence because of this privilege breach, thus making it fruit of the poisonous tree. I don know what the prosecutor case is, but if I prosecuting, I would be very pissed off because now the whole investigation has this cloud over it. Anything from this point on that uncovered relating to those specific crimes has a chance of being excluded.

I would like to give an alternate view on the matter. LoL is an investment and a hobby/interest. People forget this but there are markets similar to this all around the world; football clubs, national athletes and even animal racing. My family has shares in horses and owns a bunch of greyhounds. We watch them race and have spent a lot of money, especially in the short term. Horses can cost an absurd amount before they even start racing, and they can fall flat. But people still buy them and race them, knowing fair well the risks associated. If I was an investor I would be looking a year down the track and wondering what possible uphills there could be, people are looking too narrowly and in a present focus. Prize money will rise from pressures from other esports, the number of big sponsors will rise as it becomes more stable. Investors don want to be stuck behind the curve so they take the risk, because if they don then they will miss their big chance. People keep worrying about this huge collapse that won happen unless people stop watching esports and/or playing the game. Revealing salaries is fine also; but could cause internal disputes between players as skill levels can rise and fall so rapidly, and the inability to pay all players the same due to demand. That and brand integrity are the ONLY reasons you can make towards hiding your salaries, stop making strawman arguments and pretending like this is a because LoL is well underfunded compared to other esports, especially in prize money.
