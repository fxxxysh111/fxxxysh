9/11 alone was a bigger loss of life than all Christian terrorism in the last 100 years. Which is smaller than the 5000 yazidis executed by ISIS, smaller than the 3500 slaves they took, smaller than their non Muslim persecution. During the same time, 1200 people died to muslim terror attacks around the globe but out of war zones. In the same time span as 10,000 Islamic caused terror deaths you have less than 100 you could safely call Christian.
"The government proposed poker machine reforms are far from perfect; but they better than nothing and worth pursuing," Mr Wilkie said.
Like all processes, the civilizing one can stop. It clearly is stopping in American politics and maybe daily life more generally. Not to sound too much like my mother, but bodily control (from farting to burping to habits of eating) is surely less severe than it was just a generation ago. And this is not necessarily a bad thing.

Medical exams had not been done, many people were initially non deployable due to medical and dental issues.

And my audience was the kind that one can only hope for. When I'd finished I looked at my father and saw he was crying. This was probably the most important lesson that my father taught me. I understood then that I wanted to become a musician. And I understood why I must do this.

ON THE BLOCK: On a week of sad injury setbacks, spare a thought for Ben Reid. While Collingwood got through their AFL game against the Brisbane Lions with a clean bill of health, it was a familiar tale in the VFL. Reid has torn the same calf that kept him out since Round 10 and with only three weeks before finals and has been ruled out for the rest of the season. It's another blow for the luckless defender, who was making his long awaited return.
Believe it or not, there is a price tag attached to weight. Naturally, if a poker chip is light it is going to be cheaper than one that is heavy. This is because of the fact that most light weight poker chips are constructed with cheap plastic. Higher priced materials such as clay composite, ceramic, and wood are used to create chips that are heavier. Therefore, the price will be a bit higher. If you are purchasing casino poker chips on a budget, it is important to pay special attention to the weight that you are purchasing.

They're so scared of being held accountable for having totally fucked the country for their own benefit over the last 40 years. They never admit it though, it's always, "you just don't have the necessary life experience to understand that you being financially stable is not helpful to us, so go fuck yourself." I genuinely wish there was a plague that wiped out everyone over the age of 60, sure I'd miss my parents but then maybe I would be able to have a job that allows me a fraction of the stability and dignity that my parents had when they were 5 years younger than me. That's a solid trade off to me..

The rhetoric used by Whigs/Patriots against the perceived overreach by the British government was very. Dramatic. What Samuel Adams, and many, many other politically active individuals in the thirteen colonies meant by slavery was slavery in the figurative sense. That is, that the imposed taxes and other policies by the British parliament would effectively lead to the dismantling of their natural born rights (which every Briton had). If parliament forced taxation upon those who had always autonomously tax themselves, what not to say that they would go even further?

Unfortunately his terms aren very well defined was he addressing the coal production of Prussia or Europe or the world when discussing "the quantity of coal dug in 1857"? When stating "the lands from which the coal is procured" may be 8,000 square miles, did that mean an 8,000 square mile swath of Germany, or 8,000 square miles of mined coal in Europe, or etc.? New Hampshire is about 8,000 square miles, and the entire Prussian Monarchy was about 110,000 square miles, so maybe that meant packets of mining surfaces here and there? don know.

I not sure why you assume anything should have to be determined "on the platform" except in the most extreme and unforeseen circumstances, which this, like most situations, was not. In this specific case, the critical damage occurred over a minute after liftoff, and they didn even suspect it until two days later. But most importantly, this failure, like most, was predetermined long before due to institutional failure   in this case, failure of leadership, mainly (irrationally) ignoring the reasonable and evidence based concerns raised by engineers over a period of years specifically regarding unexpected tile damage threatening complete loss of craft. This, despite coming extremely close to a total loss of Atlantis in the late 1980s due to tile damage. Instead of investigating and determining the underlying cause of foam loss years before Columbia was lost, they didn figure it out until a full three years after (which was a year after nearly losing Discovery). So yeah, not sure what "on the platform" is really supposed to mean, even if you consider it rhetorical   whether it the space shuttle, or a product launch, or anything else in life. It generally means you actually failed well in advance and didn recognize it.

Immediately after the shower, it straight on to a very good bareback blowjob while the second lady showers. After she is finished, she joins in with the oral action and from there, it on to the sex. How and what you do is up to you. I banged each of them a couple of times while kissing and touching the other and then elected to take a rest and watch them do the lesbian routine. It was OK but not as hot as I thought it would be. I sure it would have been hotter if both women were sexy. As it was, I was stuck with the dilemma of banging the hot one and looking at/playing with the less attractive one, or vice versa, and I didn want to pay too much attention to the sexy one and make the other one feel bad. Maybe, as Thais like to say, I think too much?

The reverse can happen as well   in some studies, patients who were told they were taken off a powerful pain medication began to feel worse, even though they were still being administered the medication without their knowledge [source: Thernstrom].

And they don give a shit about anything else in life at all, so they going to work A LOT harder than you.

This is because the human mind thinks that time is linear and "How can an angel tell the future to a person if the event hasn't happened yet? It's impossible." In order for prophecy to exist the future must have already happened and any psychiatrist will tell you that this is impossible..

Throughout Europe, Arabia, and India, incense proved to be immensely versatile; it was used as perfume, medicine, and even mouthwash. Remember, early incense contained nothing other than ground herbs, plant gums, and honey. (Only much later was messy charcoal and inedible saltpeter added so that, once ignited, it would continue burning.) Since most of the herbs were highly antiseptic, when rubbed on the skin and melted by body heat, they released a scent and disinfected wounds. Incense was even ingested as medicine. It is no surprise, then, that the Greek word aromata had several meanings: incense, perfume, spice, and aromatic medicine. The Chinese also had one word, heang, to describe perfume, incense, and the concept of fragrance.

The planet was originally settled by the Prehistoric Life Research Group with the specific intention of recreating ecosystems from Earth past. The atmosphere required some tweaking to reach entirely breathable quality, and this was an opportunity to increase the oxygen levels above those of Earth, to better reflect conditions in prior ecological eras. This planet was chosen specifically because a ready baked, human habitable world was a much more attractive prospect to commercial and national settlement projects, and in the earliest era of offworld settlement even partial terraforming was a somewhat laborious and expensive prospect when compared with the pressing need to find human beings homes..

Like what would happen if people like Mr. Weasley knew how everything worked? Not only would that be beneficial for his job, but he would be so much better at inventing things.

If the "elites" really had such a plan, it a little late now to put it into action in my opinion. If their intent is to be able to rebuilt comfortably on the ashes with a long term perspective for themselves I would have recommeded them to do it in the 1980s at the latest, before we put all those massive amounts of extra CO2 into the atmosphere that poses a high risk to push us into runaway climate change.

Younger generations have no wealth, so those policies are fucking useless for current/future generations and will fuck all of us over if we don't do everything we can to hold the rich to account. Millennials are a bigger voting block than boomers now, add Gen X to that and Boomers should be pushed aside easily..

Leslie seemed always to enjoy those lighthouse carousals very much, and bloomed out for the time being into ready wit and beautiful laughter, or glowing eyed silence.

But rather than a mother fearing passengers reactions, I rather we created a society where a mother might have reason to expect kindness and empathy instead.

We should see a crying baby and automatically excuse her and her mother.

At any time, when there is only one player remaining, the pot is awarded to that player, and this is where all the bluffing comes in, that player does not need to show his cards. (so you'll never know!) If more players stay in, at the end of play all hole cards are shown and each player makes up the best possible 5 card hand, you may use both, one or none of your hole cards to make up your hand. As in other poker games, the same hierarchy of winning hands counts, from a straight flush, 4 of a kind, full house all the way down to one pair or just high card.
Also, just to fill you in with more about how I do the storage and streaming, I have everything recorded on a couple of black magic design hyperdeck minis, because SD cards are easy.

I didn realize I was bisexual until I was 16, and by that time my parents had gotten out of that belief system and swung back to the left leaning they had in college, so they were very supporting and accepting.

This system lets us pick an option that a majority prefers and still give more than two options which is good, because nearly all the options we put in the poll came directly from a feedback thread we ran a few weeks before the vote itself.I avoided this asking in a public thread because I didn want any to deal with any tumblr style downvote mobs or lynchings, but is there a reason why Pokemon arts and crafts aren their own sub? I mentioned this in the survey thing before the vote was held, but I stated that in my opinion, the majority of threads in any sub should be discussion threads and it looked like every other Pokemon subject has that except for arts and crafts.At this point, all of the subreddit rules are supported by community votes. So the reason any one thing is allowed or not allowed is because of that! If people vote to ban all art and craft posts when we do another vote like this (which we will do regularly, to make sure the rules line up with people preferences), then we do it. For the time being, though, art and craft are quite popular on the subreddit, and we don want to ban them unless asked to do it via a vote.[M]  36 points  submitted 21 days agoTo explain this even further: of course craft is an artform!

The problem with children is that at certain ages they vary drastically in size. Because of this, in order to administer drugs safely you need to work out their surface area (Weight in KG x Height in CM / 3600). This is why most medications marketed towards children are in liquid form. On top of this is the fact that many medications that are safe long term for adults are not so for children. This is why you see many children on steroidal inhalers or bronchodialators rather than taking pills every morning like adults do.

Molly is a bit like that. As portrayed by Jessica Chastain, this driven, brilliant woman was on her way to Olympic glory when a freak accident took her out of competition. She had the grades to get into law school, but decided to take a year off first, and wound up running a high stakes poker game in Los Angeles. Early in the movie, we see Molly taking on the services of Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), one of those incorruptible lawyers movies are so good at providing. (Film shorthand: He got a sweet school age daughter so we know he on the level.) He urges her to turn on her former clients in exchange for a lighter sentence, but she has principles too!

A) My making of an Atheist post does not necessarily bring with it a contempt for Christianity or any other religion, for that matter. Such thinking is generally "perpetuated" by the religious, who often by virtue of their own belief system, must have polar opposites; black and white, good and evil, yin and yang. Such things are the very basis for the constrictive, cognitive dissonance that is much of the "holy books" or scripture. This lends to a tendency of the religious to immediately come to bear on the opinions of others, despite the zealots actions being borne of insecurity, dogma and in general: vanity (It a sin, dontcha know).

Taking physical care of herself is also important. Adequate food and rest are essential, but the symptoms of the depression may make it harder to eat and sleep. All new mothers, not just those who suffer from PND, should make use of all the friends and relatives popping in to see the baby   by getting them to make ther own drinks or snacks, and getting her one while they're at it! Or by asking them to help with the chores. They should also accept that sleep is more important than housework, and catch a few minutes whenever the baby naps rather than trying to keep the place spotless. The partner may be able to take responsibility for one night time or early morning feed, leaving the mother to catch up on her sleep. It is all too easy to leave meals untouched due to a screaming baby, or to nibble at snack foods all day rather than keeping a balanced diet, but a new mother, especially if she is breast feeding, needs to keep well nourished. It is a very difficult lesson to learn, but a crying baby really will not be hurt by waiting five minutes while you finish your dinner.

Wow. so many people saying the mother shouldn need to do this and it okay for the baby to cry. have you flown a 10+ hour flight with babies screaming all the time? Or unruly children running around and banging seats while their parents ignore them? Fuck it hell. flying in a cramped plane where you can see, hear, and smell everything is already bad enough. I understand that babies are going to travel, but some parents aren able to keep them quiet or if the baby can properly equalize the pressure, may cry for the majority of the flight. It nice that this women did this, and like the poster, I sure many people are appreciative and will be extra understanding if the baby does start crying. This is just good manners, and it a shame that a lot of people don see the need for this in the world anymore.
