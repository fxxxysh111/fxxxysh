Goodness? Godly? Good gods. At this point, the disconnect between reality and policy is so great, the continuation of Dubbya religious war so clear, that it is impossible to assume President Obama is anything but the most cynical of men. Because unlike Dubbya, who actually believed crazy Christian talk about bringing "goodness/godliness" by killing, Obama is far too smart to believe such stupid things. 
Now, if i am playing with your chips and checking out your opponent out of the corner of my eye (which works even better if you're wearing sunglasses like many of the pros do), he or she may not pick up on it and will give something away. It goes back to the distraction/intimidation factor.

Generally, I'd say it can't hurt to reach out and try to run a new score; my previous company would apply the new one if it improved and keep the old one if it had gone down.

It has never been illegal to ingest weed or be intoxicated by it. It is/was illegal to possess it or sell it. If you want to be petty and pedantic and argue that they were perhaps committing a crime by briefly being in possession of a controlled substance during the act of ingesting it, then make the false equivalence that it exactly the same as the egregious shit Trump is suspected of, then use that as a red herring to avoid talking about Trump, that your perogative.
So, we've explained what the procedure looks like   assuming it was done properly. And as you could probably guess there are a lot of ways an amateur or first timer can get it wrong. It's different than most other car repairs because it's not about mechanical prowess; it's more about control and the ability to maintain a steady hand and a gentle pace. You can't rush it. The problem is, once a sheet metal repair starts to go awry, you're usually much, much worse off than if you'd just left it alone. Metal holds its shape, but only to a certain point.

Its not too much of a stretch to me that there would be anti vaxxers hosting communities on there. It does boast communities for everything via YouTuber ads.

1.) Because you are causing a major disruption in the flow of the game and also disrupting the order of the cards coming out from the deck you have to ask permission from the floor supervisor and he going to inform the desk that you need to take a piss break. Also the floor guy will have to tell the dealer to modify the shuffle procedure so that the order of the cards is not disturbed by your departure.

In Kwan book, Rachel is Chinese American, raised by an immigrant single mom with decidedly American values. Her boyfriend Nick Young is the scion of a Singaporean family that is described as than God. When Rachel goes to the Southeast Asian country to meet Nick relatives for the first time, she exposed to a world of privilege unlike anything she ever seen. While the stories may seem outlandish, the details are from Kwan own life. He drew on his upbringing as a member of one of Singapore wealthy families, his experience as an immigrant kid in suburban Houston and his observations of his friends and relatives during visits to Asia as they became even richer.

The Wanderers were ending their season by making their 2nd trip to Dorset to defend the Challenge trophy that they had won at the Commercial at the beginning of March. It was decided that this would be a proper end of season thrash so we would all meet up early and make a day of it.

My neighbour was a dick, always fighting over which land and he was always wrong.

Standard booster packs are going to be the best value money wise. If you are looking to resell later or just want packs for singles or kitchen table limited, then you are in luck. Using the 10 tix = $2 rule, everything else is pretty overpriced. Last GP I was at Teferi was like 360 tix so you could get that card or a box of DOM. Some mid tier singles ($2 10) are decently priced if you just need a card but you are still paying a moderate prizewall tax.

Even if Japan can achieve a 1% inflation target, that would be a great achievement. In the past 15 years, the central bank and government administrations failed to achieve that. I am confident that Japan will turn its deflation into inflation of 1%, though I am not sure Japan can achieve 2%.

There no reason to bet large on the flop in hand 1.

Bet half pot or even less on flop, possibly turn depending on how good it is, and hope to get called by trash.

If you have tried your luck with one slot machine and have not achieved anything, try the following machine because casinos generally place winning slots alternately. Two good paying slots are never arranged next to one another. Another thing that you must keep in mind is that you must never stick to only one slot machine. If one machine has produced a high payout, it is time you go for another slot because the same machine may make you a loser.

The term "Manure spreader" according to the OED comes into use around 1884, 55 years after this report except of course this is called a manure "scatterer" which seems to imply less confidence than a "spreader:, though that may have come about due to the modesty of the inventor. First I thought it would be related to an article on the depiction of motion as the drawing seemed to represent the anatomy of two dancers, and have some sort of fourth dimension/art/science relation, or whathaveyou, but then I saw it was a schematic for a part of motion picture camera a kinematograph/cinematograph that made 180 images per second, and would be just the sort of instrument used to study fast moving objects in minute detail. So the schematic really did portray the essence of what the machine did, exploring the designs of motion..

The discussion on legality of online poker sites is really interesting. Basically, the section of gambling is managed by each individual state; thereby some states legalized gambling while other state does not. There is no solid reasons to say that gambling is legal, illegal or none of the above, the answer can be yes, no or maybe. If you are so much concerned about this legality issue, you must be keen to get new information on the subject, or you can avoid playing the game altogether since, you won be able to enjoy the game if you are worried about this issue all the time.

H2G21 was intended to be the Earth edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the fictional tome at the heart of Douglas Adams' galactically successful radio series and books. Before the site became a reality, Douglas said that his original idea was for "a collaborative guide, one that was written and kept up to date by the people who use it, in real time". He remarked that at the time he didn't realise that such a thing could be possible, or how powerful a networked community working together to the same end could be. (You can read more about this in an Entry written by Douglas called My Vision for H2G2.)

It is puzzling to me too. On its head, the school seems pretty obviously like it wouldn appeal to conservatives. While it is an ivy league, which inherently gives it a reputation as prestigious, exclusionary, white, and coastal elite y, a lot of the other qualities would turn people off. First, being a land grant school really differentiates it, and that concept seems like something conservatives would want to avoid. And having our relatively unique labor relations school should just be a big red flag if you a conservative. (Although I do know conservatives in that school).

If instead of 7 the turn comes down a K, then it is not looking so good now because some one (maybe you) may have paired Ks on the flop; so they are more likely to fold Js or 7s, if you betted/bluffed as if you may now have a pair of Kings. Then if they fold, you take the pot without a showdown.

The classic example is that of drawing to a flush   if in a particular hand you have a 1 in 4 chance of making your flush with the remaining card to be dealt, and that would give you the best hand, then you should not continue unless you will be getting the proper odds (direct and implied).

At the age of 27, he was playing basketball and was hit hard in the head and knocked out. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because when they looked at his brain for concussion evidence, they found malignant brain cancer. They gave him 9 months to live. That was 20 years ago. In about three months, he was deeply inspired into running, and was soon running marathons and doing triathlons. Three more months, the doctors called him in for another look at his brain, and discovered that the cancer was rapidly decreasing. It was soon completely gone! They released him. Michael, more shocked than the doctors were, started something called "Team Michael Moyles" (still exists today!) and partnered with LiveStrong. But the cancer came back. They gave him 3 years to live. Three years passed, he was still alive and kicking, and then, a month into the fourth year, it wanished. This happened two more times. And during all of this, he:

Lie on the floor or a bed with your arms near your sides and your legs slightly parted. Relax your entire body by letting it sink into the floor or bed. Breathe in slowly through your nose, and pull the air deeply into your lungs until you feel your abdomen rise. Slowly exhale. Be attentive to how your body feels as you breathe in and out. After two or three deep breaths, raise your hands above your head and stretch as if you were trying to touch the ceiling. Continue breathing while you stretch. Be attentive to how your body and your mind feel as you breathe. Stretch your whole body upward. Exhale slowly as you bring your arms back down to your sides and lower your heels to the floor. Repeat one or two more times.

Fallout 2 was my first introduction to an Open World type of game. I remember picking it up when I was a lot younger and I really did not fully understand what I was supposed to do out the gate. Once I got to the first settlement outside of the Vault / Tribe I got frustrated talking to NPCs when suddenly found out that I could just attack the townspeople. Being young and immature that was exactly what I did. I quickly got taken down by Sheriff and other armed townsfolk but it was mindblowing to be able to walk up to pretty much any character and be able to attack, pickpocket, or just talk to them.

Texas Hold is a popular form of poker made even more popular when televised poker became a 10 or so years ago. The idea is to put your hand together using two cards only you can see and use, with five cards everyone else can see and use. As each new card that everyone can see and use is turned over, a new round of betting takes place. What ends up happening is new opportunities, strategies, and techniques become available with each new round, while old hopes, plans, or strategies become no longer open to you.
I used to play a lot of wraith I used it to help "sneak" my enemies across open areas. If we were worried about people trying to shoot us, I would set up the portal, run to a building or another safe spot, and put the portal down to help the rest of my squad get into a better position without putting them in danger. Sure, they would see me and could probably guess what I was doing, but that doesn change the fact that my teammates would be able to get inside a building or in a better position without risking any health or shields. 
Yep, sounds like anxiety to me! I tried to limit my own anxiety when anticipating anxiety filled activities by distracting myself away from it unless it something I am literally about to do what in the next 5 minutes. You just have to rationally tell yourself constantly that there is no benefit to you obsessing mentally over doing something that you don have to do it this very minute because you are really exerting negative energy and anxiety driven energy on simply thinking! And then it like a Snowball Effect, you start worrying about doing it and then you worried grows and grows and then it starts turning into psychosomatic symptoms that physically will affect your body and cause an anxiety attack..

They want to introduce us to the basics of the story, the alien races we will encounter, the game play and the worlds for us to explore (which can still be done without giving away too much)..

Overall looks very solid. A couple things to work on that I think all tie in together. As already mentioned, your elbows are pretty high/flared. Looks like this is due to your shoulder position being rolled forward, you want those shoulders down and back when setting up and then pull the bar down into your traps/back during the lift to create that stable shelf. This should give you a better upper body position that may be slightly more upright which leads into the second thing. Your have some hip shift back immediately out of the hole and your hips then rise before your chest does. You can see this is the side view that once you come out of the hole your knees shift back and your hips come up. You can also see the weight in your feet shift back to your heels which may be due to that hip shift but is also probably causing some of it.

But the pressure for negative interest rates to drive cash out of bank deposits and into the economy is building.

But how much longer will banks eat that before adding fees and charges to Swiss accounts to defray the cost?
There is now doubt that the plane was huge 112' long, 22' high, with a wingspan of 206' (and 5,200 sq ft surface area), and weighed in at 59 tons and was indeed the largest plane in the world. It was built very quickly, and it showed; it offered nothing new so far as design is concerned, being a cobbled montage of existing blueprints.

Data breaches are often associated with large businesses, but charities are also susceptible to being targets.
There are a number of research organisations within the effective altruism community dedicated to figuring out which interventions/charities are the most effective.

But as long as universities and the ruling elites of our culture prove our own fitness to rule through the fitness of our youth, as long as sporting culture is not just for fun and fitness, but for scholarships and future jobs, the brogeoisie will have to man up and pay the price. Sadly, the young women and young men who are used to prove their manliness  the bitches and the fags who are screamed at and threatened, beaten, raped and even murdered  will have to pay an even higher price..

The chain is budgeting between $20 million and $25 million on the media for the new push, more than previous efforts which cost between $16 million and $20 million, Collins says.
It was weird, because as I reached my ideal weight and fitness goals, my problem areas shifted. Suddenly I was very concerned about my assymmetrical ribcage, my "weird" jawline, and whether or not my shoulders were "too broad." Even if you satisfied aesthetically, there are always going to be fitness goals   running a marathon, a tricky yoga position, a personal best squat weight   that elude you.

MeditationMeditation is a classic relaxation technique. It's relatively simple, can be extremely effective, and is very useful for calming the mind more than the body   which is particularly good when dealing with exams, stressful working environments and so forth. At face value, it appears that you're doing nothing   how difficult can that be? To begin with, sit quietly in silence and concentrate on your breathing. Try to think of nothing. Spend some time like this, and after a while you'll feel relaxed.

When an animal is stressed, watch for it trying to chew on bars or doing other weird shit. Stereotype behavoir is THE way to see if an animal is stressed or not. If the chronic stress continues on long enough, they start disassociating with reality and they have very delayed or no responses at all to things that should elicit responses..

For someone who seems so pro GTO such as Berkey, I find it hard for him to have a single hand in his range better than what he holding. If you folding close to 100% of your range in this spot (I guess you can have some AJ/A9 combos), you become very exploitable.

That is why Trump handing over his business to his children is absolutely not a blind trust. Even if we can believe that they won't communicate with their father on what's at stake, they have incentive to better him off, and so manipulate it. But hey, the president isn't required to do so anyway, so rules broken, just misinformed people.
With only 21 days until the state election, voters can demand our politicians do more to protect communities from gambling harm. Prevention initiatives are critical.

Listen, I know you don't want to hear "break up", but it's legit your only choice. You will either have no kid and he grows resentment/try to sabotage your birth control (which has happened on this sub) or you do and you're not only miserable, but you possibly take it out on the kid after sleep deprivation and a possible divorce anyway. You two want very different things, it's unfair to ask him to give up his dream to have children just like it's unfair for him to ask that of you when you don't want to. It's hard, but it's the only way you will be happy. Take it as a lesson to learn, make your intentions up front with any new partner and say you won't change, if they keep pressuring you leave. You both deserve to be happy, don't you think?

Hallucinations like OP described typically come from severe alcohol withdrawal, which you can expect from heavy daily alcohol intake. Hitting the alcohol hard only on "most weekends" in all likelihood does not add up over time to produce hallucinations. When someone binge drinks on weekends they may have some shakiness and anxiety on Monday (I sure many of us have experienced this), but the brain typically has enough time to recalibrate throughout the week and never fully adjusts to relying on alcohol to maintain its neurochemical balance.

Okay, so much for the whole "our culture is similarly oppressive to women as theirs" speech. It not that I unaware of Afghani patriarchy. Long before George Dubbya cared about the plight of Afghan women, I was part of a network of academics and activists trying to bring the plight of women under the Taliban to the attention of Western policy makers. And the family, the murderous father, mother, and brother, were not exactly assimilated into Montreal life. Despite apparent economic success here (they were building a $900,000 home and drove a Lexus SUV), the parents speak neither English nor French and are probably fairly confused about what they did wrong since honor killings are right in much of Afghanistan.

But this is a solid point, and we consider it next time we do this. We committed right now to putting the rules to vote yearly, so there will be another opportunity (and more in the future).Another thing is that the questions should have straight yes or no options without this ranking thing. It was confusing to figure out.The reason we use the ranked choice system for some questions is that we want to make sure people have the chance to pick from a variety of options, rather than having to pick between just two when the situation (and people preferences) are more complex.

After the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, I shut it down for a few weeks to give myself a bit of recovery, only running to help maintain my base (and because I like running way too much to completely stop it's impossible for me)! I picked it back up afterwards and started my build, mostly running road due to snow hitting the Canadian Rockies (it's tough to hit my pace targets while slogging through the snowy trails). I focused more on speed while building back to a peak week of 145km. The plan for the San Tan Scramble 50k was to use it as training for my upcoming A race, the Black Canyon 100k (hunting for a WSER Golden Ticket). I figured a desert race 1.5 months in advance by the same race organizer as the BC100 would be a perfect way to get my feet wet in 2019 and get that confidence up. Unfortunately, a week before the race I pulled my hamstring and shut things down almost completely, hoping that it would heal in time for the race. I was very worried, but knew that the hay was in the barn and rest was much more important than trying to go through a standard taper.

I think the rhyming thing is great advice. One day about 4 years ago, I just said fuck it, I not gonna worry about rhyming a damn thing in this song. And it turned out really well.

If rhyming compliments the words/song, then I use it. If it doesn I don try to force it. Just sorta depends on what suits the song best, which is basically the number 1 rule of songwriting.

We know that bias against older people has already found its way into medicine. Reuben et al[1] found that medical students had "already formed some unfavorable attitudes about older persons," and were less likely to admit an acutely ill 85 year old to an intensive care unit and aggressively treat her than a 10 year old with chronic leukemia. These students could rightly justify offering medical treatments to patients with malignant diseases who have one or two years of life expectancy, but worryingly were hesitant to extend treatment to so called "elderly" patients with benign diseases who were likely to have an even longer life expectancy.
