On the weekends i play cash games with some friends of mine, Usually we are laid back and chill. first hand of our game he dealing but i noticed some sketchy shit before the hand, he was holding the cards and my other friend apparently saw him going through the cards. I then saw him mess up the shuffle ( should called him out there but i wanted to truly see if he was cheating). I like to note he is a pretty decent player, hand comes out i have pocket 8s and bet $5 pre flop, the supposed cheater had pocket queens and called, other friend in pot had pocket 6s, flop comes Q68 at this point when he bet 10 i knew something was sketchy i fold, my friend didn and lost quite a bit. two things that make this 100% more suspicious when i folded i made sure to stare at him while i did it to see his reaction, he looked pretty confused. Oh and the cherry on top he owed someone some money and was hoping to get it from this game.

The thing that frustrates me about this is that eating disorders don just manifest in people that are underweight because eating disorders are not just anorexia. Often times eating disorders like bulimia and binge eating disorder (BED) are present in people who are average or overweight, or even obese if the BED is bad enough. NEDA needs to promote recovering from all eating disorders, which for some people (who have BED and bulimia) can actually result in weight loss because they are no longer binging.

Your weapons are strong, and can quickly kill the flagship as is, however killing the crew can make it safer in phase 2 and 3.

PoE definitely has more depth but id dare say that to the average person, diablo 3s loot system is much more satisfying. Stuff like completing sets or items that make a certain skill (that you didn really like that much before) 17 times stronger really mix up the gameplay during progression at least. It also way more straightforward with usually less modifiers to consider and the game does a MUCH better job at signalling what is strong or good to use, whereas in PoE you basically have to read 15 pages of a guide to get a gist of what going on.

It takes time to believe it. It totally normal to grieve the fantasy of a mother. You finally realized that fantasy will not come true, but the grief is real. Let it be. Grieve. Allow yourself to be open to your true emotions, without judgement, without disdain, without impatience. Just be. The feeling of not being hurt every day is really amazing. The grief and pain are also really amazing, but they shorter lived. When your mom is abusive, it like living in a forest that is catching fire. At some point the blaze is so big, and the spaces you though you could be safe just are not anymore, You lose hope of the fire dying down and just having a lovely forest.

But there IS fresh, open skies outside. You get there. I happy for you making this change and I hoping you have access to a counselor. The disappointment and grief are things we need to say out loud.

The economic dislocation beginning in the 1980s and 1990s began the slow, inevitable process of not only wearing down our communities, but splintering them as well. We began losing key parts of our cohesiveness as a mid sized city, but the greatest loss of all was jobs, the meaningful, well paying kind. As the transformation of society continues, the decline of that meaningful work has left in its wake increased poverty, a number of crises, including the lack of affordable housing, and the loss of worth..

P hacking is a broad term that covers a variety of dubious statistical techniques. I recommend reading A Garden of Forking Paths. by Andrew Gelman, which delves into some of the more esoteric methods of "p hacking". You describe p hacking as testing multiple interactions without merit. This indeed is a type of p hacking, but this is only one of many ways to p hack. One example is arbitrarily removing data points to massage a p value. A second example would be performing multiple types of statistical tests on data, and picking the one that provides significance.

Tight/Weak  Tight/weak players usually have a fairly good idea of proper starting hand selection and stick to it. They rarely raise unless they have the absolute best hand, and they prefer to check and call to see what is coming next. The biggest problem with this type of play is that tight/weak players rarely protect their hand (by betting or raising to narrow the field) and are often beat by a player who hits a draw or miracle card.

Does anyone have any good resources on overbetting strategy or just a bet sizing in general? I ran a bunch of different pio sims and I still can't figure out exactly when it likes overbetting and when it doesn't. In general there seems to be a correlation between our equity range vs range and likelihood of overbetting but there are a lot of exceptions and I'm just not seeing the pattern fully. With the ranges I assigned in one hand, Pio bet flop overbet turn IP on Th6h2d  offsuit 2 or 3 on the turn but did not overbet on an offsuit A turn when the A is even better for our equity than the 2 or 3. Does it have to do with not having enough high equity bluffs if V turned an A? I'm kind of lost.
Not even remotely true. For example, The International 8 had a prizepool of $25.5 million, which represents 25% of what players spent on the battlepass.

That is because these essential fatty acids are not present in a lot of Omega 3 products.Flaxseed contains alpha linolenic acid, which your body has to convert to DHA and EPA.For the elderly this conversion process does NOT work very well.Itis estimated that most adults would have to consume 10   40 grams of flaxseed oil to produce just 0.2 grams of DHA.So, if you want to get the proven benefits of DHAdon'trely on getting your Omega 3s from vegetable oils such as flaxseed.There is however now some products being produced from algae which contain good levels of DHA and do not require the body to convert the ALA to the DHA. But, they are still not readily available and they are very expensive.The best source of DHA is from fish oil. However, there are some drawbacks with many fish oils:The amount of DHA is low in most fish oils.

By the mid 1990s, a revolution in trading had occurred; the old school grizzled traders had been replaced by a new breed of quantitative analysts, applying mathematics to the "art" of trading and making of it a science. Similarly in poker, for decades, the highest level of pokers have been dominated by players who have learned the game by playing it, "road gamblers" who have cultivated intuition for the game and are adept at reading other players' hands from betting patterns and physical tells.

I don understand your question regarding patterns. If you "often" don know why a good move looks/feels good, then you need to analyse these more.

The improvement will be that more classes (hopefully all) will be included in end game content. At this time Paladins and Clerics are dominating end game as heavy buffers and dominating the content, pretty much ignoring the battle mechanics that regular players have to deal with. One simple change is removing "power sharing" from the Clerics and Paladins, which is what is making their steamrolling possible. It not an exploit but the benefits of it are on that level. That creates a "only one way to end game" attitude, which will eventually kill any game unless it is addressed.

That why it actually not very surprising that British Celtic imparted only about ten loanwords into English, but also why it very surprising that there is an absolute lack of Celtic influence on Old English syntax and sound system. This is likely because the British Celtic languages were regarded as very low prestige dialects spoken by marginal people with the lowest social status between the onset of Anglo Saxon colonisation and the Norman Conquest. The Norman Conquest is significant because the introduction of a new, Norman, ruling elite upset the previous binary between British Celtic and Anglo Saxon languages; there is indeed evidence of Celtic influence on the Middle English language which was made possible by English reduction in prestige, being replaced by Norman French.

I went to Japan and had to talk to people and look up information and take classes in English. Living in Japan, in regular life, I use English plenty more than Japanese.

What I still have to think about sometimes is where one word ends in a consonant sound, but the next word begins in a very different consonant sound so they carry the final sound from the first word over into the next word like 2NE1 song I am the best     you would think the last two words are pronounced like they written, but actually they bring the  over so it is pronounced.

Expansion Goals Some massage business owners will want to set goals to help them expand their business. These expansion goals might relate to growing the business so that it can hire additional massage therapists and add massage treatment rooms. Other forms of expansion goals can focus on expanding the type of massage treatments offered to guests. One example of this form of goal might be "research authentic Eastern massage techniques" or "become certified in two new massage techniques and add them to the treatment menu."

Professional pet sitters care for pets in the pets' own homes, giving them water, food, and attention once or twice daily for about an hour at a time while their owners are away. Holidays and summer months are the busiest seasons, with early morning and late evening hours typical for these pet jobs, says Ali O'Connor, a pet sitter and owner of Inko's Exemplary Pet Care Services in Naples, Fla. O'Connor charges $35 per hour and more for pets who have special needs and sits for five to 25 pets per week. After barely breaking even her first two years, O'Connor made $32,000 last year working "full throttle."Because you are entering someone's home and are responsible for the pet 24/7 while owners are away, O'Connor strongly recommends pet sitting insurance and bonding. Others costs include a reliable car, gas, pet treats and toys.

Sometimes at the 2 Point we experience some sort of issue in the body. There is an emotional content that registers within us and it can sometimes be life threatening. The 4 Point is a "lived experience" that is tantamount to feeling like a living speed bag that boxers train on [insert the sound of leather gloves hitting a leather bag on a pivot in rapid succession duhduhduh duhduhduh etc.] and the sense of life shattering on us like a knockout punch from god to a weakened jaw. The 6 Point is a point of crystallization, when we make it through the "asteroid belt" between the 4 point and 5 point, we accelerate up to the 6 point only to hit a wall that forces a dramatic shift. At this point it is time to prepare, and learn for the remaining 3 years of the 9 year cycle, for what will emerge in the next round.

When I heard Gabi Zijderveld, chief marketing officer of emotion measurement technology company Affectiva, describe writing 44 handwritten thank you notes at a conference she'd organized, my interest was peaked.

Nine or ten players is customary in Omaha high low split, which has a rotating blind system (meaning for every hand, a certain player must contribute a set amount of money to start the betting). Usually a score of eight or better is placed on the low hand, and the best high hand will split the pot with the best low hand. This means for a hand to qualify as a low, it must have five cards not paired that are ranked eight or lower. Then three community cards are dealt face up in the center of the table. These cards are called the "flop." Another card is dealt face up, which is called the "turn," followed by the last card being dealt face up, called the "river." Rounds of betting are before the flop, after the flop, after the turn, and after the river.

To why the preference of yoyo to kendama, I personally feel that yoyo is more expressive that kendama. Kendama becomes a lot of rote repetition, and a lot of the higher level tricks are simply, trick you been doing, but with more spins Not that it easy to add those extra spins, it can just become less exciting as time goes on, I think. I know that an oversimplification of it, but I guess I feel like the number of to be performed with yoyo are just so much greater than kendama (at least from what I personally seen).

0My background is i have been playing poker for recreation and small stakes for a little under 10 years, Whenever i used to go to jail (often) I played cash games everyday in order to eat, And can only remember 3 5 times i left the table below what i entered with. My game play is looser at home games because it is with friends and drinking, So i would say my win/loss is about 50:50 at home games. My online WSOP account is 25m the second highest of my 900 facebook friends, and the only time i played at the casino i more than doubled my money. My recent success at the casino coupled with the fact that i consistently won at the table in jail makes me want to pursue it as a secondary/supplemental income. The success playing in jail really is a major factor in my confidence since it was 8 hours a day at the table with cash stakes playing against other people who did the same thing, 8 hours a day at the cash stakes table, for upwards of 1 year, while walking away less than flush 5 or less times. And yes, i was very impulsive when it came to drugs but when sober, poker has never been a problem when it comes to impulse control. Like i said in another reply, i intend to exclusively stick to 1$/2$ blinds hold em and enter in to it with a 600$/300bb bankroll in order to be able to have a safe buffer against runs of bad cards and potentially getting bled by blinds.

The period of instability and division continued when the Viking raids became more serious. In 1002, thelweard, Ealdorman of Southwest England, died, yet the title of Ealdorman was not passed on and the area was being governed by shire reeves alone. thelweard's son thelmaer, who would have been expected to inherit the title, later defected to Swein with considerable force. Other men in powerful positions were exiled, such as lfric of Mercia, Leofsige of Essex and Wulfgeat. By weakening and removing the power of those around him, thelred effectively removed many of those with power possibly capable of acting against the Viking invaders. thelred's willingness to exile and execute people he considered traitors may well explain why Wulfnoth was more willing to turn pirate and desert his king than to try and defend himself against accusations of treachery. This treatment of men in power could not fail to weaken England and this was a powerful contribution to why thelred's kingdom was so easily conquered.
