I work at a doctor office and this one time a patient came in and demanded that we switch the waiting room TV to Fox news. I told him we only had basic channels and not the cables and he was flabbergasted, like he couldn comprehend that there were people who didn get/watch Fox News. He then got upset that we had PBS news on so I had to switch the channel to some Judge Judy knockoff show. I guess some people can stand not watching batshit crazy propaganda for the fifteen minutes they in the waiting room. It was sad, really.
Even Taxis are not very expensive. Ask the Hotel when you check in as they provide you with the shuttle service and times to the beaches and nearby malls. Use the Metro for getting to the malls   I prefer the metro as it is easier and quicker to manage.

Reflexology is a spa treatment where the therapist works on "reflex points" on your feet, hands, and head (especially ears).

It curious that running bamboo grows far larger in the sun, while those planted in the shade tend to stay smaller. The opposite is true of clumping types; planted in hot sun, they tend to stay far more compact, and in shade they grow far larger and more vigorously.

For the most part, I think the homeless population goes unnoticed. Of course you notice the guy soliciting change on the corner, but so many more are practically invisible. I pointed out the tent cities, or the man slumped over a table at 11pm in the 24 hour grocery store, to my husband and he didn even realize they were there. He didn even know about the shelter until he asked why one particular gas station near us seemed to host more people standing on the corner asking for money. I explained that the homeless shelter was just across the street, and, other than the grocery store, this was their only quick, easy, nearby option for food (or booze or cigarettes). In fact, now that I look for them, I recognize some of them and it really gets to you when one day, you don see them at their usual haunts. I know of at least one who died on the streets, literally.

In general, game theory is a theory of social situations: how intelligent individuals interact with one another in an effort to achieve their own goals (whether those goals coincide or conflict). It started as a study of card games (poker, in particular), but became progressively more central to business, policy and political decisions.

The 34 year old quarterback is the ultimate trifecta when it comes to representing a club both in the community and on a national scale: He got the looks to be their face; he got the personality and wits to act as their voice; and he backs it all up on the field by being the best player in the Canadian Football League.

But if I skip one night, I be bright red by 4pm the next day, no matter what else I do.

You heavily stepping into music therapy and if that something you want to continue doing in your practice, you should look into getting training. I assuming you have a masters degree? There are equivalency programs that are shorter than getting a full blown degree in music therapy and I think people with backgrounds like yours are ideal candidates. I also would recommend against calling it a music group; maybe something more like music guided mindfulness? That would at least seem less music therapy ish and more therapeutic use of music..

Aurilia pinch hits for Ishikawa: Anyone else think it was odd for Bruce Bochy to pinch hit for Travis Ishikawa that early in the game on Sunday? I mean it was the 4th inning. To refresh your memory, the Giants were down 3 1. The Giants just loaded the bases with no outs, and Padres manager Bud Black just replaced right handed starter Josh Banks for lefty Justin Hampson.

My experience with such things is limited to interpreting reddit comments, but I think a while ago people were going through a phase where everyone was talking about anal sex (man to woman) and then the next "new normal" was men getting penetrated with dildos.

I'm a mom of two in a stable, married relationship. Leave. Save yourself. She may be a great person/smoking hot/out of your league, but she isn't likely great enough for anyone, including you, to sacrifice their twenties and thirties for (as well as the dreams you might have of having stable minded kids of your own). Be prepared, though, for her to raise hell if you try to back out. She is probably feeling lucky as hell to have found you (since no other guy would likely tolerate even a fraction of what you have) and when she knows she's about to lose you, there may be no limits to what she says or does to keep you around. She may guilt you. She may threaten you. She may say things to undercut your confidence and try to make you think that she's the best you'll be able to get. It may be subversive and manipulative, or it may be overt   but just be prepared! I have seen single moms in this situation and shit can get crazy when the BF tries to leave. Seriously, get out, and watch yourself. Good luck.

Arguably one of the most moronic things I've ever heard. If he is 5'7 he will likely get smoked by >99% of the people in the NBA and this is coming from someone who trained BJJ for 8 years and competed at a high level.

The Moon has a vast array of vegetable life but comparatively little animal life. There are three reptilian species. The first are flying reptiles, the second, called a rympth, is a four legged snake that prefers to slither rather than use its primitive limbs and finally there is a lion like reptile called the tor ho. All three are heavily poisonous, both through using venom on their prey when attacking and through being too poisonous to eat. In fact all non poisonous animals on the Moon have been hunted to extinction. The Moon is called Va nah by its inhabitants who once lived on the surface but moved into the Moon's interior when the outer atmosphere became too thin to breathe. Despite their legends of the surface, most believe that the universe, except for Va nah, is solid rock.

In 1891, Poker Alice moved her operations to Arizona dealing cards at the Midway, the El Moro, and the Blue Goose in Clifton. Then when the silver miners flocked to Colorado's San Juan Mountains, she pulled up stakes and headed to Creede. There she worked a faro table six days a week (she never worked on Sunday) at Ford's Exchange, a saloon and dancehall. The owner, Bob Ford, was none other than the man who had wasted Jesse James in 1882. A few weeks after Poker Alice went to work for Ford, Edward O'Kelley entered Ford's tent saloon on June 8, 1892, with a 10 gauge shotgun. According to witnesses, Ford's back was turned. O'Kelley said, "Hello, Bob." As Ford turned to see who it was, O'Kelley emptied both barrels into his midsection, killing Ford instantly. So much for the "dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard."

One can argue that it is because of this vagueness in the constitution and in the law, that China is able to become an economic world power in such a short time.

Overall, I think these changes are positive and a step in the right direction, especially the purge/pw:s change. That said, I think several more changes need to be made.

This is a little hard to convey via text, but the ruling should be that any and all chips that cross the betting line (in this case invisible) are considered a bet, and once chips cross the line, obviously no more can enter the pot.

So the day starts, and the management area is flooded with protesters walking up and down all the trails, banging pots and pans, blowing whistles, air horns, the whole 9 yards, to try and scare the deer. These idiots have no idea that all they are doing is jumping deer from spot to spot, keeping them on their feet. Most hunters that morning shot a buck. My buddy goes back to the check station with his and another guy bucks in the back of the truck. Other guys there with their deer, and loads of protesters , with the wardens doing a fine job of keeping them separate. Said buddy walks up and starts shaking the hands and thanking all the protesters for all their hard work to keep the deer moving that morning, everyone was shooting bucks because of them.

This was quickly put right on the fifth hand as 9's each from Billy Food Chain and a 13 spare from Skipper Hake helped to a 65 hand and regain 8 pins back to now lead by 22. A sixth hand 60 seemed to be a holding hand, but Naps then found some form and hit their highest hand of the night of 70 to pull ten pins and cut our lead to 12.

Det er en interessant samtale. Mitt skrblikk er selvflgelig farget av jeg selv er mann og far, og jeg merker meg at kvinner rundt dette temaet faktisk fr lov til  vre skikkelig etisk tvilsomme.

It is locked to canonical repository, there was a way to add third party repositories that wasn really usable (to the point i would say in practice there is no way to add them), and it got removed. Also the server side code is closed source (therefore, vendor locked to canonical). This isn surprising because this is not the first time they are doing it (Ubuntu one server side code is still closed source), and they appear to want to have a "app store" business model, as you can see in their developer agreements:.

I come to feel like SAM is best described as understanding the relationship between your time remaining on each of your buffs and your debuffs and how that dictates which of your 5 or 6 attack paths to take first and how that further affects your future attack paths 20 seconds from now. Then learning that pattern for each fight/raid as their scripted timing will each be different, affecting your timings.

Those kids need therapy(abusive, addict father who abandoned them, messy parental split, moved around a lot   look up ACE tests, they aren everything but higher scores tend to be a sign of more trauma). Until that can happen they need as many good people around them as they can. The easiest way to explain about talking to some adults and not others is let her know that it isn Grandma Crazy business. The little girl mom knows   that who matters. Mom is the one you don keep secrets from. Grandma may have GPR but that isn the same as being a parent. Suggestion to bio mom for getting kids into therapy is meet evil MIL at their pediatrician office   tell the pediatrician about dad history the 911 call, DR should be on board with therapy, MIL can argue in front of the doctor or she look right crazy, so kids get therapy. Getting therapy is in the best interests of the kids and if she fights it at least it is good fodder to show a judge later on, showing that she doesn have their best interests at heart. So that is sort of win/win.

The combination of this, and the multiplication effect on the game tree, make it not that appealing for people not playing for money to get into botting.

Several newspapers have reported that money from the Mississippi casinos may have made its way to Alabama and into the hands of John Giles.

Clothing, Footwear and Equipment   This risk factor is based on how suitable the equipment is in training and competition situations. If an individual is wearing incorrect footwear then their foot or ankle will not be protected effectively and forces placed on these areas will not be displaced efficiently increasing this person's risk of injury. For example, if a football player is wearing running shoes on a wet, slippery football pitch instead of the correct football boots then they are going to slip over. 
When we hired two new people who were on her level, she had a long talk with me about how I needed to start concentrating on doing work for them. Her reasoning was that it was important to impress them, it was important to get exposed to different facets of our job, and as the junior person I needed to be available to help everyone, and I should focus more on them. So naturally they piled on assignments and I was splitting my time three ways. Shortly after our "Work with everyone" talk my manager slammed my door closed and started berating me for not focusing enough on her and the assignments that she was giving me. When I apologized and said some of her assignments didn have due dates or external deadlines so I was making them a lower priority, she scoffed and said "I your manager. You should be focusing on me." Any time she complimented my hair, blazer, or dress she was really effusive about it and I began to figure out that when she did that, at some point during the day we were going to have a talk about what I had done to displease her. (The "That is the ugliest effing skirt I have ever seen" Mean Girls scene comes to mind.) I walked on eggshells around her because one day I would be doing everything "great" and the next day she would be displeased with the way I did anything at all.

Its pathetic how westerners, presumably males, who probably never seriously gave 2 shits about feminism or womens rights suddenly get defensive when it comes to "ownership" of feminism, and talk over ACTUAL female feminist scholars in claiming who it revolves around.

It especially heartbreaking when you look into the leading theories of what happened to Thomas. Whether the sheriff actually had a hand in the events that lead to Thomas death or he is just not investigating the matter as hard as he could, some people (myself included) think the sheriff knows more about that night than he is letting on because he still held a grudge against Thomas for the interaction they had before he was sheriff. And when you look at the sheriff actions in handling the investigation it really makes you wonder what his motives are.
But Linux is lovely. Try out some of the distributions and desktop environments (I had perversely used Cinnamon themed to look like Windows XP because it amused me for a while: there are OSX like themes out there like Elementary). Personally, I settled on Gnome 3 for my dev box (relatively heavy on RAM, but not really noticeable on a dev monster), and LXDE where I need something more lightweight. Every now and then, I find myself thinking how impressive the GNU ecosystem is, and how people have altruistically contributed to it over the decades: gives me faith in humanity sometimes.

Pink ponies lead to pink unicorns, which immediately brings to mind the rather brilliant viral youtube video, "Gay Unicorn Planet."

Eine etwas unglckliche Zeit, ist man doch gerade jetzt am verhandeln eines besseren Tarifs fr die Chiropraxis der seit 1996 nie korrigiert wurde.Ziel der HSK wird es wohl aber sein den Tarif von 4.20 bis 4.40 nach unten zu drcken. So wird es wohl bald auch in der Chiropraktik ein Zweiklassen System geben. Ein gltiger, kantonaler Tarif fr die HSK und einer fr alle anderen Kassen die der Santesuisse angeschlossen sind.Dieses Spielchen kennen wir doch? Die HSK wird dann einen angepassten Tarif von 3.40 bis 3.60 anbieten um sich dann nach langem Kampf bei 3.70 bis 3.90 zu einigen. 
I think part of the reason my husband doesn help as much is my fault. From the beginning, I had it in my head that as a new stay at home mom, this was my new "job" and primarily my responsibility. My husbands was to provide for all of us. So I encouraged him to get sleep so he could function at work, and he has gotten used to that. I didn realize how difficult this was going to get though. My husband sleeps really heavily, while I a really light sleeper. So even though he offers to help me, I the one who wakes up when the babies do, and I then have to wake him up. By then, I already awake, so I tend to just get up and do it myself. Even when I have him get up with them, it is harder for him to settle the boys, so I end up laying there, listening to him struggle, and after an hour I just get up and take over.
I would have preferred Jake having a less easy tee up to living in the past from the diner owner and seeing him struggle a bit as the b plot rather than a lazy romance between a two dimensional side character and barely fleshed out main character.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has long been the mainstay of enlarged prostate surgery, but less invasive alternatives are now available, with the potential for equal results. With TURP, the obstructing portion of the enlarged prostate tissue is removed. Like TURP, the so called GreenLight PVP Laser Therapy aims to create a channel in the urethra through which men can urinate more freely   but the surgery is considerably less invasive. Instead of cutting tissue out, the newer technique creates the channel by vaporizing the tissue using laser energy. Thus far, almost every study has shown that when done by experienced urologists, the laser enlarged prostate surgery produces results that are equal to those with TURP, but without the severe side effects and risks. It is an outpatient procedure with minimal to no bleeding, no risk of fluid absorption, and catheterization only overnight, if at all.

I don't really play mario, but you are dash attacking too much. You probably should be trying to dash and then going for a grab and then trying for combos from throws. From dashing toward your opponent, you can also let the stick comeback to center and then do an attack, like a tilt attack. I am not sure which controller you use, but you can set the c stick to a tilt attack and it makes this type of movement easier. You might need to practice it a bit to get it down.

I feel that I'm up against a wall of idiocy, she said. don't have too many years left to fool around with their book theories, and I'm not going to let them kill me. The tragic fact is, of course, that many doctors today would sacrifice her health and, indeed, even her life. Like most fanatics, to these doctors any price the patient might pay is worth achieving their obsessive goal keeping the patient's TSH range. Some inhalants patients use to relieve their asthmatic symptoms work by stimulating beta2 adrenergic receptors in the bronchial tubes.[28] Stimulating the receptors dilates the tubes and constricts blood vessels in their lining, which dries mucous secretions. These effects of the inhalants relieve shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing respiration.[25,p.207]

For millennia, people around the globe plopped into natural hot springs to soothe their minds and bodies. Some claim the minerals in the water are a boon to one's health, while others note it's the steamy water that's so beneficial.

The arts of Greek antiquity inspired many later periods. For the first time in the Western world, art was founded on theoretical principles of proportion, composition and trying to be as close to re creating reality as possible   or even more than that. Greek antiquity even laid the foundation of research in arts history, still influencing historians in the 20th Century.

Pronouns aren really in the Japanese language, sure there are different ways to say "I" (the closest thing we can get to a pronoun in Japan) but it not really restricted to any gender, woman can and do use boku/ore even when it usually men who use it, and men can use watashi even tho it can just be women who usually use it. (btw I think iirc I saw someone saying Rin was using Boku). 
Now, I do want to be extremely clear that I am talking about ethical power dynamics and absolutely did not state that this situation "is equivalent to raping a child" or anything like that. Most universities actually have strict conduct policies about instructors having sex with their students. While it's true adults are less vulnerable than children (I'm aware 18 is adulthood, thanks!), that doesn't make anything done to them completely acceptable.

I Mormon as well, so I can answer this. There no official church position on R rated movies, but there is a cultural tradition of not watching them. One church leader in the 70s or 80s advised young men not to see R rated movies, so I think that where people get the idea. BYU (the church run university) shows R rated movies to its students, so there proof that the church doesn forbid its members from watching them. Many, if not most, of my favorite movies are rated R.

Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself.

A little known fact is they actually planned to use nuclear devices in Vietnam. My old boss was one of the guys who was trained to do this. They had these small tactical nukes (about 80lbs or so) in a backpack and they planned to air drop the Army guys in, two to a team, and detonate them at the damns and flood the country in hopes for a quick surrender. I doubt it would accomplish much besides killing a lot of civilians.

I still gotta wonder why this wasn the baseline to begin with. Virtually all of the risk is in launch, rendezvous/docking, or reentry, stretching the ISS stay should have been little trouble. Moving to a 3 member crew is a much bigger risk. Dedicated demo flights really only make sense when the difference from the full mission profile is very significant (Apollo 7 vs 8 vs 10 vs 11). And at a few hundred million per flight (and a maximum of 6 post certification missions per contractor before CC2), thats a big hit

In most poker variants, such as Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha, there are 5 shared cards, or community cards dealt. This is simply because the rules are as such. There are other variants of poker, such as 7 Card Stud (Every player first receives 2 cards face down, 1 face up. Then a player can choose to "throw cards away" and draw other cards. The ammount of cards that can be drawn is the same as the cards you threw away. So 1 card thrown away, means you can draw 1 new card. There are variants which allow up to 3 draws. In this variant there are no shared   or community   cards dealt.) (Full Answer)

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the bond an option markets were dominated by traders who had learned their craft by experience. They believed that there experience and intuition for trading were a renewable edge; this is, that they could make money just as they always had by continuing to trade as they always had. By the mid 1990s, a revolution in trading had occurred; the old school grizzled traders had been replaced by a new breed of quantitative analysts, applying mathematics to the "art" of trading and making of it a science. Similarly in poker, for decades, the highest level of pokers have been dominated by players who have learned the game by playing it, "road gamblers" who have cultivated intuition for the game and are adept at reading other players' hands from betting patterns and physical tells. Over the last five to ten years, a whole new breed has risen to prominence within the poker community. Applying the tools of computer science and mathematics to poker and sharing the information across the Internet, these players have challenged many of the assumptions that underlie traditional approaches to the game. One of the most important features of this new approach is a reliance on quantitative analysis and the application of mathematics to the game. The intent of this book is to provide an introduction to quantitative techniques as applied to poker and to a branch of mathematics that is particularly applicable to poker, game theory. There are mathematical techniques that can be applied for poker that are difficult and complex.

Yes, Valve have surrendered their place as chief innovators in the industry, in fact they just about surrendered their status as "game developers" entirely.

In the column from last March McGuirk stated that "There will be very few teams that have as much to spend in the marketplace next winter as the Atlanta Braves." Now if the offseason ended today it's hard to read that and not feel completely lied to by Terry McGuirk. Again I recognize the offseason isn't over and things can change but the narrative that the Braves would increase payroll up to this point rings incredibly hollow. As a Braves season ticket holder I can recall guys like Terry McGuirk and Derek Schiller assuring angry fans that increased revenue at Suntrust would lead to higher payrolls.

But apart from some factories and its Ferrari and Alfa Romeo brands, analysts say Fiat Auto is worth little outside of Italy, where it is one of the largest employers."The fact is that Fiat had been mismanaged for the best part of a decade," prior to its link up with GM, Maxton said."I believe that at the time of the transaction it was very distant from the minds of all the principals that this (put option) would ever be invoked," Scott Sprinzen, chief auto industry analyst at credit rating agency Standard Poor's, told Reuters."I would say it was not the best thought out transaction in business history, and I don't think the current management of General Motors sees that differently," he said.Jack Smith was GM's CEO when it signed the deal with Fiat.

ML: I didn't have expectations. Just having witnessed the financial crisis, I thought, "Well, if this can happen and not a lot changes on Wall Street then I'm not sure anything can change Wall Street." But, having said, that, I've been pleasantly surprised by how aggressive the New York attorney general has been. He's filed lawsuits against Barclays for the dark pool but also has several others in the works. And that's a big deal. To see what changed, you have to look pretty closely, but you can see IEX growing very quickly for a new exchange. And you can see several bank dark pools have collapsed or folded up shop. You've seen lots of fines and sanctions and things, but it is hard to know what it adds up to. So there's been movement and there apparently are investigations going on in the Justice Department. The SEC never said very much. So the SEC was never going to be a source of change, but the Justice Department and the FBI both apparently have stuff going on. I honestly don't know what. And these things often do take years, so it's hard to know what will emerge.
