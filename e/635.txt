I wish more people would see things in this way. Our current economic system prioritizes and rewards profiteering above all else. There is no incentive to conduct business ethically outside of what the "fringe millennial hipsters" say. Many times, ethical business practices are too expensive to entertain. Sure, you want to start a business, you want to do it correctly, you want to treat and pay your employees well. Remember, you competing with the real world, the real world that cuts costs in labor and cuts cost in ethical material resourcing and cuts cost in responsible environmental practices. Someone with a questionable conscience could do exactly what you do, but for a much lower price; so people vote with their wallets.

The wife explains that her sexual prowess is a God given power and that she uses it to control her husbands. Her first three husbands were old and submissive, and she would sexually torment them, teasing them in bed until they gave her large amounts of money before she would let them climax. She actually spends more time talking about the sex than she does telling the tale itself   which, by the way, begins with a knight raping a maiden. He sentences her to death and swears to never be cuckolded again. To avoid this scenario, he marries a virgin every day, sleeps with her at night, and executes her in the morning, because apparently nobody had a problem with that back then.

The padding and felt are taped, tacked or stapled underneath the table top. The padding is supposed to make it easier to lift the cards from the table while the plastic guards the table from spills. You can also make a portable poker table top. Just by a sheet of plywood with the following dimensions: four feet by eight feet. Staple the padding and the felt and you're ready to bet your Franklins away. The portable poker table is easy to maintain since you can keep in the basement or in the garage. Just make sure to guard it against moisture and heat as the wood may warp. When you are ready to play, just place the portable poker table top onto the dining table and it's time to play.

I did this more or less out of frustration and didn actually think anything would happen but as luck would have it the lock broke and I rode home leaving my friends bike in the backyard.

However if the opponent made it a $100 dollar bet your getting 2/1 on your money meaning you fold twice call once.

Anna: Our whole house is heated with an air source heat pump, a small unit that acts like a reverse refrigerator, taking heat out of the cold air from outside and using it to heat the inside air. The very thick walls are filled with efficient, high level insulation that makes it possible to heat the entire house from this one small source. It cuts down on the amount of dust produced by a forced air furnace and seems to help reduce certain allergies. The ceramic tile roofing is an old idea made new again. These roofs will last forever and there is practically no upkeep. We have all the usual "mod cons", low flush toilets, rainforest shower heads that are actually water misers and, oh yes, the heated bathroom floors, so nice.

In terms of emotional positioning no. She's a part of me and I can't imagine my life without her. If we lived closer and neither of us had kids I think the relationship would be different but within confines of distance and availability I think so yes. Likewise although I won't lie there's been interest in the part I don't list after Sarah. It's not a sexual relationship even if it is romantic.

My current routine consists of that face wash, the pixi retinol toner (i was previously using the glow tonic which helped clear acne/scarring but only to a certain point), the bahi cosmetics sunflower oil (which i think has saved my skin, but again. No idea what i'm talking about), the neutrogena spot on treatment (which has helped with scarring but breaks my chin out even more????), and i use the lubriderm advanced therapy moisturizer on my forehead which helps a lot and doesn't break me out, however i can't use it on the rest of my face. I only do this at night (feel free to bully me for not having a morning routine) because i know i shouldn't use toner when i'm going to be out in the sun (i think???) and sunscreen breaks me out.

The American Dream: Work hard and you succeed! It has always had a darker, more nightmarish side: if you don succeed, it because you didn work hard. The rich deserve their wealth; the rest of us are lazy. Perhaps the American Dream made sense before the 1980s, when wealth in the US was increasing for all 5 income levels, but the dream turned into dementia as Reaganomics took hold..

The script just prints the IP address found on the site to the console. I paste it below. If you familiar with Python you should be able to paste this into a file and execute it (after you pip installed BeautifulSoup and requests) to make sure that your IP address is rotating.

The book is not a story about a man seeking vengeance against all of his conspirators nor is it encouraging it.

JF Ptak Science Books Post entry in the neglected "Strange Things in the Sky" category.) The story "The Giant Atom" in Startling Stories was pretty striking to me, as it was published in December 19431 and (I thought) was illustrated with what looked like the first milliseconds of a nuclear explosion, except the reality of that event was still more than half a year away. There are a number of prescient atomic bomb stories written in the 50 years or so preceding the real one, and I thought that this one might be an odd, back door entry to the little sub genre..
