8) Excessive Spam. Posting multiple threads a day in excessive use. I am one of the generation that bf hurt the most (was 19 when it happened playing around 1/2 huplo online). Now i play 5/10 10/20 frplo live since i am still in college and dis not want to relocate after bf. I sattied into the 5k PLO 6max this year and had a longer conversation with dani stern (who ended up crushing me). We talked about the generation gap that exists now in high stakes games. Me and one of my friends were pretty much the only 21 year olds in any of the 5/10+ games in Vegas because our generation didn have the resources to build up a roll and relocate after bf. playing the 5k 6max made me realize that I still am not at the level of the 24 28 year old generation that crushed during the boom. That was a bit of a long background but I have two questions.

They make men carry their saltpetre at a groat a mile, and take their carriages in sowing time and harvest, with many other oppressions."
This can also be used against the "But it doesn matter"/"She not gonna stop no matter what I say"/"Just ignore her, everyone does" excuses.

The next thing that you want to pay special attention to when considering the purchase of old casino poker chips is whether or not the chip, or set of chips are stamped. The denomination and any type of branding that is associated with a particular poker chip or casino poker chip set is considered to be the "stamp". You will want to ensure that this stamp is not faded, not worn, and does not come off the chip easily. If it does, it may make the chip completely worthless altogether.

The biggest draw, to me, toward the Apocalypse Engine over something more in depth is the way the game is made to stay fast and loose in favor of keeping the story flowing. To paraphrase the general idea, "Time spent counting bullets and fuel is time better spent hauling ass and blasting fools." As a result, the game plays very loose with accounting, and even setting, since it all takes a back seat to the story the players are aiming to tell.

After all, Cyprus is a Eurogroup client state right now, and has wound up in this sorry place as a result.

It's also easy to imagine that Putin's Russia views its relations with the EU as something of a zero sum game. Russia has a 150 year obsession with acquiring influence, if not outright control, over warm water ports in southern Europe. Looked at that way, the loss of Cyprus from the EU to Russia would be a clear loss to the EU and a clear win for Russia.

The other reason anaerobic intervals are superior for belly fat loss is that they increase excess post exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) a huge amount. A 2006 review showed that protocols that are more anaerobic in nature produce higher EPOC values than steady state aerobic training because the trained muscle cells must rest restore physiological factors in the cells, which translates to a lot of energy expenditure.

Two days ago, I got a deep tissue massage that I suppose went a little deeper than I usually go. I'm having some new side effects that I have never experienced before and would very much like to get rid of. First, I have the muscle soreness (not unusual) but also I have extreme skin sensitivity throughout my body, even on areas that were not massaged. When my dog brushed by me, the sensation of his fur against my skin made me jump like three feet in the air. I'm struggling to fall asleep because the sensation of the blanket covers Ng me is so distractingly intense. After the massage, I felt fuzzy, almost like the end of a high. This feeling has continued for two days, accompanied by headaches. I began suffering fatigue after the massage but the feeling has not gone away. I spent the majority of yesterday trying to sleep off these side effects to no avail. It basically feels like the flu without any of the respiratory components. I don't believe I'm getting sick from unrelated virus, it's a noticeably different feeling than that.

The fire proof home was not much seen as a topic (so far as I can tell) in the early 20th century when Frank Lloyd Wright wrote about his proposal for one in the Ladies Home Journal in 1907.

That verrrrry spewy.Is it because I am in first position that a lead out is bad on the flop?? Say if im in last position and everybody checks then would a lead out be bad. Because I dont think i should be giving flush draws a free card.I understand now that the jam on the river is a huge mistake as good players wont fold their flush draws there.The guy was counting the cards on the board, im sure he had some sort of straight so that takes out all flush possibilities, with that information how would you play the river when a club comes out?Yeah he could be counting as a false tell but hes a fish and so am i apparently.I play my tournaments at all pubs across Melbourne Australia this was one of them where the buy in was $50 feild is decent.

The issue is that Sage Othima does generally have better stats than J+ main (except in bulk), outside of bulk and movement stats perhaps; even the damage scaling of Othima J+ is lower than Sage It true that his J+ has utility, and in the event that you do need it and have no better options nothing is stopping you from using him as such. But when it comes to needing to belt out the damage, Sage has better MATK, damage scaling and more charges for throwing out spells (J+ has far less uses on the offense spells).

1) Assuming your coveralls are fire retardant (tbe should be), don wash them with non FR clothes and dont use any type of fabric softner.

(Don worry about static, FR clothing have a % of anti static material in them.)

Today, with the economy a mess and staying that way and white masculinity losing even more ground than other groups, with a Black President, and changing gender dynamics all around, it makes sense that white men would need to be paid in the wages of whiteness.

The upshot is it really hard to come up with a reliable winrate for live. It you had a few thousand hours at the one stakes against a consistent player pool, you might be able to confidently nail down a number, but it still peanuts compared to what a typical online player would consider a decent sample size. Plus, your playstyle and strategy is almost certain to adapt and improve over that time, which is going to change your winrate as you go, which just muddies the water even more.

And, they know exactly what percentage of hands they're playing, because this is the type of minutiae they keep track of.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsMusic and GigsTV GuideWITH the forthcoming local government elections drawing near, one issue that candidates should address does not get any attention. That is the impact of poker machine gambling on people living in local communities. In Victoria, some local governments have developed specific policies which outline their response and vision to limiting gambling harm within their community. Also in Victoria, gambling and poker machine data is free and easily accessible to the public, however, in NSW this data is not freely accessible. It was recently reported that just 10 pubs in NSW made $117m profit in one year. That is profit, not turnover. In the Fairfield City Council local government area, ranked as the most disadvantaged area in Sydney, people there lost $8.27 billion to poker machines. That is billions, not millions.

Seriously though, your argument is nonsense. 
QJs is an extremely good hand. However, our view on how good QJs is alters based on given scenarios. When a player puts in 20% of their stack in most situations and especially at 1/2, it usually means they have a decent holding. This situation is no different. Therefore the "relative" strength of even our extremely good hands goes way down. QJs fits this description. Even KQo or AJo fits into this description. Same with 77 or JTs. While all of the hands I just listed are good hands, based on the situation, our relative strength just shrinks immensely.

Pragmatically, you still need both. The ratio of duration to effort, even assuming a very stable team, isn simple or linear. Further, the "very stable team" assumption is rarely satisfied in practice. It isn clear what the "velocity" estimation is. But this begs the question: why do you need to know duration? Is it for sprint planning? Then you don need duration, you need effort because you can derive velocity from effort and sprint work is measured in terms of velocity (points per sprint). Is it for release planning?

If the big blind raises to 1500 pre flop into a pot of 500 with the blinds at 100 then and you are sitting with pocket kings you must now call 1500 into a pot of 2000 supposing everyone else folds, having the second best hand theoretically you can justify calling 1.25 to one on your chips. but wait there is more lets have a look at your chip stack as well, if you are to call 1500 into a pot but you only have 1800 in chips, you need to consider the chances of loosing your seat, since the blinds are at 100 you would only have 2 rounds left to hit something else and that if the initial raiser doesn raise which is unlikely since they have already raised 3 times over the pot, so from there you decision based on a few number should be to go all in.
Liberals yelling about how the Trump Admin should not abuse children/babies, shaming the President for encouraging violence toward the press, colluding with a foreign enemy (along with other member of the GOP, several of whom spent the 4th of July in motherfucking Russia) is not the same as people on the right screaming about how Obama is a secret Muslim from Africa, and Hillary and the Deep State are conspiring to attack Trump, and Hillary is also running a pedophile ring out of the non existent basement of a fucking pizza restaurant.

But the bonuses at AIG represented a direct theft not from individuals, but from a sacred entity, We the People. Rationally, we all know that it much worse that hundreds of billions were extracted from debt and then when the debt went bad, AIG paid off the banks so they wouldn lose anything. We should be far angrier that these banks were so unregulated by the State that they were not stopped from creating this mess in the first place.

RemovingThe simplest way to remove nail polish is to use a cotton wool ball and wet it in nail polish remover. You can also buy a ready soaked box of removal pads. Leave the cotton wool ball resting on the nail for a while to soak in a bit before wiping firmly along the nail, cuticle to tip. This helps a lot at getting it off quicker, especially if it is being removed fairly soon.

Ever.A much better journalistic exercise would be to ask readers whether they knew there are strong connections between American evangelical Christians and the Ugandan debate over executing homosexuals.So the BBC World Services had this excellent idea for a public debate. They asked their readers whether "homosexuals should be executed." According to these serious journalist types, they felt that given the debate in Uganda over whether homosexuals should be killed, such a debate seemed like a "legitimate and responsible attempt to support a challenging discussion."The original headline on our website was, in hindsight, too stark.

The film has a snappy, witty tone that propels us into the story, with moments of satirical comedy, earthy humour and some exhilarating, inventively staged action. And the reason it works so well is due to the title character: thanks to seamless digital effects, Okja emerges as a smart, playful and brave creature whose bond with Mija is very strong indeed. This adds a powerful emotional kick, balancing the cartoonish but still remarkably textured performances from Swinton and Gyllenhaal. By contrast, An nicely underplays Mija, while Dano and his gang (including Lily Collins and The Walking Dead's Steven Yuen) add an intriguing edge of soulful compassion.

Current prevention guidelines endorse statin therapy for subjects at high global risk of incident CVD as a means to reduce fatal and nonfatal vascular event. Due consideration is needed in applying statin therapy in lower risk primary prevention populations.

Dietary folic acid deficiency decreases dentate gyrus cell proliferation [58]. Interestingly, systemic injection of the phytochemical curcumin enhances the new hippocampal cell survival by [59]. Other plant extracts, such as ginseng and the flavonoid containing gingko biloba might also improve neurogenesis [60 62].
