Rich Lowry, editor of National Review and a Politico contributor, argues, "Because a primary challenge would naturally come from the left, is unlikely to succeed, and involves alienating the GOP's grassroots, it is most likely to attract people who don't have a future in GOP national politics and lack conservative bona fides." He has this to say about Kasich: "On paper, Ohio's John Kasich is formidable, the former two term governor of a major state and House Republican budget chairman.

If this has happened now, when I less afraid of how people will judge me and when I finally realized my own safety is more important than seeming rude, I sure this would have played out differently. A lot of girls get hurt because they don want to appear rude. That been a major tactic of kidnapped and killers forever, luring women in by asking for help and making them feel bad for saying no. And I want to be kind, and I want to help people, but because of a tiny number of assholes I now have to say no for my own safety. Because even though 90% of the time they won attack me, that 10% still exists. And that sucks.

Where Peifer's work has a flat, childlike sense of the primitive, Byers' abstractions are resonant with mood, alive with depth, and vivid with the intensity of the moment.

This should not be taken as criticism of the OP. I think his overall message is a good one, especially since knowing a bit about fixing up your own car will also help you identify the mechanics who are trying to rip you off when a repair exceeds your ability or time available. Another tip would be to get yourself a basic OBDII reader and look up the codes yourself for that check engine light before asking around.

The last 15 years, discussions of religion in the public sphere have become very acrimonious and not very philosophical at all, he said. 
But this week, the prime minister looks like he has decided to play cards that he has kept close to his chest all these years. Possibly it has been prompted by the rather unbecoming name calling by Team Anna. The prime minister anger was palpable and for once he dropped his characteristic taciturnity. In addition, he would have noticed two things: firstly, the citizenry around the nation is upset with rising prices and the deteriorating economy; the fact that Mulayam Singh Yadav, the only non Congress heavyweight who showed up at the UPA 2 third anniversary dinner, decided to support the bandh speaks volumes (as does the fact that the administrations of Congress ruled states could not neutralise the bandh). Secondly, the BJP is getting its act together under Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi; sure, it has a long way to go, and it would help if Modi articulated a roadmap out of the current economic mess; but the current public spat is undoubtedly an attempt by the BJP to set its house in order by weeding out leaders who have outlived their utility (notice it is being done long in advance of the next parliamentary elections).

Sure enough, the monolithic corporation WCKD, run by Ava (Patricia Clarkson), is using these kids because they are immune to the disease that's turning people into Cranks who maraud across the landscape.

Make sure to also stock up on crafting materials for the next time you're bored. If you are often looking for something to do at home, take some time to pick out some arts and crafts supplies.

Just try out a few different crafts, such as pottery or bead jewelry, until you find one that enjoyably passes the time.

Well, who do we see as being the heavyweight fighters to provide us with entertaining fights in the future? The USA has of course the unbeaten Deontay Wilder (30 0, 30 KO who has been handled this far and matched very carefully. The pot of gold could soon be at the end of that rainbow. The big picture being about to unfold post Klitschko brothers will soon be happening. The money men in charge of Deontay are well aware the road will soon be clear, because the heavyweight boxing has always been the ultimate poker game. You hype your fighter, and I will see you and raise you more.

If you thought bladder stones were a modern affliction that popped up right around the same time as the discovery of Mountain Dew, think again: The earliest such stone on record was found in an Egyptian mummy, which is probably why they wake up so angry after their tombs have been disturbed. In the Middle Ages, cases of bladder stones reached such epidemic proportions that so called "lithotomists" traveled across Europe with specialized treatment tables designed to immobilize people suffering from the painful affliction while the pesky stone was hacked out of their grundle.

Learn from the experience of others. Many people find it much easier to learn proper technique from those that have already mastered the sport. Metal detecting is a skill and other treasure hunters are pleased and proud to share their expertise. Treasure hunters are friendly folks; listen, ask questions and closely watch someone who has experience. Check around in your local area for a metal detecting or treasure hunting club or group. You will learn much more and in less time from other members than you will going into it alone. Depending on the location or the terrain you wish to hunt, it is often easier and safer to hunt with a group rather than by yourself. If you are looking for a prospecting buddy, you will meet a lot of great people that share your interest.

What he told me literally broke apart everything I knew about poker and I had to start from scratch. It wasn an easy journey, but I feel fortunate because I have gotten to the level where I can hold my own online in most games and have become pretty decent at heads up and at the same time, I able to better understand why bad players do the things they do because I used to be one!

Yes, thank you, we had quite a decent Christmas. In the special red Christmas food parcel we had a plum pudding, Christmas cake, tin of roast pork with thick gravy, tinned milk, box of biscuits, all of which made a nice Christmas dinner. The usual German dinner was dressed up a bit. We decorated our barracks quite nicely, with different coloured packing paper from the red Christmas boxes. I had your letter with the parcel list on Christmas eve, and a day later came a card from   and yours, which was very nice. A letter from   next day and a letter from   and  .

All in all pretty good, but I wish it was my own. I wrote a few lines to The Independent the other day. Winter has just begun here, you should see us playing like kids, snowballing and sliding. Oh, say, how about sending news of the hockey league? We (the Canucks) are still interested in our home sport.

Of course, since then, President Obama has made a lot of choices that change nothing and actually make many things worse. Obama chose not to pursue the Bushies for their crimes  from torture to lying to the American people and Congress.

So, while MIL is loudly trying to get everyone to group together, I say nicely, "MIL, I can take the photo since I'm not going to be in it" and open my hand for her camera (yes camera, not a phone). She smiles (kinda wickedly) as if she "knew" she had the upper hand (narrator voice: she didn't) and holds the camera behind her back with both hands (like a kid trying to keep a toy away from another), leans out and says that I'm family and I WILL be in the picture. I responded, no I've already told you I'm not going to be in any photos.

He mentions Xanex, but that used to treat anxiety and panic disorders and seroquel which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and I believe both are banned substances unless you get an exception by the NFL by doctors recommendation (I know Xanex is). I agree with him weed should be legalized and it is probably better to be hooked on weed than painkillers. The opioid crisis is a major epidemic in this country, and there isn a clear solution to it, but one thing that needs to happen is doctors need to be more responsible in prescribing it, which has started occuring.

Ok, fair enough. What I was getting at was that commenters don know the whole story.

Nevertheless, the Dallas deal went undone. City zoning officials say Texas Card House could apply for a waiver to resubmit or wait two years before giving it another go.

Neither placental detachment nor miscarriage has ever been linked to prenatal massage in any scientific research. Most experts believe the reason why some massage therapists stay away, especially during the first trimester, and some doctors don't recommend it has to do with liability fears. Miscarriages are so common in the first 12 weeks that people who could possibly be considered legally liable   like someone who had her hands on the pregnant woman's belly before the miscarriage or someone who recommended that contact   simply (and perhaps wisely) decide to avoid any possible perception of causal effect that could lead to a lawsuit..

That the thing though. Employees aren usually able to bend the rules of return policies because if you allowed that, Mr. I Don Give A Fuck About My Job could potentially abuse his new found power. A manager is usually a manager because they have acquired the knowledge and ability to make tough business decisions and they are held to a higher standard than the employee at the register, so if they fuck up, you better believe that manager is going to get more than a firm talking to about it. I think a lot of retail businesses don tell their employees these things and I think it would honestly help them understand these situations better if they did.

Drug addict, high on opiates used an exacto knife to cut between the shaft of the penis and the inside of his cock head.

You should be able to tell pretty easily if your cat's cough is caused by a hairball, because he will eventually expel a tubelike "ball" of hair. A persistent cough could be a sign of an upper respiratory infection (yes, cats get them, too), especially if also accompanied by sneezing, a runny nose, watery eyes or a fever. A visit to the veterinarian may be in order. Persistent coughs due to feline colds or flu can sometimes be helped with medication, but it's important not to give your cat anything without consulting your veterinarian first.

Player gets dealt a big ace (AK); when the flop appears they hit none of their hoped for cards, then make the dreaded mistake of calling big bets still hoping to hit on the turn, and they miss their needed cards completely on the turn as well, but for some strange reason continue to call bets. They don't realize that only a high card hand is pretty weak without a pair, flush or straight, because any made hand beats a AK high hand. 
Also, I not sure why Black Panther is relevant here. I sure you have a long list of reasons why you think it the worst film in cinema history and plenty of evidence that all the reviewers that pretended it was good were just pretending to like it for social capital, but it was good enough to pull in a higher domestic gross than Infinity War, so I say it actually a piss poor example of whatever you trying to say.

Trauma varies by person. Trauma varies by event. Trauma varies in repetition, type, and effect. It is common for trauma to take decades of healing. It is average for it to take years. It is not unheard of for trauma to require a lifetine of healing, and some people never truly recover. Those who do not find the healing they need are martyrs that stand as a testament to the atrocious impact trauma makes, helping open the eyes of those blessed to never know such pain themselves. Every story shared brings us all closer to closure and peace. Every heart touched is another string in the tapestry of recovery, weaving a warm cloak to help ease the cold pain of enduring trauma in solitude.

Even if trapping wild predators was sustainable (it never is, at least on an industrial scale), trapping is a pretty horrific way to kill an animal.

Countless stories set in the 1950 and 60 juxtapose the conservative conformity with modern reprobates like racism, homophobia, drug use, spousal abuse and PTSD; all of which certainly existed in this time frame, and without public acceptability, but it arrogant of our cohort to assume every one of these sins was under the surface of every home as we "correct" the facade with our openness to these problems.

If you guarantee drivers that there won be speed enforcement, expect to see speeds increase dramatically.unconvinced that paying officers high salaries to stand on the side of the road intermittently with a radar gun to issue tickets to only a handful of drivers an hour will materially "teach" a city of a million to slow down.also wouldn commit to thresholds or specific criteria other than "we look at what a municipality is doing and ensure that we think it not a cash cow". To limit one very specific type of enforcement as part of a city traffic safety strategy without giving comprehensive guidelines and supports to the rest of the traffic safety strategy strikes me as a huge overreach by the province and an infringement on Albertan city ability to self govern and make the best decisions for themselves.think this is a bad news story, that sounds good and makes for great pre election soundbites.

(can only pick one piece of armor to guard it while others don help) Whereas the stomach and chest can be guarded by multiple pieces of armor and multiple lines of defense, the head typically only gets one. One conclusion from this are that pieces of armor such as the Dustcoat or Ninja Rags could gain value if they make it more likely for the player to collapse due to stomach damage in exchange for diminishing damage to the head, as changing the values so that you can take 10 hits to the head and 10 to the chest might be superior to being able to take 20 hits to the chest and 6 to the head.

I work at a methadone clinic and have seen many people taper off methadone. The whole modality has flaws, but getting off is 100% possible. I think it really common for people to hit a wall while tapering, where they trucking along and cutting 100mg off their dose 5mg at a time for a long while and then all of a sudden it like the brain picks up on what happening and goes, "NAH." I always warn people it coming and recommend they go back up to the dose they last felt normal at and hang out there for at least 1 month, and then drop 2mg and see how they feel. If all is well, keep dropping 2mg every 2 weeks, and increase the mgs you drop as you feel able to. But if you have a 36 hour half life of your medication, it bears out math wise that your dose has leveled out after 14 days and you ready to drop again.

In 978, Edward visited his brother thelred and thelred's mother lfthryth, Edward's step mother, at their home in Corfe. Whilst there, he was murdered, presumably by lfthryth, and thelred became King at the age of about ten. Edward's body was left until 980 before being given a proper burial. His murder and lack of proper action by thelred to either bury or avenge his death meant that thelred II was, from the start of his reign, an unpopular king. When Edward was finally buried in 980 at Shaftesbury, miracles were considered to have happened near to his grave, which led to the adoption of his title 'the Martyr'.

I can definitely agree with this, I would need a lot more context on what actually happening there to really feel confident in judging his actions. However, there are a couple of hints that this situation hasn reached a point where an officer should anticipate being overwhelmed like that. He walking by himself which seems to be more of a show of force than actively stopping a riot in progress. Only one man accosted him, and after firing he allowed the suspect to walk away, which suggests to me that he fired as a deterrent rather than as a means of controlling a threat during an arrest. An example of a less severe tactic here would have been to aim the weapon at him while ordering him to back away, firing only if he does not comply.

Although clay poker chips are considered a premium selection, they do have their advantages and disadvantages. Their lifespan when used in casinos is about six years. They can break down easily after extended use but when cared for properly might last longer. It takes a few months to typically break into a set of clay chips when they will round themselves out taking on a vintage look. The clay chips available for consumer purchase are exactly the same as casino chips without the built in security features. Clay poker chips are usually lightweight.

 7 points  submitted 9 days agoThe pressure that water can deliver is trivial compared to what being buried under stone can deliver. If it would happen under those circumstances, it would be happening now, and we be able to compensate for that effect.The problem with accelerating the decay rate is that you also accelerate the heat production. If atomic decay were happening at 1000x the speed it happens today, it also going to be producing 1000x the heat.And that amount of heat would cook the Earth.Cepitore  4 points  submitted 9 days agoHow much extra heat would be produced if the decay rate was going at an increased rate for roughly 6 months? Also consider that the objective of the flood was to destroy the planet, so there would be a certain level of catastrophic heat that would still fit the narrative.This is all hypothetical, so if we are assuming there is something wrong with radiometric dating data, we couldn't even be sure that pressure was the sole cause of inflated dating calculations so we can't just chalk it all up as 100% due to increased decay rate.My point is, under these hypothetical assumptions, we don't know how much of the misinterpreted data is due to inconsistent decay, and therefore it's tough to guess how much heat the process produced.The main question is still, can pressure possibly alter decay rate? If yes, how much does it take, and if no, why?We just had a treatment on /r/debateevolution that attempted to put a number on this: they took the current heat gradient due to isotopic decay heat, and rolled it backwards to produce the numbers for a 6000 year old Earth assuming we got the decay rates wrong.This isn quite the scenario you asked about, but it fairly similar: instead of a one off event, it a constant rate change, so your scenario would produce a far higher peak temperature; it would still release the same amount of energy over time, so your 6 month scenario would be several thousand times hotter than this.Anyway, 1km underground would be 10x as hot as the sun, which I suggest is probably wrong.

There are two secrets to poker. The first is an elaborate mirror system that allows you to see everyone's hands. But assuming you don't have time to set that up, you'll need to learn how to read your opponents based on strategy. This course will teach you how to read and exploit your opponents' weaknesses, as well as how to select a table and seat, and what types of strategies work universally.

The difference in distance was a whopping yard plus a few inches! Accuracy wise, there is no question, of the old adage "the longer the length, the harder the club is to hit" certainly rings true. But wait, the plot thickens. There is another reason for having a shorter driver. 
Depending on the point in the game a bad hand is one which is the underdog (has little chance of winning) or becomes unplayable on further betting rounds. The underdog case is clear, if you have cards which have a very low chance of winning then you clearly have a bad hand. For starting hands a chart can usually be consulted which tells you what hands are good and bad. 
How much interaction occured when the lich came onto the field to save the day? If the lich just appeared to kill off the Night Twists and left without saying a word, you could just play it off as a spellcaster out gathering material components he needed for his research (Night Twist Essence/Souls?). Maybe his spell has a verbal component (the dying scream of a Night Twist) and he was out doing research on what that sounds like. The fact that the players were there was coincidental and since they were clearly getting their asses handed to them by some Night Twists, which he could handle without effort, then the party clearly wasn worth his attention.

The always glamorous Mariah Carey topped the charts with four Hot 100 1 hits with "Thank God I Found You", featuring Joe 98 Degrees, in 2000, "We Belong Together" and "Don't Forget About Us" in 2005, and "Touch My Body" in 2008. She had eight hits on the year end charts. Mariah is one of the only female artists to have topped the charts with the most 1 hits during the 2000s and is the only solo artist to surpass Elvis' record for the most number of hits in America. Mariah Carey's staggering 5 octave vocal range is one of her most recognizable trademarks. Her angelic voice is stunning. Not only is she a seasoned diva who has rightfully earned her top spot as one of the greatest female pop singers of the 2000s, but she is one of the greatest vocalists of all time.

He will also address any pre existing dental problems before installing the braces on your teeth.
