Sexuality becomes something "other" people have. And those other people are not, of course, as fully human as "people like us." And so debating whether homosexuals should be executed becomes "good journalism." If the journalists at the BBC had stopped for a moment and asked "If I were queer, would I ask this question? How would it feel to be queer and know that if I lived in Uganda I could be killed for loving someone else?" then they know that killing people for the gender of the people they love is no different than killing people for the color of their skin or their religion. It not really up for debate. Ever.

They will sleep in the same room where they work to save money (as the rooms are rented by the day), and they focus on working as much as possible to maximize what they take home.

Your first statement is really a common paradigm that people fall for. Poker doesn really work that way. In theory you supposed to bet less on each street. On the flop typically you want to have 2 bluffs for every 1 value bet. 1:1 on the turn, and 2 value bets for every bluff on the river to be at equilibrium and to make your opponent indifferent to bluff catching. So hes going to fire every value bet on the flop and X number of bluffs. The turn is a brick but that doesnt mean hes going to continue to barrel with every bluff he used on the flop and in this formation I think hes lacking in bluffs in his preflop range. On the other side almost no players are going to check back value here. So to answer your question I calling on the flop because I not always facing another turn barrel. Our hand performs significantly worse vs bet flop and turn compared to bet flop check turn.

Then these boomers see Reagan, and trickle down, and since they are the beginning of their prime "money making" years (25+) they are like "yeah dude, this gravy train is never gonna stop for us, so why limit our own earning with high taxes? Why should I need to fund schools more, they were funded fine when I was there. These roads and bridges were just built, why waste more money on that? Etc." They (rightfully) saw their future incomes growing because they were the next generation who would step into power in their careers, and since their money making potential was already high, they voted en masse to protect their financial futures, by not taxing themselves.

There are two main methods: theoretical and empirical. The first of these is used when there is a relatively simple modelfor the possible outcomes of a trial. For example, if you roll afair die, laws of physics suggest that each of the six faces isequally likely to end up on the top face. The second method is used when there is no satisfactory model basedpurely on theory: if you have a loaded die, for example. It may,just about, be possibly to analyse the physical properties of themass distribution within the coin and develop an appropriate modelfor the outcome of a throw. However, it is simpler to use thesecond method. Given the chance, roll the die again and again (andagain and again and . ) and record the outcomes. The probabilityof any particular outcome is the proportion of the trials thatresult in that particular event. Thus, if a loaded die comes up 6fifty times out of 200 throws, then the probability of throwing a 6is 50/200 = 0.25. (Full Answer)

That why it actually not very surprising that British Celtic imparted only about ten loanwords into English, but also why it very surprising that there is an absolute lack of Celtic influence on Old English syntax and sound system. This is likely because the British Celtic languages were regarded as very low prestige dialects spoken by marginal people with the lowest social status between the onset of Anglo Saxon colonisation and the Norman Conquest. The Norman Conquest is significant because the introduction of a new, Norman, ruling elite upset the previous binary between British Celtic and Anglo Saxon languages; there is indeed evidence of Celtic influence on the Middle English language which was made possible by English reduction in prestige, being replaced by Norman French..

God forbid you use the wrong tax calculator and you only make $50,000 a year and come April 15th you owe the government $2,500. I don know about you and your bad illogical logic (get the joke) but telling middle class to poor people to try to guestimate their exact taxes using a third party is literally the same as telling middle class to poor people to guestimate their taxes and risk fucking themselves over.

The correct strategy to become a successful tournament player is somewhere in between these two styles. As always, you should bet when you are a favorite to win, but in close situations in a tournament it may be best to hold back unless you are getting short stacked (to have the smallest amount of chips in a tournament). 
I am not sure of when it was that the first view of the Earth from another planet appeared in print. They are certainly rare prior to 1900, so that when I saw (the following) 19th century images of extraterrestrial landscapes in American 23, 1877) with the Earth in the background I was stopped by their unexpectedness how unusual that unusualness is I don know. I remember that the very busy and gifted Camille Flammarion published views of the Earth like these in his Astronomie Populaire in 1880, though the images that follow were published several years earlier in the SA. extraterrestrial landscapes are a leap of faith based on available observations, and no doubt that the readers of the late 19th century seeing these images for the first time would have been transported by their ingenuity and depth of understanding i n representing the Earth as just another bit in the sky when it is seen from other locations. images also led to a note about a paper that Flammarion wrote for La Nature1 in 1873 on what turns out to be the similarities of the atmospheres on Mars and Earth and that led me to a somewhat earlier paper that he wrote for the Comptes Rednus that seems to have a little more punch than the later one. the short paper in the CR2 observes that the Earth is mostly covered by water, and on Mars there is more "land/continental surface than maritime/sea surface". " L dtaille de la plante montre que sa surface est bien diffrente de la surface terrestre, au point de vue du partage des terres et des mers. Chez nous, les trois quarts du globe sont couverts d sur Mars, au contraire, il y a plus de surface continentale que de surface maritime."

Using Keepass with Dropbox on our iPhone, Android phone, tablets, Linux laptops and Windows desktops, always just worked. The downside? You had to alt tab to the app and copy and paste the password; however, many sites don use recognizable password fields, so you end up doing that with LastPass anyway. The worst thing about Keepass was the file wouldn necessarily get saved back to Dropbox properly, so we end up spawning copies of it and have to import them back into the original occasionally.

If you use Hold'em Pirate like I do, the VPIP meter is invaluable in that regard. At a glance you know how your "collective table" is acting and how that is affecting the contested pots.

It kind of like building a complicated LEGO kit. The page will tell you "You will need these bricks" so you get them. Then it tells you "put this brick next to this brick and this brick next to this brick." When you run out of pages for that part, you done. Go on to the next page which begins the next part. Then it says, "Those parts that you assembled from bricks? Get those parts, and then put them together like this, and you need these bricks to hold them together." It might even say, "You will need some of part X. Go to page 10 for instructions on how to build part X. Build 5 of part X. Then come back to this page for how to put those five part Xs together to make part Y." You might get confused and try to build a part you don need. You can build that part, so you ignore it and go on to the next one. You might have already build 6 of part X instead of 5, so you have an extra, and this other part needs those bricks. So you break down that extra one and use those bricks for the part that you do need.

I think Sanders plan for free college is a complete crock of shit (particularly the funding), but I do think trade schools, community colleges, and other (credible) programs that offer 2 year degrees and stuff like that should be subsidized much more heavily than they are right now.

I don analyze infinity in technical ways, i just kinda do a magic trick and that that. probably i could write a really technical manual, but i don have the magic time powers right now, saved up, to have the time to do that. because you need to believe in computers nowadays, or they probably go haywire and you need to act out some cheesy sci fi story where you tell them to accomplish a mission by failing the mission for 7 months or something, and that just a funny way to waste a lot of time.I read John K blog, in which he shared really intense opinions about breaking reality and summoning a cartoon character that can defend cartoons, themed around time and colors, and the hulk, that he seemed to have seen in myself, and well. 
I would assume (and maybe this is where I am wrong) that they know how many outstanding chips they have and that they carry these on the book as a liability.

Also, I suspect that even when they DO read people books, the butterfly affect would prevent them from always being able to predict how to "fix" things based on their knowledge. For the same reasons that it took 40 tries for the Beast to be killed.

Inhalation: Add a few drops to a tissue or a cotton ball and inhale for a few minutes. If you don't want the scent to spread through your office or home (and it will), you can put the tissue or cotton ball in a sealed container to quickly sniff and then reseal the container until you need it again. This is a wonderful method to keep the scent concentrated. If you know what you're doing and what to use, you can use aromatherapy during situations such as labor (please make certain there are no precautions against pregnant women using the specific essential oil).

If she bought cheap laminate, paid the super cheap install prices some of the major retailers like HD or Lumber Liquidators use where it's as low as $1.99 a square foot, and she lives in a tiny ass studio then maybe she did pay $3k, otherwise she is full of shit. One thing I see as super common is people break all the costs up to make it seem cheaper in their head.

Excessive sugar intake is what leads to insulin resistance, not any particular diet as a whole, which is why keto specifically helps reduce insulin resistance (because the body is producing significantly less of it since there are no carbs being ingested)..

The basic formula for the player's expected loss combines the amount of time played, the number of hands per hour, the average bet, and the house percentage.

If the house is issuing comps at a generous rate of 40 percent of the player's expected loss, the customer's play for an hour is worth about $2.40 in comps, regardless of the actual win or loss, whether he's won $50 or lost $50..
