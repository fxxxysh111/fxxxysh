As for recency bias in this context I think it just comes down a lot to people grading shows immediately after they finish, when whatever feelings they have are still really fresh, which is the only way I can guess as to how Code Geass R2 is rated as high as it is.

A third group   and this is where the controversy comes in   would have recyclables picked up weekly, but also would have regular trash picked up once a week instead of twice a week, as happens now.Many residents fear the test program will result in the third option being implemented across the entire unincorporated county, resulting in a windfall for garbage company Republic Services because of a reduction in the total number of pick ups, from five to four during a two week period.Then, of course, there also are concerns about stinking garbage.County officials say they simply want to boost the county's dismal recycling rate, and the test runs will allow them to monitor each option for cost and effectiveness.So why haven't the test runs started?Although the county approved the program seven months ago, it depends on neighborhoods volunteering to be recycling guinea pigs.

That said, say hello again to flibanserin: the little pink pill with the Food and Drug Administration's strictest "" warning, the strongest warning used in the labeling of prescription drugs or drug products by the FDA when there is reasonable evidence of a serious hazard associated with taking the drug.

In fact, total abstinence from alcohol is required, because unlike Viagra for men, which is taken just before sex to enhance physical arousal, flibanserin (a failed antidepressant) has to be taken daily.

But the feminist, marxist, queer, and critical race academics pooh poohed the objectivists methods and their supposed objectivity as missing just how embedded their scholarship and laws were. Feminist legal scholars like Catherine MacKinnon dismantled the claim that the law is objective and argued instead that the law represents the interests of men over women in her 1989 class Toward a Feminist Theory of State. Michel Foucault, often labeled the father of postmodernism, saw the law as both repressive of every human impulse and desire and simultaneously productive (of our sense of self as say, homosexuals, or criminals, or law abiding citizens). Foucault Discipline and Punish and the History of Sexuality make clear that laws and penal systems are expressions of power, primarily the power of various forms of expert knowledge. Pierre Bourdieu gives us perhaps the most complex understanding of the relationship between our place in the social world and what we know in his theory of "habitus" structuring our "tastes". Habitus builds up over a lifetime but is shaped by our cultural, economic, social, and educational capital. Habitus is not above power, floating outside the social world, but exists BECAUSE of the amount of power we have in the social world. Habitus gives us a "taste" for the death penalty or abortion or affirmative action or lawlessness. Habitus is what a wise Latina has, but also what a supposedly objective wise old white man has.

At the same time, you have the post war labour boom.

The giant seems tallest when standing on the New Jersey palisades; when he gets to Daniel Burnham Beaux Arts Flatiron/Fuller building which had just been completed a few years before this strip he rises above it by about 1/4, making him about 400 tall. When he gets to the Statue of Liberty, which is about 305 from ground to the base of the torch, making the giant somewhat shorter than earlier, tough he seems his mightiest when sitting on the center span of the Brooklyn Bridge, this portrayal making him seem considerably taller than the earlier 400 as the height of the bridge from tower to river is about 276 I not altogether sure of how early NYC attacking giants come in in the literature, though there are plenty of other appearances of giants in the history of myth and literature (including the Cyclops, Eoclesia, Paul Bunyan, Fatna/Fanolt, Gargantua, Goliath, Orin, the Kraken, Rukh, Zeus, and so on, all of whom come before our Wall Street Wrecking giant rarebit fiend.

One of the great things about a home game is that the players are usually the same from week to week. This offers the above average player the opportunity to really benefit from knowing how his friends play and taking advantage of their habits. Keeping track of a few, simple behaviors will be profitable in the long run. Watch what your friends do when they're all in. Watch what they do when they raise, when they call, when they fold. Watch how they react on different flops. These will all prove to be profitable observations.

The planners assume, rather naively, that low income workers would be better off commuting by transit than by car, given the high cost of car ownership.

Compared to Holdem, Omaha seems a much more technical poker game than a psychological game because you can already see if there is a best hand since there is usually a straight or may be a flush on the table and often, a player on that table will have one.

It not about judging or sentencing, or taking someone full life actions into account and deciding whether they "deserve" to die. The asshole driver chose to make it necessary. It doesn matter if they were a saint every other day of their lives, on that day they chose to try to run down a police officer. "Deserve" has nothing to do with it.

Personally, I don't think Omar's statement was bigoted. But I can see how one could reasonably assume so. As Bari Weiss argued, saying that Israel has "hypnotized the world" could be an invocation of an old stereotype that has influenced many truly antisemitic conspiracy theories. I think this is uncharitable, and unfair to assume, when Omar could have just been using poetic language. Plus, harping on someone's feelings hurting tweets from 2012 is a sad game that I wish everyone would stop playing. But I won't argue that Weiss is completely unreasonable to say that. That antisemitic trope does exist, and someone trying to invoke it could make comments like Omar's. On the other hand, both examples you give, the SPLC on Maajid and Batman on Sam, actually are ridiculous, the type of things that only someone who is either completely malicious or taken in by cultish thinking could say.

The session started off in the bath where the girl washed me all over and then initiated some sex play. After the wash, my girl slid herself up and down me and rubbed her pussy on my cock from facing and reverse positions. This was unprotected so when she started doing it and I told her not to it not penetrative but it skin to skin so she moved on to a bare blowjob instead. She said I could cum more than once, but I prefer to only do it once per session so she didn push it too far with the blowjob. We got out of the bath, dried, and then moved to the bed for my massage.

Current proceedings in the trial court will take months. Then she will file her massive brief.

You also start getting Constitution modifiers for HP.AD 2e is probably the most lethal within this grouping, because the default stat generation roll is 3d6 in order.AD 1e is slightly better in this regard, because the default stat generation roll is 4d6 drop lowest.B/X D actually uses 3d6 in order, but the Constitution modifiers apply to all classes, and the DM is advised to give additional/set HP at low levels, so it probably still the least lethal in that regard.

This is the thing that I think people don understand as to why I love The Orville versus Discovery or Reboot Trek: one of the reasons I like Star Trek was because it was a scrappy underdog of a show doing the most difficult genre to make look good on a shoestring budget and impart a positive worldview.

The people who benefited from the Neoliberal university were few and at the very top.

Poker is a collection of card games that involves beating competition through a combination of cards. It also includes betting in between so the game's stakes are raised. The variations are observed in the manner by which the cards are dealt as well as the number of shared cards and the quantity of those that are hidden. 
1) Regardless if I am "better" or if my opponent is "worse", I still don know how to exploit them until I have played with them long enough to know something about them. Some players I may almost always play pocket 10 to the river with undercards. Some players I may CONSIDER folding pocket kings preflop. I don want to lose a lot of money figuring out those spots. You can exploit people in a vacuum. It requires information.

If satan is what we have(i guess that is your assertion) then I question weather sanity has even been considered in the conversation. in fact this is a display of morbidly uncorrelated gibberish, tantamount more to dissonance in of itself. and that I would attribute more to jesus than any other. That, I say not only out of personal experience, but also from the direct observation that Christianity is by and large so devout that they tend to outright ignore the reality that is right in front of their face. they pretend to care about the poor, yet rake in billions of dollars in revenue every year. Christians also want to forget morality was invented more or less by modern philosophers less than 200 years ago by thinkers like kant and mills and that they are responsible for the moral revolution that evolved to allow equality to include women, and grow to the point where legal precedence achieved. and you can say jesus would help us. why? why would the indoctrination that drug us into the dark ages and currently creates a breeding ground for delusional thinking such as that vaccinations cause autism, and that eternal life is given to those who blow themselves up(Muslims are Christians with minor differences). these are the criminals when confusion strikes. make no doubt about it. i start the list but you may get the basic jist.
They really like Pakistan despite its many problems because they are told in school of how much of a great ally Pakistan is. I hear Pakistanis hold the same sentiment. They are pretty apathetic towards India. They generally think of 3 things when it comes to India: the men like to rape, they eat with their hands and the country is poor. On the bright side Bollywood cinema has recently been looked at favorably.

System can increase use of any substance if it suits the user and the user had a reason to want more of the substance. That an across the board thing as applicable to caffeine as it is to crack. Not everyone wants more of the substance they using though, and nicotine isn especially known for ramping up/diminishing returns like crack is. My observation is that most people don increase use of nicotine just because it easy and relatively consequence free to do so. Ever hear of someone ramping up their use of nicotine lozenges/gum? Not so much. I don know about pods, but everyone I know who vapes has to mix their own nicotine into the carrier, so we can easily tweak it up or down in strength, by minute amounts if we like. Over the last few years all of my friends have either lowered their strengths or stayed the same. How often they/we vape is harder to observe but no one observably more thumb sucky than they were before.

Hence, the fact that they have the economic ability to provide so many social services, can at least be partially attributed to the fact that instead of making the same mistakes the Allies did in WWI by placing heavy reparations and keeping Germany economically depressed, we took the opposite approach and build them back up after a devastating war, so they could regain their place as a self sufficient and productive nation.

What is happening is the propagation of bad ideas in the absence of criticism. Religions do the exact same shit. So do anti vaxxers, and moon landing conspiracists, and homeopathic doctors. It is not new, and it is not limited to hate speech. Neither is hate speech a requirement for the spread of idiotic ideas. Hate speech is just a large part of the white supremacist shtick. No matter how you attempt to ban it you will not stop them from spreading their ideas. You will just keep those out of public discussion and away from criticism.

 1 point  submitted 12 hours agoI played 150+ games on Pathfinder right now. You have some sick outplay potential and you generally good because you insanely mobile. There just 2 caveats: (1) you can cancel your hook mid hook. (2) When you hook a player target, it mostly pathfinder moving towards the target, without being able to shoot whilst hooking.Even if they keep the hitbox the same, I think those two would make Pathfinder among the best characters in terms of level meta.And I noticed that is a difference in range THAT significant? For example 200 FT vs 300 FT, most people I know can clear 100 FT in under 10 seconds when running and close engagement distances, negating range and relying on who has better accuracy or is the better player overall.Short question, I heard different stances on the Rhop, some people have said it barely improves effective range, only improving accuracy while others say RHops increased their range by 50ft. Just need some clarification.Sorry no tech question, but just a discussion question that I felt would relate to teching at least a bit, and didn feel significant enough to justify a post. Thanks for understanding.

Professional players are interested in how much money they win, not the proportion of hands they win. Maximizing money can be done by many strategic routes including: playing lots of small pots; playing only a few big pots; losing only small pots but winning big pots; winning a few more big pots than you lose; and so on. Different strategies will produce different percentages of starting hands and different percentages of winning hands..

My experience working at an internet retailer was that when there was a complaint, Yamato would redeliver the package for free and refund the amount we paid them. If there were repeated complaints from one address they would have a supervisor deliver to that address once or twice. They don't generally fire people unless there is theft or the ever popular dump the package in the river and say it was delivered. As a small company, no matter how many complaints we couldn't afford to lose the Yamato contract so we would just try to keep customers happy with refunds, etc.

As a result, the only means to return to LTE in this situation is for the phone to return to RRC idle mode in 3G/UMTS/HSPA. This will typically take about 10 seconds after uplink and downlink data stops flowing from/to the phone (and this 10 second idle timer is on the network side, not the phone side, so there is nothing you can do about it.) Once in 3G/UMTS/HSPA RRC idle mode, the phone can reselect back to LTE if 3G IRAT reselection paramters set by the network result and the available LTE signal is sufficient. If the phone finds a good LTE signal, it will perform a tracking area update procedure and re establish the bearers for data flow..

My uncle got in a dui car crash, got out trying to run before the cops came and somehow fell over a rail (on the interstate he was on) and fell 47 feet. Miraculously, he survived, but even more ridiculous, is that he didn't stay down. He said he didnt feel any pain at all, just fear. So after a minute, he stood up and walked with a couple broken rips, collerbone, and half of his pelvis shattered (and whole bunch of other stuff). Granted, he only walked like 10 feet before he said he fell down and didnt know why he couldnt move. So if you mix in shock, adrenaline, and alcohol, the body can do wonders.

Skeptics question the validity of reflexology and suggest that the only benefit of having someone or something rub your feet is that it feels nice.

If you start from just a baseline level of poker knowledge, or played in the past, how much time would it take studying to get to the point of profitability and then playing to make as much money if you had just been working at McDonalds the whole time?

I think dota 2 falls into a similar issue with motorsports, where it is too long with consistent action to lend itself to commercial breaks. As an American formula 1 fan, I cannot stand how NBC treats commercials, with over 1/3rd of the race being disrupted by commercials.

Shilpa knew that and to make him have a great time, she and her husband Raj Kundra, threw a big poker night party in his honour a few days ago.

The factions and warlords push hard to consolidate their power, lines are drawn and sides are taken. Society has collapsed.
