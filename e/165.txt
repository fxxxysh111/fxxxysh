Basically the west needs to either accelerate immigration at a higher rate than now (Which has it own problems like cultural clashes and a rise in right wing activity). Or the west has to somehow stimulate birthrates (Which has other problems such as the impact on climate change and impact on female rights)
When you see the logo on the chips, there is a certain psychological benefit to their presence that cannot be overlooked. 
I think checking AA on the flop is probably not optimal vs the field, but if you do check it should definitely be the combos with the Ac so you can easily snap this off.

A bit of background: a singaporean friend and I wanted to send each other packages with local sweets.

This comment was really offensive and belittling to me. I say that I am dedicated and you as a stranger on the internet just assume that I am not born again and filled with the Holy Spirit? Am I not supposed to ask questions? Do you never ask questions about how to live your Christian life in a contemporary context? Yes, when we are filled with the holy spirit we should be able to emulate Christ but we are also human. 
A lot of comments are saying he was bullying them or being mean but I honestly think it's the complete opposite. He is years older and could probably verbally destroy them if he chose but no, he laughed with them not at them. At one point he says "not going to get sea sick looking at them waves, am I?" Which is playful and funny but still a compliment that hurt no one.. 
I hiked SOBO with a 30F synthetic bag from Gander Mtn (remember that store?). A funny thing happens to you after about a week on the trail   you get very climatized to the weather. by week three i wasnt even wearing a raincoat in the rain unless i was above treeline. I cut my pants into shorts after about 200 miles and never once missed the legs. It was strange. i was a total weather sissy before and after, but for that summer. i dunno. my point is that a  15 bag is waaaay more than you'll ever need. most days a 30 bag was more than i needed.

Now that ultracompost prices have plummeted due to the volcanic ash update, I figure it more efficient to use ultracompost on limpwurts now. Compost doesn affect yield on flower patches but it should increase survival rate by about 5% compared to supercompost (I couldn find anything confirming this for flower patches but those are the rates for other patches).

Yeah, but then, that understandable, isn it? Blind people aren hampered by communication barriers. Also, by removing communication hindrances, deaf people are also vying to be more independent. It unrealistic to expect everyone to learn ASL fluently, so the next best thing is interpreters, museum guides in sign language, subtitled news, etc etc so that deaf people can interact with society per se on the same level. 
I read a lot (on reddit, so) about the difficulty taller guys have with building mass, and I have no idea if that true.

Although notice changes are to be taken account of, while changes cannot be imposed except for safety, if everybody registered for a championship agrees or those entitled to vote on such issues all agree at say an drivers' agm, then we could introduce it for 2017.

Every player must place an ante into the center of the table, known as the pot where all of the wagered money is stored. The ante is a token bet that all players should agree on as the minimum to be dealt in. Once the ante is placed in the pot, guaranteeing that someone will win something and someone will lose something, play really begins.

"We really need to understand how our birds are reacting to these threats if we are to be equipped to help them, especially with record breaking storms causing massive mortality of birds wintering at sea," she said. The storm surges and the diminishing funds have proved to be a double whammy for the birds. 
When did Barb and Scott get married? Could they have gotten married to prevent her from testifying against him if it came to it?

Because we live in a horrible world, things like rape, murder, and rape murder can sometimes go unpunished. So the only thing that really makes us feel better is when the perpetrator is caught in the most fittingly stupid and embarrassing way possible. Take this case from Holland, where a cold case from 1999 was solved in 2012 in a manner that shouldn't have gotten past the casual suggestion phase: They just asked politely for people to submit DNA samples, hoping to randomly find the murderer."Worst case scenario, we get free blood!". 
In 1732, aromatic waters were further refined into cologne when Giovanni Maria Farina of Cologne, France, took over his uncle's business. Aqua Admirabilis, a lively blend of neroli, bergamot, lavender, and rosemary in grape alcohol, which has a distinct fruity scent, was used on the face and also treated sore gums and indigestion. 
Edit: it's not just about taxes. You aren't realizing the main way this makes companies money, YOU! By funding a charity to offset the costs of high copays for insanely expensive drugs, more people can afford the copay and Medicare picks up the remaining cost. 
After putting a lot of work into ships I was consistently able to beat them with warrior and therion. but climb the rankings much higher and you start getting to the people that actually bought the damn thing and really pumped some time and effort into it. I level 32 at 750 ranking, and the Vegas I now facing are just ridiculous. Wraith and therion just cannot match the damn things in armor, firepower, or maneuverability. It belongs at maybe 32 or 33 to buy it, and definitely should not be being faced by people in the low 20s.

People are going to try and convince you that your "motivation" is important. This is bullshit. What most people consider "motivation" is controlled by context and your emotional state. None of those things can be relied on in the long term. Your desire to improve your Russian is all the motivation that you need. Construct your habits so that you accomplish things that improve your skills. Don focus on the ultimate goal of "being fluent". If you focus your effort on doing the right kind of work and protecting your study time, you will make progress. Are you a Russian speaker or a FaceBook/Reddit addict? Your actions determine your answer to that question. What are the things a Russian speaker would do? Do those things. In just a few months your identity will become bound up in your systems/habits. And it will be harder for you to skip your learning sessions and easier to do the things that will are going to help you progress. You can worry about motivation and emotional factors once you have established study habits that work for you. 5 points  submitted 12 days ago

He probably really enjoys playing poker online so don't try to make him stop it unless he legitimately has a gambling problem and is losing enough money for it to be causing financial worry or strain on your both. If he is at the point where he is spending money on poker rather than on the bills that are due then it is time you take drastic action and he does need some professional help for his addiction. If he isn't participating in the adult content chat then just leave him be unless his gambling really is an addiction.

Well that the point. People have been able to "beat" all those things that kill us, so the average age has risen. But if someone was able to not get killed as a baby or by disease or war or an injury, they live into their 70s or 80s just like we do today before their body just got too old.

First, I want to seriously underscore the person above who said that we have reverence beaten into us from every angle, and too many in the church equate "soft" and "slow" with "reverence."

Russia is huge they can self sustain 2. Most art movements were location based at this point due to the fact that we couldn't easily communicate or work over long distances, there was less crossover.

Depending on the day she'll bring back a ton with her  think full sandwiches and sides, curry, noodles, once an entire soup sized container of salsa verde  but the fact remains that the organization over orders and has it all in single use plastic.

Is a long and complicated history to the White Paper but suffice to say that while millions of Jews were being slaughtered in Europe the restrictive White Paper remained in place, which meant that the haven for escape to Palestine was largely closed relative to the numbers of people needing to be saved, and that at the end of the war there were still 3000+ visas that hadn yet been granted.

We worked so hard on teaching my daughter to be gentle with animals and other babies. Sometimes she gets a little enthusiastic and we have to remind her to "be sweet" but generally she just models our behavior. I'm always getting comments and compliments about how gentle she is.

We've had to curb our behavior to prevent it from happening and when she does it she has to apologize and pet him. So if any parents of babies out there have this habit you may want to find an alternate way to block your dog.

The staff did not know what to do, and when I finally heard from the manager there they said they spoke with the guy and would ban him if it happened again, so someone else will have to be hurt before he is at least banned (not even arrested).

Years ago, when I and some friends decided to organize a monthly poker game, I bought a couple of short books on gambling and card playing. One book was particularly honest. It presented the odds of winning for virtually every game of chance. Naturally, the player never had an even playing field. The odds ALWAYS favored the house, often into double digit advantages. He shared his knowledge at least in part to help those committed to gambling to try and do it rationally. He flatly stated that casino games were losing propositions and the only reasonable chance of making money was in card games against other players. While the house always took a percentage, the card player was gambling against others not going against the house.

There isn't any kind of universal certification for day spas (though there are usually state licensing requirements). Just because a place calls itself a day spa doesn't mean it's going to have the specific services you're looking for.

Call ahead or stop in and go over the menu before you schedule an appointment.

But the more I thought about it, and looked at the many pictures I took of the house and grounds before we left, I realised perhaps I was kidding myself. Perhaps I just hadn't allowed myself tomissmy previous life? Even though I knew I wouldn't want to go back and knew that the idyllic pictures belie the endless grass cutting, digging and weeding the garden demanded. Or the farm smells that I never got used to, or the mud and the flies which seemed to be a constant feature of our life in the country (I swear I lived in my wellington boots for the 15 years we were in the cottage). Still, I can honestly say I do (sometimes) miss the old life.

I was raised in a denomination that said that all you had to do to get into heaven was to accept Jesus into your heart as your personal lord and savior. My denomination rejected the notion of unforgivable sins, or the need for confession. I always felt it was a horrible notion that if you happened to commit an unforgivable sin, or if you happened to sin without having last rights, then you would be doomed to hell or purgatory. I don believe in God, but if I did, what loving God would set up silly rules like that???

There are 36 possible outcomes when we roll a pair of dice. Rolling a five can be done the following ways: 3 2, 4 1, 2 3 and 1 4. That's four ways to roll a five with one roll of the dice. The odds of rolling a five are 4 in 36, or 1 in 9. . We know that the probability of something is a ratio of the number of times it can be done to the total number of things that are possible. Probabilities range from zero to one, inclusive. If something has a probability of zero, it cannot happen. Like rolling a 13. A 13 cannot be rolled with one roll of a pair of standard dice. Thus the probability of rolling a 13 is zero, as it cannot happen. If something has a probability of one, it must happen. Like the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of a pair of dice. Since any number we roll must be either odd or even, then the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of a pair of dice is one. An odd or an even number must turn up, and that is why the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of the dice is one. Lastly, we've seen that the probability of rolling a given number with one roll of the dice is the number of times that number might appear divided by the total number of possibilities that might appear.

I wonder if this is a generational shift. In the 90s/00s, it seemed like a pretty big deal that white people shouldn ever sing along with the n word in music.

After dropping hot regularly you start to gain the most important skill imo in any pvp game staying calm under pressure.People I play with that insist on dropping in the middle of nowhere are all the ones who coincidentally display these traits:get caught off guard while looting corpses for 6 eternitieszone out when we say we are moving somewhere and are looting shit we already been through 200m behind usthe last to see enemies or figure out where we are getting shot fromthe ones who don even realize we are fighting people in the same area and are still lootingdon realize which guns are good and which are bad and can only (sort of) aim with the same gun they pick up every roundmost importantly: panic when under pressure.The last one alive taking potshots 150m away when we say rush, down 2 and light up the 3rd. Probably walks straight at them while ADS when they realize they should have rushed.Complain about hot drops with a statement like "I want to win"They are this way because they haven played tons of games where they had to loot a gun and half a magazine of ammo off of their victims 4 times in a row during a multi party gun fight, they haven had to kill 6+ people all trying to kill them at the same time with guns that are bad or they don like, they haven had to race around the area dodging bullets to find a gun when there are 6+ people with guns, and they sure as fuck have never even considered channeling Neo and clutching out 2 kills on gun wielding players with their fists and no armor as being a possibility let alone determine when that is their only option. They aren used to the pressure.Anyone can sneak around and get top 10, top 3, top whatever it is for any BR.

Unfortunately, unlike Thomas Friedman helicopter visits to Afghanistan, I did not have an armed escort and a narrative spewing machine accompanying me to Lyari. I ended up in Lyari because my hosts in Karachi, brilliant young reporter Shehryar Mirza and entrepreneur (and sometimes columnist) Shakir Husain consumed substantially more nahari than I did on Burns Road that night. This meant that I, an Urdu speaking Mohajir who has not lived in Karachi since the early 1980s, was assigned the responsibility to drive the festive group home.

The wife heard I do Zumba near their house and wanted to come, so I texted letting her know I was going to x class on x day.

This was a perfect pill for the military. It has been desperately seeking to re establish its credibility, its legitimacy as a major centre of political power in Pakistan, and by extension its political bona fides. It is understandable that it would seek these things, having had its image dragged through the mud by the fag end of the Musharraf years, as he alienated and antagonised millions with his bullying of the Chief Justice, and his contempt for civilian institutions.The capitalist elite, guided by crony capitalism, is a two faced monster. It is personified by the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) on one hand, and by the opposition parties on the other. The KSE element helped sway the market downward, signaling to investors everywhere that Pakistan is such a sorry stack of cards that it will collapse into a Taliban hell, if the US taxpayers don't send that $1.5 billion   public outcry be damned. The political opposition element helped to ratchet up the temperature, in lock step with the military elite, mind you.

Then one day, I don even remember how, but I found an article in a popular magazine about a web site that was making waves. I didn even know what escorts were until this article and my mind was blown. I had thought the only type of prostitution was that with dingy streetwalkers that you see in the movies. Well, amazingly enough, there was even a Korean escort agency. I decided to take the plunge. To top it off, I was a virgin.

Still hard for me to sometimes put my finger on exactly WHY I attracted to someone, even though now, I am much more sure when it is or isn happening and who it directed at.

To some extent, it really both.

Two important points to remember: Don't overbet your bankroll, and if a machine is available at which you feel comfortable playing the maximum number of coins, do so. If you are sitting down to play with $20, you don't belong at a $1 machine that will take up to $5 at a time. It is better to play five quarters at a time than one dollar at a time. Though video poker machines pay back a high percentage of the money put into them, the payouts are volatile. It is not unusual to go five or ten or more consecutive hands with no payout. Don't play at a level at which you do not have the funds to ride out a streak.

The second one is only slightly harder, and with the above theorem in mind, it should be a piece of cake as well. P(red  7) = P(red) + P(7)   P(red  7) = 1 / 2 + 1 / 13   1 / 26 = 7 / 13. An alternative method is to count the number of cards that satisfy the constraints. We count the number of red cards, add the number of cards marked 7 and subtract the number of cards which are both: 13  2 + 4   2 = 28. Then the required probability is 28 / 52 = 7 / 13.

Ravid: I sure it will do reasonably well. The other problem is that Netflix doesn release information, which is not very good for us as researchers. My first paper 20 years ago in this industry showed that sequels and franchises were the best way to go. The Academy, on the other hand, is trying to encourage original works. That why there has been a disconnect between Oscar winning movies and popular movies. The nomination of Black Panther is a unique nomination. I think it would be really interesting to see, going back to what Josh said about the data, whether they can actually produce original films that will also be popular, rather than going with the endless franchises and sequels, which unfortunately are the most lucrative types of films.

Fast forward to December 2012. To keep a very long story short, an infection attached itself very deeply and aggressively to the hardware in my spine. Ended up in the ER, and tried to treat it with heavy doses of IV antibiotics and then a surgery after that failed to disinfect it. Horrifically, that didn work either and I spent months on a portable wound vacuum and continuous IV drip to fight it. That also didn work. The final result was undergoing spinal surgery yet again to have the metal hardware removed. The good news   my spine had fused properly and was strong enough without the metal. The bad news   over time my spinal curve has regressed significantly.

If you have a pain in the middle of your back or under your shoulder blade, it often comes from tightness in the front of the chest or shoulders pulling you forward and stressing out the back muscles. Laying with a rolled up towel or foam roller along your spine (see Right; a great anti desk posture stretch!) with your hands overhead for 5 10 minutes stretches out the tight muscles and gets rid of the pain. The vertebrae can also get stuck flexed forward, and rolling on a foam roller perpendicular to your spine can help straighten yo out (also try little half inch "sit ups" motions to gently flex the vertebrae).

In high school (NV) a male teacher once explained to me he couldn't legally tell me (a girl) I couldn't use the restroom for this reason.

Here an interesting collection of bits that I just came across in the October 18, 1883 issue of Nature, showing the speed of things. Some of the examples are quite charming, showing the velocities for an "ordinary wind", a "fresh breeze", "a race horse trotting an English mile", "flight of a falcon", "flight of one of the swiftest birds", and "a tempest"; others show the speeds of things that are quite antique, like the velocity of "a cannon ball", and "an express train travelling at 60 kph".
