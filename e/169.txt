Even with complete knowledge of how everyone wants to vote, it is very hard to co ordinate such a campaign to shift votes in such a complicated way. But it should be difficult to tactically vote to get rid of someone you don't like against the wishes of a substantial minority of people. If UKIP is the most popular party in May, it will get a large number of seats, and the electorate can stop it.

So yes, if you want to slice and dice a particular type of amendment over a limited time frame, you can give Bernie any award you want.

Oh I'm sure their ancestors wanted to clear their name because of how cannibalism was looked at by society. But they also didn't find any human bone at the site is what really makes people question the cannibalism claims. There should've been bone left as signs of cannibalism and eating and such but I don't believe they found any. But maybe they buried their bones after they eat them. Maybe the animal bones the found and studied weren't left by the donner party either. You really only have eyewitness accounts from interviews saying it occurred. One guy decided to change his stories quite some time later at age 60 but that was as about it. Everyone else basically stayed true to their original claims.

South Africa really sucks sometimes though. When I was in Matric I was walking home one day and noticed this white citi golf driving past me filled with gangsters. I thought nothing of it initially, until they drove past me for the third time. I took out my phone and called my dad to let him know what was happening and that I was a block away from home. My dad walked to the corner of the street to watch me (we had a corner house). As I got closer to my house the same golf drove by again but this time really slow, my heart sank when they opened the door, I immediately started running towards my dad, I could hear them screaming behind me, until my dad yelled at them to leave me alone while opening the gate for our dogs to come out. Luckily gangsters are scared of dogs and immediately ran back to their car and drove off. I remembered their plates and gave it to the police after I got my nerves back. Nothing came of the case though. Never saw them again luckily, I was convinced they would kidnap me (seeing as I was a female matric student with no defenses)

That love triangle stuff was clearly just a subplot in the film series and is a very reasonable plot point considering the characters are teenagers and go through some insane shit.

Conrad Black: The Liberals have stumbled their way into a disasterChristie Blatchford: Judgment against SNC Lavalin affirms the need for an independent attorney generalNP View: The Liberals arrogance on SNC Lavalin has come home to roostAs it happens there are plenty of reasons to think the DPP, Kathleen Roussel, not only had the right to make the decision she did, but was right to do so. A reading of the relevant sections of the Criminal Code suggests that SNC Lavalin was ineligible for a remediation agreement on multiple grounds: because of the severity of the crimes of which it is accused; because it has not admitted corporate responsibility; because it did not voluntarily disclose its alleged wrongdoing; because the chief argument for waving all these away, WHAT ABOUT THE JOBZ, is expressly precluded from consideration.

Barkley said on the air during the NBA playoffs he wasn't going to gamble for "the next year or two" after he was sued by a Las Vegas Strip casino in May for failing to pay $400,000 in gambling markers, or loans.

By contrast, only 6.7 percent of people without allergic disease wound up with a psychiatric diagnosis.

If your cards are just sitting out in the open, you are subject to two possible disasters. First, the dealer may scoop them up in a blink because to leave one's cards unprotected is a signal that you are folding. Second, another player's cards may happen to touch yours as they fold, disqualifying your hand and your interest in the pot. 
The community card itself cannot be used. Deal another card to every player and flip the card.

I enlisted in the Guard in 1998, and I am still in. We were called up to pull airport security a few days after 9/11, when the airports stared opening again. We had units getting called up constantly, for missions both in the US and out of it. Notice was short. In 2003 I was called up for Iraq, with just a bit over 48 hours of notice. When I was at mob site we sat in the barracks watching the start of the bombing of Baghdad on television. Obviously, my experience was very different from the active duty. At that point, the guard was very unprepared. Our vehicles and equipment were extremely outdated, in bad shape, and poorly maintained. Medical exams had not been done, many people were initially non deployable due to medical and dental issues. One guy in my unit couldnt deploy because he was literally too fat for any chemical protective suit the Army made. We had soldiers whose PT tests had been "pencil whipped" for the better part of a decade. The amount of work it took to get units ready to go to war was crazy.
On the river the most likely hands he has are slow played trips and a bunch of draws that maybe got there, maybe didn AT is unlikely to lead on the river (esp. with you being the aggressor), so what are you really winning?

Publicity move mostly.We needed World War 1 and World War 2 to learn our lessons about nationalism, revanchism, and the horrors of war. Europeans would still be militaristic, warlike nationalists otherwise.We needed the 30 Years War to realize how fucking stupid it is butchering 20% of each other over fucking religious differences.We needed to experience communism to realize it doesn work.If Brexit is rescinded, there will always be a large contingent of the population in the UK (and elsewhere) who will eventually romanticize it, how glorious freedom and independence was stolen away by treacherous Jeurocrats in Brussels.And unlike communists or ultranationalists, this group will be large, because nobody will ever be able to point to the decisive failure of Brexit   like they can to the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany   as proof of the idiocy of their ideas.Brexit will become a myth, a lodestone for what was taken away by the conniving French and Germans, by the secret Jewish conspiracy to wipe Europeans off the map by taking away control over immigration, blah blah blah blah blah.Sprinkling some democracy on a fucked up country will never fix things magically.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not report salary data specifically about litigation paralegals.

He and his colleagues at McGill have identified 10 genes associated with pain response, and researchers elsewhere have identified another 50 or so, but there are still thousands more awaiting discovery. The rest of the variation is environmental, driven by factors such as age, diet and, most importantly, prior experience with pain. In general, the more pain you experience, the more sensitive to pain you become.There are, however, some intriguing hints that the long hours of training endured by Olympic athletes produce the opposite effect.

I can't pinpoint exactly why that is, but I'm guessing it's because millennials are still much poorer than their predecessors and don't have the excess income to spend on pricy fashion when there is a comparable cheaper option. So these companies are producing less expensive pieces, keeping similar retail prices, but planning to make a profit even when their merchandise is in deep discount..

Recommendations for a card game with strategy, lots of luck (my poker playing kid stopped playing chess with any of us years ago) and for 2 to 5 teen/adult players to play in an hour or less.

Holdem is a given (not interested in other poker formats thanks). Any data format is good I'd prefer not to have to scrap the data from the source.

Concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic. Tertullian was a resident of the city of Carthage in the second century CE, when the population of the world was about 190 million   only 3 to 4% of what it is today. He notably said: "Our numbers are burdensome to the world, which can hardly support us. In very deed, pestilence, and famine, and wars, and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations, as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race." Before that, Plato, Aristotle and others broached the topic as well.
