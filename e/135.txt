Their chants of USA and "You Suck" toward the enemy team were a stark reminder that not just masculinity, but national identity too is being created and performed in the ritual of televised sport.

For me, Exmilitary and The Money Store was everything i loved about hip hop just cranked to beyond the maximum. every kick drum hit ridiculously hard, every beat was super technical and detailed, the production was grungy and broken and warped, and MC Ride was saying heinous shit with about as much conviction as any rapper i ever heard. if "OKAY MOTHERFUCKER LET DO THIS" doesn get you hyped then you have emotional issues that need addressing. what i loved the most was past the super aggro attitude and horrorcore lyrics (which were all enjoyable in themselves), the production and songwriting were genuinely engrossing, they conjured up some ridiculously mean hooks and MC Ride is a genuinely proficient, talented rapper. the synth work was interesting in the same way the best NiN tracks are, and enough can be said about Zach Hill drumming. it was three ridiculously talented men making ridiculously aggressive shit.

There are no outdoor treatment areas, but the free form outdoor pool, which winds through tropical ferns, Chinese pines, and bright ixora shrubs, is one of the best I've seen.

So if you hold the nut flush on the river, even though your equity is 100%, your EV is much more than 100% if you have more money left in your stacks because you will win whatever else your opponent puts in the pot. And if you have a very weak hand, even though your equity might be 5%, your EV might be lower than that or even 0% as whenever your opponent bets, you have to fold, and if your opponent doesn bet and lets you show down, you had the worst hand anyway.

Current democracy was hard fought.? I have to completely disagree. It was fought by university students, professors, and intellectuals. The majority of the country and elected officials didn give a damn what projectory their country was headed towards during the yushin era. Most people were satisfied that they weren starving to death like during the war. And chun doo hwan gave up power not because of uprisings or democratic movements, although they were catalytic, it was because of the worldwide attention South Korea was about to receive before the olympics along with the atrocities his administration committed during his rule. Without international attention and scrutiny, democratic elections would have never taken place for the first time in democracy was not won through a decisive victory by its own people, it had tremendous help from the international community while the majority of the country didn give a shit whether they were living in a dictatorship as long as they had food on their table. Everything you mentioned regarding the Korean fight for democracy is true. The streets of Gwangju is built on the spilled blood of freedom fighters. However, Korea democracy was hardly by its people and thus the majority of the country has no reverence for democratic ideals or standards.

Because 2 times 14 is 28, which is a little less than 33, and 3 times 14 equals 42, you know the number is closer to two than three, or your odds of winning are closer to 2 to 1 than 3 to 1. This means that for it to be correct for you to call, there must be at least 2.4 times the amount you must call in the pot. In other words, the amount you must risk, in this case $1, must have a reward of at least $2.40 when you hit your hand.

Are now on the submit page. I thought a move to 6% ABV would be great; maybe I start to see some imported UK ciders in grocery stores finally. I laughed at the prospect Utah would even consider 10% much less no limit. 6% seemed great to me. Legislators are only likely to truly moved if tax revenue drops or an angry army of bud light pitchfork wielding citizens break down their doors. Is either likely to happen?

Also note that features should be split up if they become too big. The main reason for this is that bigger estimates have a lot more uncertainty built into them, and you can mitigate that by splitting it up into sub features and estimating those.

By the end of 2017 it was being reported that the industry was worth up to a huge 14 billion each year and that figure was continuing to grow. Even a change in tax laws in 2014 that saw a number of operators close their doors to UK customers could not stunt this growth.

Yet even if the Twilighters bother to stop by the Roman baths or the Etruscan gate, the story of Edward and Bella is so compelling, so completely thrilling and emotionally satisfying, that it is what draws "everyone" this place.

Outs are cards which a hand needs to have appear (on the board in the case of holdem and other flop games) in order to win. You are correct in saying that AK has 6 outs against 22 preflop, but 22 itself does not have outs per se, because it is already ahead. In order to win, it just needs the AK to not hit any of it's outs (or to redraw on a subsequent card to the outs it does have then).

As a culture, we seem to have divested ourselves of shame   real shame, not the cheap and easy kind so easily doled out online, where anyone accused of "age shaming" or "body shaming" is expected to express, well, shame.

In 2000, one of my favorite directors made a film that he deemed his "love letter to rock music." Cameron Crowe spent his younger years as a reporter for Rolling Stone Magazine, covering some of the most notable acts of the 1970s.

Litter still has a direct affect on the ecosystem around you. It can harm local water sources and local wildlife, and materials that might have been recycled are now not.

Ah, yes. I just didn get her point that "soon" we "will see" how science will reverse his conviction. Since she has yet to file a brief, we won be seeing any decision any time soon, and we already seen any "science" she has to offer. I confident we won see any COA decision anytime in the next year, no matter how quickly the proceedings in the current remand go. And most likely not for a long time beyond a year. Current proceedings in the trial court will take months. Then she will file her massive brief. And because it will be massive, with dozens of arguments, the State will ask for and get multiple extensions of time. After which the COA will probably take at least a year making a decision.

To conclude that "CODE doesn have anything in common with the best unis in the world" from what I said is a logical fallacy. That not what I said or implied. CODE has its pros and its cons (like every other university I ever been to) and, granted, not all students would thrive at such environment, as it does require a lot of discipline and autodidacticism. I actually surprised by all the hate and downvotes it is getting here, as for me and many others this university was a game changer. People are so mad that CODE students actually enjoy and believe in their university. I mean, how dare they, haven they heard school is supposed to suck??

Besides which. What exactly is this argument supposed to promote for them? Even if you were to believe it essentially all you saying is that epic should not worry about providing a good service, instead just focus on destroying competition.

Their government is corrupt, the Sultan is lazy and unconcerned with ruling, and the military and its generals are incompetent."

Despite Murphy clearly critical relationship to cosmetic surgery, the storyline showed us over and over again that white women are guilty of what can only be called "ordinary ugliness." In other words, most of the characters on the show are aging white women (or young white women afraid of aging). When someone else shows up, someone who a man or of color, they come in for extraordinary reasons, like a tail or horrible disfigurement in an accident or a third breast. These bodies "need" to be fixed; the surgery on them is "reconstructive" rather than "cosmetic." Aging white women, however, come in over and over for the signs of ordinary ugliness  sagging breasts, wrinkles, tummies that bulge, ankles that are so sturdy as to be tankles, even vaginas that sag.

That's basically all the math you need to know. Other than that, a lot of the skill comes from playing a lot of games and some memorization   you need to know which hands you can bet, raise and call on in the first round of betting   there's a LOT more folding than most newbie players think. You'll also need to be able to get a feel for what other peoples bets are saying about their cards, because you need to know if they're drawing to a straight or if they have pocket pairs, because that makes a huge difference in terms of figuring out what cards you need to draw to win (if any), and so that impacts what your odds are.

"It was a Dhoni special and an amazing win," CSK coach Stephen Fleming said. "We have some players who are experiencing this for the first time in our side; they were absolutely gobsmacked the way he finished this game. That one shot over point towards the end of the innings was one of the top three shots I have ever seen. I've seen a few in this game itself, with AB de Villiers, and in the context of the game, taking the score down to 21 was just ice cool."
Hodgson has used substitutions around the hour mark to good effect but when Andy Carroll and Theo Walcott stripped for action on 57 minutes it was more out of desperation.

Like nearly all of popular culture, began in the hurly burly of the Victorian age. Industrialization, the creation of a large working class in opposition to a newly powerful middle class, a new mass culture of consumption, and a system of racial and national hierarchies within an empire created the perfect climate for burlesque, a working class entertainment in which all rules could be broken for comic effect and profit. Indeed, it was exactly this "slap in the face" aspect of burlesque that made it such an important part of the growing entertainment industry. Burlesque routines rewrote so called higher art forms, such as opera, as comedy and farce.

The C7 numbers are only slightly more encouraging. The first two weeks of the new TV season saw the networks average a boost of three tenths of a ratings point from live same day to the extended dance remix of C7, which translates to an additional 386,550 members of the demo who didn't break the social contract when the commercials began playing.

The sub is what it is. When I first came on as mod I was passionate about making this a welcome place for everyone and particularly more welcoming for Koreans than it had been, but over time I realized this wasn possible to enforce in an even remotely consistent fashion. I think we done better than before by stating the rules and enforcing them as objectively as we can. Again not perfectly, as long as humans are involved in moderation it can never be truly objective, but we have have a doubt or question we discuss amongst ourselves and try to come an agreement, which is what happened here. I know there are a lot of complaints about the sub, but again I think that more due to the person making the complaints mindset.

And thus you are left with the great need that nobody really cares to discuss. 
For example, you could spend 150 EUR on training sites over some number of months, play a ton of hands, get a bunch of practice with the concepts, then pay a good coach 100 EUR to review some hands, look through your database to plug leaks, etc. Then you could invest another 250 EUR plus HALF of the money you make in poker into content, coaching, whatever. That basically the offer you should compare to something like BPC. The first option will have much more flexibility overall and less risk, especially in the short term. BPC could be vastly superior if it would take a lot of time and effort to get out of the micros; it would also cap your monetary investment into poker skill assuming you could follow the program requirements. There also the community aspect of being grouped with like minded individuals.
Give students low stakes opportunities to think and discuss content   this is a "tolerance for error" approach. Students sometimes need to get it wrong, take risks, or try out different ideas to learn. This also gets many more students talking.
He absolutely right. This fucking garbage represents a shitty, super sexualized culture that borderline medieval. People having sex and doing their necessities in open spaces, excessive littering, a spike in drug circulation, piles of sexual harassment/abuse, etc. Let not even get started on the amount of public money/resources that thrown into the trash can to amuse and clean after these people. This represents Brazil, but it doesn mean it a good representation. It an extremely imbecilic part of our culture, and is just pretty much a parade of moral and civil degeneracy. This shouldn have anything to do with Bolsonaro uninformed/out of the loop tweets or anything of the sort.

On the other hand, can we get away with cutting industry out entirely when drafting regulations? I know you didn say that, but it seems the logical solution to curbing corruption. My point is that we certainly don trust the old fossils in Congress to know anything about internet/communications technology, or anything else for that matter. We need people who actually know the field to be able to advise on meaningful rules and regulations.

One of the lesser talked about reasons people advocate not re using an address is because if you have never used a private key to sign a transaction, that key is already Quantum proof. To make the protocol itself immune to quantum computing will probably require a hard fork as it would require a move to a Quantum encryption standard, which I am pretty confident will not happen until a quantum attack actually happens. But, if you use bitcoin properly, you will just jump to the Quantum fork with no loss..

I will again say I really hope we have some kind of powers we can use. I loved the ME trilogy, but there is no way I would have played it as many different times as I did if all you could essentially be was the solider class.

In general they are allowed to detain and search those suspected of shoplifting. However, there is always the risk of being sued so corporations generally don't allow employees to detain unless meeting, like you said, ridiculous standards.

But central bankers have sensitivities of their own. They internalized the lessons of the financial crisis and were determined not to repeat their mistakes. Canadian households were borrowing at rates that could only end in disaster. They had to end that mania or risk a wave of personal defaults. The policy rate remains below the neutral rate, the setting at which the Bank of Canada estimates that monetary policy is neither encouraging or discouraging borrowing. In other words, money still is on sale, so interest rates aren't the problem.

Some charities have started to reject such funding offers, but the state's public hospital system continues to support the scheme and is increasingly benefiting from it.

Gestern war wieder Live Poker angesagt. In einem lokalen Klub fand ein 50 Turnier statt. Leider waren nicht ganz so viele Spieler da, weil DK ein Lnderspiel gegen Malta hatte. 25 Spieler sind angetreten, ohne viel zu arbeiten konnte ich meinen Stack aufbauen und konnte mich immer auf AVG halten und pltzlich waren wir nur noch zu 6. Kurz darauf bekomme ich AQ und ein shortie, der die ganze Zeit am shoven war, geht wieder all in. Mit AQ bin ich mit 3x so viel auch all in gegangen, und der spieler zu meiner Linken snap called, DOH. Wie erwartet, lag ich gegen den anderen Spieler hinten 3 way all in: AQ vs AKs vs 44, der Turn bringt eine schne Dame und ich bin jetzt auf Platz 2. Wir sind jetzt noch zu viert und das Turnier zieht sich endlos in die lnge, weil 4 5 ein Spieler von River gerettet wurde. Nach 1 Stunde mit 4 Spielern geht pltzlich schnell, innerhalb von 5 Minuten fliegen 2 Spieler raus. HU bekomme ich in der ersten Hand AJs und pushe. Meine Gegnerin called mich mit 68s. Flop 642, Turn bringt einen Flush Draw fr mich und der River den Flush. Das Turnier ist Beendet und ich kann mir 500 in die Tasche stecken.

Gag. There something about watching the real Obama come out as an apologist for Bush that is really and truly nauseating. I think the nausea is about my own stupidity. I, like many progressive Americans, betrayed myself by working to help get Obama elected thinking "at least he be better than Bush." When it comes to the wars and acting like Emperor of the World, Obama is now officially worse than Bush. He may look better, talk better, and even, who knows, smell better. But Obama is not just escalating Bush wars, he now defending them.
