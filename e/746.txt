There were limited resupply options in Independence, so I can see how a box would be nice, but I had a ton of fun in Bishop. There is a fairly inexpensive hiker hostel near the center of town that has bikes you can borrow to get to the grocery store, which is conveniently where the bus drops you off/picks you up to get back to Independence. Costs a few bucks, but it is a nice place to regroup and make a food/distance plan for the next part of the Sierra, which is when the majority of the big passes occur..

But somehow, given Gaga supposed willingness to be different, I expected more from her. truth, I was somewhat gaga for Gaga up until this point. insanely brilliant lyrics like "I want your ugly, I want your disease" seemed to expose exactly the sort of perversely self destructive desires that most of us feel, but few of us admit. seemed the opposite of the "good romance" that we are coerced into wanting: dyadic monogamous coupling resulting in a white wedding and a life of being "good" and "productive" adults.

This large difference in rate of play has created another effect among online poker players. In the brick and mortar casino, the only real way to increase your earnings is to increase your limit. In the online world players have another option, play more tables. Unlike a physical casino where it would be nearly impossible to play multiple tables at once, most online poker rooms allow this. Depending on the site, a player might play from 4 to 10 tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, a player may make around $10 per 100 hands at a lower limit game. In a casino, this would earn them under $4 an hour, which minus dealer tips would probably barely break even. In an online poker room, the same player with the same win rate could play four tables at once, which at 60 hands per hour each would result in an earning of $24/hour, which is a modest salary for somebody playing online poker. Some online players even play eight or more tables at once, in an effort to increase their winnings.

Imagine sitting in your game room at your new Texas Holdem Poker Table Felt Layout with your best friends. The cards are dealt and you somehow come up with pocket Ace's.

Worse part is, on very rare occasions I can actually hear mumbling of a voice when music isn't playing like it's a radio DJ. The moment I actively try to echolocate the direction of the sound, it goes away completely. I've also suffered from very bad misophonia since I was about 13..

Loose/Aggressive   Loose/aggressive players play too many hands, usually raise, and are very difficult to bluff. These players can be dangerous because it is often difficult to guess what their hole cards are (often called putting them on a hand). Thus you are seldom certain where you stand in a hand with them. For this reason it is important to keep your starting hand requirements tight so you are often in the hand with better cards than loose/aggressive players. Most loose/aggressive players try to play the correct way, which is tight/aggressive, but they simply play too many hands. At times loose/aggressive players have long winning streaks because like tight/aggressive players, they force their opponents to make decisions and mistakes. The problem is in the long run, loose/aggressive players will be losing players because of their starting hand selection. Many good poker players   referred to as "solid"   will at times slip into loose/aggressive play by lowering their starting hand requirements. Most of these players correct this in time, but it is something to keep an eye out for, especially if they are not having a good session. The name assigned to the loose/aggressive player is "Overly Zealous." The overly zealous play many hands and always raise if they are in a hand. A true overly zealous is impossible to put on a hand since he/she can and will play anything. Thus they are very dangerous in the short run. In the long run, a solid player will end up with all of the overly zealous's money as long as the solid player can survive the short term financial swings.

The tank will take all waste from the house. The solids settle out and drift to the bottom. The liquids then flow out into the drain field (those pipes). The water returns to the earth. The solids settle out in the tank and depending on your home size the septic company will make a recomendation on how often to pump out the tank. Normally every other to every 3rd year. Really depends on how well you take care of it.

As a longtime judge of Monopoly championships, I figured out a prime reason for the game staying power.

I started Dragon Pearl by Yoon Ha Lee. I loved his Machineries of Empire series and was excited to see what was next. This is about a young girl in a futuristic empire who leaves home to search for her brother, a young recruit for the fleet who has gone a wall. Her whole family are fox spirits who have magic, choose their gender, and are mistrusted by everyone else. Although it seems like a very nice story that I'm sure I would have liked when I was young, the plotting and pacing are too middle grade for me to get into so I did not finish. I'm looking forward to Lee's next adult book whenever that is.

Both of these reasons explain why Laser Therapy is so beneficial at reducing the symptoms related to nerve injury   namely sharp pain, numbness, tingling and burning.

Tl;dr, I thought it was weird that everyone is complaining about frozen food still being frozen after being in a microwave for a short period of time. I assumed that these people must be winging whatever they cooking (ie, leftovers), because why would they complain if there were instructions to read that they didn follow.

I been sexually assaulted, and what I learned from reading the most reliable research on this issue is that most sexual violence is committed by a small group of repeat offenders.

The general strategy for any tournament play is to be tight until the field is sufficiently reduced. Later in the game you will need to open up and be a bit more aggressive. This even applies to the standard turbo tournaments. Your play style may change near the bubble, to either be extra tight to make the money, or to be aggressive to take advantage of the other now tight players. Ultra turbo tournaments are an exception as the blinds increases so fast you won't be able to play tightly at first. You'll be forced to play a lot of hands and go all in frequently. (Full Answer)

Nazis have 2 minds on issues: Their true beliefs, which they either only discuss in private, or only discuss publicly with other Nazis on Nazi platforms (Gab, 4Chan, etc.), and their false beliefs, which they discuss publicly on social media that the GP (general public) uses (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, etc.) and are only what they believe sounds good to people that are susceptible to becoming Nazis. Without this dichotomy their brand of fascism is directly exposed and thus they will have less recruits..

If your immune system just ignored those viruses and let them take their best shot at you, you'd be fine.

Instead of waging a snot based war on the virus, they let it hang out, and for the most part they're generally no worse for wear.

Wrong is wrong and we should make a fucking example out of his ass so they all think twice before taking money from an enemy state, and participating in a direct attack on the fundamentals of our sovereignty. And if Obama, or Clinton, or Bush, or Jesus Christ himself did this, they deserve the full force of the law. This country is liberty and JUSTICE for all and we fought wars over not being represented in our government (taxation without representation was what made this country) and having the sitting President/Kingwannabe pissing all over the law if a fucking disgrace, and spits in the face of our forefathers.

You and your poker buddies spend hours playing in your game room so you already know about drink and snack spills. 
But please don give up and bail on us. Some comrades in your age cohort will do just that, in a variety of ways: they kill themselves, or completely fold in on themselves in an involute and inert way, or surrender to the pull of "a normal life" and try to stave off their creeping political awareness however they can. DON DO THAT.

What, in your eyes, are we unaware of that makes us "provincial and behind the times?" I was born in this state, educated in this state and my job keeps me here. The label of "Fly Over State" and a lifetime of being assumed by some in coastal states and larger cities to be narrow minded, stupid, uneducated and uncultured because of my Wisconsin background leaves quite the sore spot and a reflexive defensiveness.
When I search for accommodation in Greek islands, my results are flooded with properties on neighbouring islands. Airbnb genius algorithm apparently determines that these places are just a short drive away. The fact that the ferry comes 2 3 times a week is apparently unimportant. Even better, I also get results from neighbouring Turkey. As if international borders, visa requirements, language, culture or being at war are irrelevant to where I might stay on my holiday.

I posted a number of bits in this blog about stupendously large and enormously small things, but it is infrequent to find the story of something made exceptionally large in a reduced world. Perhaps it is normal fare in the science fiction world, but I found the not obvious but still obvious making of a giant in microland to be, well, less than obvious. Have been countless stories told of shrinking people, or the discovery of vastly small communities living withing a larger host community, and so on, like the following:.

Would minimum wage increases actually help though? I still think they would but it's really wealth inequality that's the issue. If we drive up minimum wage more small businesses begin to fail. The hope is that those people can put more back into the economy but what happens when minimum wages catches up to the wages many college graduates are receiving? Do their wages go up as well or do people stop going to college? Do people re invest or is it now just enough to get by? The increase in the cost of goods should be marginal overall but there are many other possible negative effects. It's a confusing problem we have at the very least and something I've had to confront a lot in my state where there are very varied opinions about our wage increases coming into effect. I'm in public health/ political science / social work if that helps you understand my perspective.

Color and its use and abuse is a very personal thing especially the "abuse" part. The pamphlet below (Views of the New York World Fair, 1939, and published that year) to me is certainly one of those entries in the history of the abuse of color, not so much that the colors used in it are odd together, but the saturation of color across the board leads to something like Splendorama hyper color. I not sure why the colors are like this they remind me of a color equivalent of a laboriously and not very good translation of a tech manual. It isn as though color printing was new in the publishing industry, as books had been printed in different colors besides black for at least 300 years by this time; even full color printing had been around for 120+ years, so it isn as though they were experimenting with the color equivalent of newly available typefaces in a 1985 word program. Color photography in books is brand new at this point, the wide scale use taking place this year, but these images are not photos, so I doubt that this had much of an effect on the creativity of the designer. was very adventurously used int he early sci fi pulps and monthlies, but that stuff was already being employed for two decades by this point so their newness in regard to publishing experimentation is not an issue. so far as sci fi and color in the movies goes, that also wasn an issue because it didn exist yet, as the first color film1 in that genre didn appear until Lesley Selander awful Flight to Mars (1951).

Fear of public speaking is the most common phobia. Logically there is no good reason why we cannot simply stand up in front of a group of people and talk calmly and easily.
