(Canada) My friends grandfather used to be the chief of police in a 12 person town. In a nearby town (driving with my young friend at the time) when going from a 80km/h to a 60km/h speed zone he was coasting as most people do. A cop was parked immediately after the 60km/h sign and pulled him over because he didn slow down all the way to the new speed by the time he hit the sign. So the chief of police doesn let on who he is and politely discusses the issue with the cop, he explains that clocking people so close to the sign is entrapment as per the criminal code. The cop gets mad and says things like "Don quote the law to me", then after they both get a bit flustered the cop says he going to write a ticket. So now the police chiefs had enough, shows his badge and starts ripping into this cop for using this tactic on civilians and how his tactic was illegal.

Quite often cash game plays poorly with shallow stacks. A good example of this is using push/fold charts for stacks greater than 12 big blinds from late position and 10 big blinds from early position. With more than those depths, using a push/fold strategy is drastically inferior to a limp/push/fold strategy from the small blind and button, and a min raise/push/fold strategy from the other positions.

There one guy who works non stop, super busy and long hours. The other guy is an absolute joker. Short days, looong lunches and out the door the second one of us leaves. Hard worker comes in before me and leaves before I do (as you expect). As soon as he gone joker clearly starts getting itchy to leave but thinks he can leave before me because he never gets in even an 1.5 hours after us. I gone to the toilet on days I needed to work late and come back to find him in his jacket and packed up, clearly surprised I hadn actually left. He then sat back down all wrapped up and gone back to working as if he wasn obviously about to leave. (Maybe I should tell him that his bus stop is on the drive to my daughter daycare and I see him there every afternoon on the way to pick her up so I know he out of the office as soon as I leave.)

All of this is to say the time invested vs. reward received vs. perceived value of that reward is the primary reason this topic gets beaten to death in this sub. If I play 8 hours of comp and wind up with a net loss of Glory, I might as well have done literally nothing for 8 hours, and it feels like a giant waste of my time. Compare to something like Last Wish, where 8 hours of work might only get you 2/3 of the way through the raid, but you may get some excellent drops, and the chance to come back and finish it later. You can walk away from that feeling that it "fair" because you rewarded appropriately for the time invested. Sure, you didn get 1KV, but you also didn get nothing, and you know what to improve on in order to succeed next time.

I don't know. She seems intent to duck the first amendment issues by squarely saying that the problem is with the representations Stone and his counsel made in court. Moreover, defendants are routinely gagged in high profile cases. What if a cop or prosecutor wrote a book, "all the reasons the defendant is guilty" and sought to publish it prior to the trial? I could see some strong reasons to put a hold on the publication. The court likely can't bar its printing, but a reasonable restriction on its time and manner of publication might squeak by.

My husband and I live off of his income alone, I have injuries that prevent me from working, but I can get on medical disability without a doctor care. and I can afford a doctor, so we scrape by. My husband makes $14/hr as an automotive tech, and he busts his butt working extra hours everywhere he can to bring in enough income for us to get by. His company has excellent benefits, which just kicked in about 12 weeks ago when it was time for my first appointment! Even with our insurance we had a deductible and copays that we couldn fit into our budget, so I applied for pregnancy medicaid and we qualified. Our commercial insurance is primary, and medicaid picks up the rest that we would normally pay out of pocket. So essentially, we have NO medical expenses (Praise the Lord!) Qualifying for Medicaid automatically qualify you and baby for WIC, all you need to do is fill out the form. That will help with some basic foods during pregnancy, as well as other things like breast pumps, lactation consulting, etc. If you apply while you pregnant (before baby is born) baby is already put on and doesn need a medical reason to qualify (As oppose to adding a baby after birth). I just learned this yesterday when I was talking to our counselor! Once baby arrives, WIC covers essential foods for you, baby food for baby, etc.

She just asked me to let her come in to class about 5 minutes late and let her do her thing for a few minutes.
Bluffing is just a nice word for lying. What you're attempting to do is to either completely conceal your emotions so that no one can tell what it is you're feeling, or (and this is a lot harder) give a false impression of your feelings. The goal is to throw your opponents at the table off to either let them think they're going to win (when you have a good hand) or to make them think they're going to lose (when you have nothing worth playing).

It not like they going to suddenly take control of the dress and re fuck your wife. It gross, though, and I think her reaction is more pushing against your jealousy and ordering her to do it instead of asking (you can say all you want you not jealous but it sounds like it when you frame it the way you did instead of just "Why didn you ever clean it?" (Because it gross af)). So she being a bit bullheaded and childish.However, you also making a big deal out of a stain that you wouldn even know about had you not eavesdropped on a conversation and has obviously done nothing to you in the decades it been lurking in the closet. Yet you keep making it about "some other guy cum." And now you giving her the silent treatment. And talking about cumming on it to spite her. So obviously it not the problem that it covered in cum, but covered in cum that isn yours.If you want an easy way to move past this episode, let it die down a bit and then apologize for ordering her around, and be honest with her about how it made you feel. Ask her nicely (instead of demanding it of her) to please get it cleaned because knowing a cum stained dress is hanging in the closet is grossing you out. Or just jack off and let the chips fall where they may, man.

The main disadvantage you'll tend to find is that because there is no real money at risk, people generally play a lot looser than they would at a real money table. Some players will call every hand down to the river (last community card dealt in holdem), with hands that most good players would fold without question in a real money game.
For example, if you're thinking about renting your property to be used as a storage unit, you would need to find out if your insurance policy covers the renter's property.

Learning from a group, and teaching concepts to your study team will greatly improve your ability to understand the material.

Changing your image: By changing your image you will completely throw your opponents off guard and set them up to lose big pots in the future. If you enter a game and showdown a few loose hands and do a few stupid things your opponents will think you are being a complete donk.

Women in technology jobs are overwhelmingly outnumbered by their male counterparts. At TipTap Lab, we have about an even mix of men and women working in our departments, including our engineering and technology team. This isn't something that should be terribly surprisingly. One might imagine that, since the population of the US has a gender ratio of approximately 50/50, the gender ratio in technology jobs would be the same. Unfortunately, the welcoming working environment and equal gender ratio at TipTap Lab are the exception, rather than the rule. [You can view the recording here.]

For these reasons, we desire a ruling on the merits so that all claims to date can be considered in a single appeal.".
