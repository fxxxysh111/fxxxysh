So, one day after work, I was heading to the car with my props and cash box under my arms. Momentarily forgetting the wisdom of Batman, I made the wrong decision to take a shortcut through an alleyway when a junkie jumped out and made a move for the cash box. Unfortunately, unlike the time David Copperfield was almost robbed but used his training to convince the robber he had nothing in his pockets, my guy already had my money in his hands, leaving me no other choice but to wrestle him for it.

Don't be deceived by values. A $25,000 deck repair can easily spiral out of control into a $100,000 nightmare. Get the right consultants on the job and do it only once. A common warning alarm from a contractor is: "If you are going to seek competitive bids on this project, I am not interested because it will the make the project too expensive." What they are really saying is: "If you want me to compete on a level playing field with everyone else, I won't play."

For artists that create a genre/scene that captures a specific time, culture, vibe well that resonates to a broader audience, Its natural for them to want to protect that creation from clingers on, sell outs and outsiders that have no skin in the game but instead what to ride the wave solely for commercial success. 
I went to an event last night and one of the things the charity does is give education grants. One grant was given to a dietitian masters student studying the effect high BMI has on the prenatal/postnatal care on women. That in itself is good as being overweight shouldn mean poor healthcare or being treated shitty but in her speech it became apparent that her study is more along the "fatlogic" line that weight loss is way more complicated than CICO and she wants to create a place where there is no discussion of obesity or weight when talking to pregnant women. I guess I just don advocate doctors ignoring one component of health. She was saying things like dietitians need to believe patients when they say what they eat, etc. It was cringey for me as I feel when it comes to eating habits people are generally unreliable narrators and you cannot trust the self reporting. I also expect my doctor to politely and respectfully discuss my weight just as my doctor politely and respectfully told me I was advanced maternal age and what effects that could have on my daughter and my pregnancy. My doctor didn say your fat ass is old to be having a baby or it is a geriatric pregnancy and she didn act like I would be a bad parent having a baby at a later age. She just directly discussed with me and my husband what tests she recommends, etc. (ex. we had a meeting with a geneticist, had the fold screen, etc) for 1st time pregnant women of an older age.

Playing to impress people will only leave you with egg on your face, and most importantly NEVER play with money that you can't afford to lose. When you have been winning consistently at a certain level it's OK to progress but don't be afraid of moving back down if it doesn't work out. It's pretty obvious, as the stakes increase so will the ability of the other players, so be aware of this.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. will come into the ring to remain the sole KING of the welterweights, while Guerrero will try to overcome the odds against him in winning the undisputed WBC welterweight championship of the world. He wants to enter brilliantly the the elite circle of boxing. I think any opponent who might hope to defeat Floyd would have to be the very best in the world on his best night, on a not so brilliant Floyd. Otherwise, we will continue to witness the captivating supreme magic in the ring of one of the most brilliant boxers in history. Guerrero is a warrior and comes to the ring to destroy, but at this time he will have to find the best of the best, as Floyd has become the unquestionable most recognised and finest champion of all divisions. I would place Floyd Mayweather as the Muhammad Ali of our times.

What happened to all the people who said they come? He got over it, continued to invite the people and last year had around 60 people actually come, enjoy themselves, and thank him later. Personally, I would not have been so forgiving! But as others have said, it definitely has something to do with the impersonality of "parties" or any group invitation, people thank you for the information and wish to be supportive, but they consider it an entertainment option for the day, like movie listings say the movie is playing but you don decide to go until the last minute because nobody really cares if you, personally, attend, it happens the same with or without you.

Don call large open sizes. People on this sub post hand histories showing them calling 5x open raises with things like 89s, but this is a clearly losing play for multiple reason; you don have the required equity to call preflop, people behind you can still re raise and force you to fold your initial call, and you will be on the wrong end of "coolers" like straight over straight or flush over flush. Just fold pre and 3bet/4bet when you have strong hands.

My first publishing idea was a magazine about poker. I loved poker and thought it would be fun putting together a magazine that covered all aspects of the game, from Friday night friendly games to the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.

I quickly realized I didn't have the moral fortitude to do business in a town like Vegas and came home early looking for a new magazine idea.

Searching for and finding an ambassador (or an interior or finance minister) that will protect the interests of the president is simply an organic outcome of operating under the shadow of Pakistan's mutilated Constitution.

Many women also experience severely dry skin during pregnancy. The worst area can be the stomach, where the dryness is caused by stretching skin and changing hormones. One of the most common dry skin conditions is called pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), a rash that normally starts near the belly button but can spread over nearby areas. If you have an overall itchiness, that's normal, too; seek out a soothing calamine lotion or moisturizer for relief [source: Bouchez].

So we do worry about things like nails, barbed wire, basically sharp things that are dirty and old and therefore often have rust, and can puncture deep inside you making it difficult to properly clean out the wound.

Privacy in relationships is key to success. Why would anyone want to make their partner look bad, especially in such a public way?If you care THAT much about what your friends think of your relationship, you should not be getting married. I would never want to be with someone who would publicly denigrate me so that all my friends could see it and comment on it and I would want to me with someone that I respect enough to also refrain from doing that to them.

The narrative is fractured (which fits the story), and one of the viewpoints is in 2nd person, which always feels contrived to me. I didn start off liking this weird mix of X Men/Earth Benders/Postapocalyptic lit, but by the end it had me considering reading at least another book in the series.

The closest town is only 15 minutes away and has thousands of people and lots of history. But when I was planning a date last month, I realized that there's nothing really to do, other than shop or eat out. The bowling alley closed years ago, and there wasn't really anything to do other than that. There's no entertainment or recreation facilities around. I'd have to drive to more built up areas half an hour away for a movie theatre, or anything fun at all.

In an online poker room, the lobby contains the average pot size, how many players are checking the flop, the number of hands which are being played on an hourly basis, who are the players entering each game, and people who are on the waiting list.

The reasons, no doubt, are complicated, but surely the fact that the Canadian border is about three times longer than the Mexican one, as well as the economic stability of Canada, and the whiteness of its population have all played some role in creating a relatively porous border.

They do unfortunately. People in the veterinary field are super prone to burn out.

We have to watch owners walk out when they find out they have to pay for an exam before we will agree to euthanize their cat that we never seen before.

We get accused of trying to rob people by recommending diagnostics because why cant we just look at the pet and know what wrong?
In The Sixth Extinction, Kolbert uses a different but equally powerful technique. She begins by asking us to imagine a new species that emerged around 200,000 years ago faced with what you'd expect one to encounter: hostility, competition and above all, a necessity to adapt. Soon this species   thanks to a few unique traits such as intelligence, curiosity, language and co operative behavior   manages to reproduce and spread itself expediently across the earth's surface. Its members even find ways to cross oceans without having to evolve back into amphibians. Eventually, this resourceful biped manages to transform 70 per cent of the planet's surface, extract its subterranean energy reserves, and enslave or extinguish many of Earth's other occupants for its own benefit.

One strategy for an accelerated recovery is to use cold water therapy after your workout to help clear inflammatory biological markers such as creatine kinase and the cytokines. A recent study found that using a cold water bath at 50F for 15 minutes helps restore maximal strength after high intensity training because it helped lower inflammation and facilitate muscle repair. Ice or cold water therapy should also be used following injury to decrease the inflammatory response for faster healing and repair.

The tensions that the police ops in Lyari are instigating are dangerous and widespread. They go far beyond the problems of urban decay, or ethnic ghettoisation in Karachi. The majority of Lyari is Sindhi and Baloch. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a cheap and easy route to the hearts and minds in the Sindhi countryside is through blood in Lyari. Claiming victimhood in Lyari will resonate with Sindhis across the province. This is an exceptionally opportune thing. It isn't every day that Sindhis get a headline in discussions about Karachi.

I advise not having any plans for the day/night you first try eating. In the beginning, I made the mistake of thinking I was as high as I was going to get, then going to a local night market.

I driven there, but there was absolutely no way I could have driven home, thankfully I had others with me.

Bison is also delicious, is filling, contains a superior blend of amino acids, equaled only by other wild meats, and healthy fats. Don't be afraid of the fat. Yes, some of it is saturated, but as long as you are being smart about carb intake and managing your insulin appropriately, saturated fat is benign. 
They're more efficient compared to smoking. The base(what you see in OPs picture) shoots hot air up into the chamber where the weed is which vaporizes it and the chamber is attached to a big bag which fills up with the vapor(think balloon with a nozzle on it). After it fills up you unclip it from the chamber and clip it into the mouthpiece and you take draws from the bag until it's empty of vapor or your too high to hit it anymore cause this always puts me on my ass lol..

In September 2009, Toyota announced a new "self repairing" clear coat finish that's poised to roll out on their new Lexus models. What makes it possible is a secret proprietary ingredient. Whatever this magic ingredient is, Toyota claims that it promotes a closer molecular bond within the paint. This makes it very dense, while improving its flexibility and elasticity. These characteristics make the coat less prone to damage from the sun's UV rays and acid from things like rain and bird droppings. The flexibility also allows minor surface blemishes to be self restored. The new breakthrough requires no extra care to help protect the paint job from losing its luster and gloss.
Research has shown that "pain behavior is related to decreasing of both temperature and barometric pressure."One study noted that 76% to 83% of patients were able to predict rain by their rheumatoid symptoms. The study also showed positive pain correlations with barometric pressure in rheumatoid arthritis patients, osteoarthritic patients, and fibromyalgia patients.[Guedj D, Weinberger A.

Fatigue is a symptom of many different disorders, both psychological and physical. It is often difficult to discover its cause with modern Western diagnostic methods. Fortunately, diagnosing and treating this sort of generalized complaint is one of the strong points of traditional Chinese medicine. The first and most important step is to examine the person's lifestyle to eliminate any possible causes of fatigue, such as lack of sleep, poor diet, insufficient exercise, or overworking. Without correcting these problems, it is difficult or impossible to restore the patient's energy level. Once the proper lifestyle adjustments are made, treatment, particularly moxibustion and herbal therapy, are much more likely to be effective.
The first thing you should do before planning a home poker tournament is to check the laws in your area. Each state and in some places, even the county you live in have laws regarding gambling. In most cases the laws restrict anyone from making a profit from the tournament. This means you can't charge an extra fee for entering the tournament. Any money collected for entering the tournament should be added to the prize pool and distributed to the winners. Your local laws may differ.

Hey, no problem! There really aren guidelines out there, so you just on your own. I never worked on Big Brother casting but I seen very similar and the casting people usually make very snap decisions. They just have sooo many people to go through, if they see something they don like, they just on to the next. It seems like having a big social media presence nowadays is helpful, but not necessary, but having SOME Twitter/Instagram account seems almost like a necessity though. My biggest piece of advice is don expect to get picked. You very likely not going to as the odds are incredibly slim.

Question others' motives. Cunning people are renowned for their ability to see through others' facades. Almost everyone tells white lies on a daily basis   it's perfectly natural. A cunning person sees a person's true intentions   he does this because he's able to "read" people and also because he's done his homework (see above.) Never assume someone's telling you the truth until you have supporting evidence. However, it's also not wise to instantly assume everyone is lying. Use the information available to you to make your best guess at someone's true motivation.

The conclusion of this study seems to be saying MMR does not increase chances of Autism. Shouldn it say that getting vaccinated decreases chances of Autism? If there is a link with Rubella to Autism and the MMR vaccine is working as advertised to basically eradicate Rubella, than a decrease in Autism is what I would expect. I do fully realize Autism is a very difficult mystery to crack so I give a lot more leeway than others here. Maybe the link with Rubella and Autism is not as sound as some people think it is. Fine. However to come out with a headline like this that says "Vaccines don cause Autism" while the actual study seems to conclude that the MMR vaccine in particular simply doesn increase chances of Autism seems disingenuous. All these concerns I have without even getting into the problems that some others have noted with the methodology of the study.

After the blinds and antes (if applicable) are placed, each player is dealt two down cards (called hole cards). Then each player starting with the player to the left of the big blind has an opportunity to call (place an amount of money equal to the previous player's bet) the big blind, raise the bet (to place a bet higher than the previous player's), or fold (resign from the round of play).

If you are a communicant that means that you are confessing that you believe in the doctrines of the body you belong to. If, for example, I somehow came around to changing my mind on the ordination of women, I simply could not continue communing in the Church of Canada, let alone remain in the Anglican Communion at all, because the issue goes to the foundations of doctrine and principles and the very legitimacy of the Communion, not simply about whether or not, by accident or design, I happened to only be at services with male clergy.The whole thing is ecclesiastical nonsense.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsMusic and GigsTV GuideA MAN found with 45 grams of cannabis in his bedroom has been fined $1000 and the drugs ordered to be destroyed. Thaddeus Lee Kilby, 39, of Currawong Street failed to appear before magistrate Michael Allen in Bathurst Local Court. The matter was subsequently dealt with in his absence under Section 196. Police facts tendered to the court told how police executed a search warrant in relation to prohibited drugs at Kilby's Currawong Street home. They asked if he had any prohibited drugs he wanted to declare and he told police he had some cannabis in his bedroom. Police went to the room and found a black bag with two plastic resealable bags inside a chest of drawers. He told police the bags contained cannabis, which he owned and thought weighed about 40 grams. During the search police also located $600 in cash in a drawer and a further $1000 in a pink bag in his bedroom. Police asked him about the cash and Kilby told them he had won it playing Keno and the poker machines on September 7. Police seized the cash and told Kilby enquiries would be made about it. Police investigations revealed Kilby had obtained the money lawfully and it was returned to him in full. November 22 2013   4:00AM

A decade after the World War I, the US Secretary of State Frank B Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand put forth a pact to end the use of war as a policy. The world shall "refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force," the pact predicted, which later was incorporated into the charter of the United Nations. When Adolf Hitler set his sights on aggressive expansion in 1933, he did so with knowledge that the Oxford Union, the elite of British society, had voted in February 1933 that under "no circumstances" would they "fight for king and country".

In Swat, Dir and parts of Buner our army has suffered heavy casualties. If the US military had suffered a quarter of these casualties in the two months or so since the Swat operation started, there would have been a storm in Washington. But since it is Pakistan's 'peasant' army suffering these losses it is a different matter altogether. Washington, however, is not to blame.

Other countries will not put a proper value on us or what we do unless we first put a proper value on ourselves. If we go about with hangdog looks, our leaders ever so grateful for the smallest attention they get, we shouldn't be surprised if others treat us like a doormat.

Yes, I still in Vegas and I suppose that has me thinking about how out of place I am here. I never feel more like a New Yorker than when I enter the upside down world that is Las Vegas. My stupidly somber clothes of black and brown clash with the pastel mini skirts and stiletto heels that constitute daily attire for everyone between the ages of 10 and 75.
