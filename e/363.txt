Everyone complains about the bugs in this game, but honestly what drives me crazy is the admins. This game has the community of a console shooter, except in this game those crazy 15 year olds actually have power to do shit like this. I switched to PC gaming to get away from the god awful 15 year olds on Xbox live, and this game is worse than anything ive ever experienced in terms of poor community and maturity of said community. I started playing counter strike again due to this and I cannot begin to explain the difference in community professionalism and general sportsmanship.

The 4 main types of poker playing styles are: 1. 2. Loose passive   Players who use this style are often referred to as "calling stations" or "fish." Like the loose aggressive player, they play many hands. But unlike the loose aggressive player, the loose passive player tends to check and call more than they bet or raise. 3. Tight passive   This style basically consists of only playing very few hands, and doing very little betting or raising. 4. Tight aggressive   This is the preferred playing style used by most professional poker players. It involves being highly selective with the starting hand selection and betting and raising very aggressively. (Full Answer)

God forbid you use the wrong tax calculator and you only make $50,000 a year and come April 15th you owe the government $2,500. I don know about you and your bad illogical logic (get the joke) but telling middle class to poor people to try to guestimate their exact taxes using a third party is literally the same as telling middle class to poor people to guestimate their taxes and risk fucking themselves over.

Every bit of research on body fat loss tells us that you need to be in a calorific deficit to lose weight.

Intelligence is just one route to survival   it happens to be the one that applies to us (so we think it is special)   but if it were the only route, then all species would have it (because we all evolved and extant species exist). Species wouldn be around and exist if they hadn figured out that supplement their survival   so again be aware of the inherent you doing here, and the anthropcentric bias that represents.

For example, with 15bbs from the hijack, the GTO solution is to jam roughly 66   33, AQo   A9o, A7s, A5s, A4s, KJs, KTs, QJs, QTs, JTs, and T9s while minraising AA   77, AKs   A8s, A6s, A3s, A2s, AKo, A8o, A7o, KQs, K9s, K8s, K7s, KJo, KTo, Q9s, Q8s, QJo, QTo, J9s, and JTo. I realize my poker thinking is likely very outdated, but could you elaborate on why it not an issue that opponents will immediately know you don have a premium hand if you open jam 20bb with Ax and small pairs? Why is it unnecessary to balance 20bb shoves or 35bb+ 3bet shoves with QQ AA?. 
In purely economic terms, there are reasons to join the military, get married and send our children to parochial schools that are much less expensive because they are religious. In a country where income distribution is by far the most unequal in the industrialized world, where access to higher education involves huge amounts of debt for the majority of Americans, and where jobs that pay a livable wage are few and far between without a university degree, the military is one of the few promised paths to future financial well being.

And the novelty of it also wore off some and I could start being honest with myself about how good it actually was. Similar to how you think a new game is the absolute best when it comes out and it does everything right, then you get bored with it and suddenly notice all of the things it does completely wrong. So I guess you could say I finally outgrew the show.

Tl;dr   Boomers became conservative because it allowed them to keep hold of their wealth, and they have continued to vote in ways that continually benefits them alone, and since they were the largest voting block by far whatever they wanted to happen, happened. Younger generations have no wealth, so those policies are fucking useless for current/future generations and will fuck all of us over if we don't do everything we can to hold the rich to account. Millennials are a bigger voting block than boomers now, add Gen X to that and Boomers should be pushed aside easily..

Next is where you live. Is it possible to make a living where you currently are? (I assuming you talking about live poker) This would almost certainly require a fair amount of games running constantly, big weekends and then only 1 or 2 tables on weekdays isn going to cut it. If you have to move, how much is cost of living there? Rent, taxes, gas, commute, etc. LA for example has great cash games, my hourly there is substantially higher than anywhere in Vegas. However with LA comes much higher cost of living, very heavy traffic high gas prices to boot, high taxes, I think for just starting out the cost of living there would quickly eat you up.

One thing I rarely hear talked about is a three state solution   Gaza, Israel and the West Bank. The political climate between the territories is pretty far off, and Fatah and Hamas fought a bloody war in 2006. If a one state solution is impossible, which I think it probably is, a three state solution may actually be more pragmatic than a two state, though it fails to provide a unified Palestinian state, which may be a similar non starter.

I think that puts me in a territory of "casual viewer"? Anyways, as a casual viewer, I loved series 11. I liked Moffat and his ultra complicated lore and even his obvious fanboyism showing through the episodes, but it kind of nice to just have an episode on and enjoy it rather than having to know all the backstory. All of the episodes from series 11 were standalones and while they kind of lack depth and character development I enjoyed the stories as themselves and appreciate that I can just turn it on even when I tired from work and have fun with pregnant dude in space or witch hunting with Allan Cummings even if I couldn catch last week episode or don know the series long arc.

At the same time, sometimes having family can mean that people tell their families to "do everything" in the ICU cuz they didn necessarily have those close family bonds, and respect the wishes of their parents. I think people who allow their parents to die with dignity and they end up in hospice usually have much stronger family ties than some of the patients who family members made me break dad 92 year old chest. Maybe those people didn have the best relationship with their parents and the guilt makes them not wanna let go..
