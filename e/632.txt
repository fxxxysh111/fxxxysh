An important skill to master in Omaha/8 is reading the cards. You must be able to look at the cards and consider what the best possible hand is, the likelihood of someone having the best hand, how close your hand is to the best hand, and what chance you have to improve to the best hand. As will be discussed shortly, you must often have the best hand possible to win. Reading the cards is a skill that will become easier as you gain experience. A good way to improve your skills is to read the cards on every hand even when you have folded. This not only will improve your skills but also will help you learn what types of hands your opponents are playing. You need to determine if there is a possible low, if there is a possible flush   five cards of the same suit in order, if there is a possible straight (which will be possible on most hands)   five cards of any suit in order, and if there is a possible full house (whenever the board shows one or two pairs, players probably have a full house)   three of a kind and two of a kind.

This endowed employment with a sense of meaning and status within the community that reflected its importance. But, with increasing amounts of wealth now being generated without labour at all, work itself is seen as more incidental than essential. A generation ago, we believed wealth would increase in dramatic terms and that jobs would be available for everyone. It now clear we miscalculated and that wealth and work are no longer indivisible.

I'm 5 months out, so not terribly long term, but for me it has been the best thing I could have done for myself. My pulse rate is down, I'm not diabetic anymore, my knees have stopped hurting. I'm down 95 lbs and my classification has dropped from super morbidly obese to morbidly obese to obese and only a few BMI points away from overweight. I'm the smallest I have ever been as an adult, I can climb stairs like it's nothing and run around. I can wear heels again. I can be on my feet all day long without discomfort. My blood pressure is outstanding, despite the fact that I take medication that works like an amphetamine and can raise it, which is what makes it safe for me to take it now. My boyfriend can actually pick me up. Everything physical is easier. I hated doing chores like the laundry before because two flights of stairs and all the bending were so hard, but now it's not a problem and they are easy. Even driving is easier because I fit so much more comfortably. I can share a seat on a bus or train without people giving me that "not the fat girl" look. It's been great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has struggled wit their weight and hasn't had consistent success with other methods like me.
In purely economic terms, there are reasons to join the military, get married and send our children to parochial schools that are much less expensive because they are religious.

I am currently taking them. I have set my expectations for 325 to just get a B or B , which has taken the pressure off a bit. There is a little bit of material from discrete that gets applied in this class, and I really hate proofs, so that part kind of stinks. It's a fairly well put together class, but the lectures, while containing a decent amount of content, are painful to watch, so I've been mostly watching the MIT videos and also some on geeksforgeeks.

Cette honte d'tre gros(se) est un frein puissant  se mettre en avant pour sduire et nouer des relations sereines et quilibres.

Garak and Quark, and one of the best star trek villains in Dukat. It was all great until the last seasons when they went in hard with the "Captain Sisko is space jesus" turned up to 11, and turning Dukat into a saturday morning cartoon villain, but it is what it is.. 
German here chiming in. Did demo disks in the US just have demos or did you get full games as well? My mag of choice in Germany was called "Screenfun" and the demo disk on there only occasionally had actual demos on it   most of the time it was just full games, but usually they were indie titles. In what I would consider the golden years they also had a bunch of RPG Maker games from the super active German RPG Maker scene in there as well, those were my absolute favorites. To this day I wonder how they ever got away with selling that stuff, because those RPG Maker games were stealing assets from movies, TV and other video games left, right and center.

If he works at a FAANG, it absolutely worth seeing if it would be possible for him to get transferred to Japan (especially Google), but otherwise I think it probably misguided for the both of you for him to leave just so that he can go with you to Japan for a year. If anything, see how much of his time he could work remote and/or take off as PTO/unpaid time off and join you in Japan before looking at quitting everything to go work for Rakuten.

I have had really great results with latuda. Completely eliminated my psychosis within a week. That being said, definitely take it at bedtime. I found that it would hit me like a train, and I would be really groggy for like an hour or two before "reactivating" when I first started it. That doesn't happen so much anymore, but if I take it during the day I just feel weird in my body for a few hours. Some headaches when I first started it, but that stopped after a few weeks. Still way less sedating than every other antipsychotic I've tried.

Unlike live poker games, playing online poker will not enable you to see the real player; you only have their name and the amount of their money to know you are playing with the same player. In so doing, you won't even notice when one player leaves and another player sits down..

Whether or not a parish is liberal or not comes down to the priest running the show, but let be real, this is the Catholic church, so even the most liberal one isn going to deviate far from canon law. It more a matter of emphasis than anything. I been a member of two parishes on the East Side (St. Bernard on Atwood and St. Dennis; my eldest attends school at the latter) and they lean on the liberal side. I checked with my wife who is more plugged in to the other churches in the dioceses, and she agreed that Queen of Peace is also more liberal, than say Maria Gorretti. For example, I never been lectured to about abortion or gay marriage at either church (I know several married lesbian couples who are parishioners and/or send their children to the St. Dennis school), and I remember the St. Bernard congregation funding the CMC (Catholic Multicultural Center) after Bishop Morlino cut the funding about a decade ago. Now, I way more involved with my current parish   St. Dennis   because my child goes to school there, but I can honestly say that I love my parish community. It what keeps me coming back.
I didn repeat propaganda, I just took what Hilary Clinton actually, literally said, as you can see in my earlier reply, she said she wanted to force military action against Russia, with regards to the situation in Aleppo, making Syria a no fly zone. This isn propaganda, she literally said that, I said nothing about WWIII or what her plans are, or anything about the media, just that she stated herself that she wants to go to war with Russia. But is your position that we should allow Russia do do what it wants? Shall it continue to bomb civilians in Syria? Shall it continue to annex countries?

Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941)DirectorVictor Fleming StudioMetro Goldwyn Mayer PlotDr Jekyll believes everyone has good and evil sides. He is in love with his fiance Beatrix 'Bea' Emery. When her father Sir Charles takes her away after refusing to allow their early marriage, he plunges himself into his work. He creates a formula aiming to excise his immoral side. This instead transforms him into his evil counterpart who keeps a barmaid named Ivy as an imprisoned mistress, physically and (it is implied) sexually abusing her, until he learns that Beatrix is returning to London. Once again as Jekyll, and filled with remorse, he destroys his work and sends money to Ivy, hoping to make amends for Hyde's behaviour. When MGM made this Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde adaptation they purchased the earlier film's screenplay and destroyed all available copies of this version from the then bankrupt Paramount to prevent unfavourable comparisons. They made some minor tweaks to character names and also toned down the earlier film to make it more in line with the Hays Code, making Ivy a more respectable barmaid, although the theme of Hyde personifying Jekyll's lust and sex drive was retained.
I had already checked my temps, they were fine. CPU was at 44c and GPU was at 27c. The fans were still going and everything too. I re checked the connections on the video card and the mobo to make sure nothing was sticking out, but it was all secure.

It's time for Harry Reid to go all in or pick up his poker chips and go home because Mitt Romney just called his bluff. Reid, the Nevada Democrat, was acting more like 'Dirty Harry' than the Senate Majority Leader when he told a reporter that he'd been informed Mitt Romney had failed to pay any taxes for the past 10 years. The source of this information was alleged to be an investor from Romney's former venture capital firm, Bain Capital. But Reid has refused to give any information about his source and even admitted he was not certain this information was even true. But who needs the truth when rumors and innuendos are much more damaging? Right, Sen. . ."

A poker hand such as JTM JTM 4TM 4TM 9TM , that contains two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank (that match each other but not the first pair), plus any card not of either rank, is called two pair. If both hands have the same top pair, then the second pair of each is compared, such that 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM 4TM defeats 10TM 10TM 4TM 4TM 8TM . If both hands have the same two pairs, the kicker determines the winner, so 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM ATM beats 10TM 10TM 8TM 8TM 4TM . Two pair are described by the higher pair first, followed by the lower pair if necessary; KTM KTM 9TM 9TM 5TM is described as "Kings over nines", "Kings and nines", or simply "Kings up" if the nines are not important.   That is according to wikipedia! (Full Answer)

I agree with this. I mean, all of this comment really, but this bit in particular.

Honestly, I fucking hate seeing snow shit on my front page (rage rant incoming, literally no problems with this, it just looks cool) I fucking hate seeing all this shit on social media, like "ugh it's snowing now," or "omg! Why is it snowing now!!!" I just want to say to those people, enjoy while you can! I can't move out of my country (underage) so I'm stuck with just the fucking sun all year round. I fucking hate it, I have to grow up without any snowball fights, or snowmen, or even snow angels. I'm just sick of it all, and I just wish to see snow at least once man. Damn (I know This is gonna get downvoted, but I just had to voice my thoughts instead of bottling them again)
I am from Pennsylvania and my SO is from Michigan. We are both very familiar with how to drive in snow, but most Seattle natives hardly ever have to do it and most California transplants aren experienced with it either. It doesn matter how well we can handle the conditions if everyone else is making terrible decisions because they don know what they are doing and half the roads are ice rinks because, again, they are not salted or plowed.

I don think your wife is the emotional rock you think she is (at least as I define it).

Ah, I see what you mean. In my experience, I've known quite a few attractive Indian guys (so I never had that indianpeoplefacebook stereotype in my mind). I may be unique since the school I grew up in was very selective and we had a disproportionately large percentage of good Indian guys and the hottest girl in the grade (a blonde, interestingly) was crazy for Indian guys and cheated on her Indian boyfriend with another Indian guy so I guess I never had the thought that Indian guys were inherently ugly or something.

If you wonder if vaccines are harmful, think of this: insurance companies won pay for home births. They will oftentimes pay for birthing center births, and will definitely pay for hospital births, but they designate home births as too risky, so they won pay for you to have a midwife at home for a home birth. If something so natural is considered too risky to insurance companies despite the fact that it would cost them the least, you can bet your butt that insurance companies would stop paying for vaccines if there were considerable risk in using them.

Turmeric is harvested from the roots of the Curcuma longa plant, which is native to India [source: Curcuma Longa].

Similarly if you lose your graph will go down by $100 and your winrate will adjust.

She didn bond at all with any of the other contestants, and she definitely a bit of that awkward in her own headspace kind of person who can come across as inconsiderate of others, not in a malicious way, but in a way that shows lack of self awareness in relation to her relationships with others. I think due to her not bonding with others, the things she did that were minorly irritating became amplified since she wasn really "friends" with anyone so she did not gain that advantage of forgiveness you give someone you consider a friend ya know? But she was definitely bullied, and so even though she wasn friends with anyone, the ones that weren bullying her tended to show pity occasionally.

As an anthropologist by training, I am fairly certain that humaninvolvement in taking risks goes back to the earliest pre cursors ofHomo sapiens as we were foragers and gatherers going around theplanet; risk taking also continued when "we" took up agriculture("will the rains come" or "will the crop fail?") and settled downinto relatively permanent settlements.

The Ts on the turn might be the worst card in the deck, but the As on the river is possibly the best. It a great spot to put in a bluff with a four flush, paired board. It also less likely he has a flush as the most likely fd calling the flop is the A high. SPR just about 1:1, he needs to call at >50% frequency. He also has a lot of combo draws here I guess like J9ss,Q9ss,79ss but he can have the pair plus FD comobo fd form the flop of Tx (T9ss etc). I don hate a shove on the river   that line almost looks like you were waiting for him to get a hand and going for value, or even just spiking a four flush with the Ks. I probably would have pulled the trigger there.

Not Wearing Yesterday u/mrbitterpants mad a post about the Nike shoes for a Japanese marathon only release. This lead me down a rabbit hole. At first I thought big deal on those shoes. Then I found the Mizuno Wave Rider 21 Osaka running shoes. I must have these. I spent an hour searching for the shoe, found some over seas, but none in my size. I went so far as to chat with Mizuno who informed me it is only for sale in China right now, and there would be no way to get them directly. I would need to order them, then have the Chinese store ship them to a transportation company like UPS/FEDEX to have them shipped to me. Yeah, that a little hard to do when I do not speak a Chinese language. I may miss out on the best looking shoes I have ever seen.

But what to do? Have the state censor it all? Mandate cellulite, wrinkles and stray hairs? Probably not. How about the other plan of the Liberal Dems to create Media Literacy classes? It a start. I hate to think anyone thought of these images as real people any more than we think Barbie represents a realistic version of a female body. Perhaps we could even take a lesson from Christian Orthodoxy for our postmodern, secular cultures and apply iconography to contemporary media. Within Christian Orthodoxy, images in icons are purposefully made skinnier and elongated to give them a more spiritual and less fleshy quality. The same is true with icons of our consumer culture. We want bodies, especially female bodies, that are elongated and very nearly inhuman. We long to escape emodiment for the purely pleasurable realm of heavenly consumermism: always looking perfect in the designer clothes we wear, always looking skinny even in bikinis, always looking young and desirable. It is a fantasy, a desire, an unreal representation of real bodies. In the same way that Orthodox Christians look at an icon of Jesus and know it has been altered, we ought to be able to look at an ad or a movie star and see that what is represented can only exist in the spiritual plane. Here in our fleshy real lives, bodies don look anything like the ones we see in the iconography of film and fashion.

The fact that it's a long standing religion doesn't legitimize it in any form, IMO.Everything is relative of course.
