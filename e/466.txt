From what i read, the cards have rfid chips in them so they can be broadcast onto the screen. Theoretically, someone somewhere could know the composition of the entire shoe. If they know that the next card up is an ace, they could tell the dealer to hold that card and deal the next and "save" it for the opportune time to bust somebody or at least make it most unfavorable for the player.

Notice the wording of this one. We're not asking, "Are you behind on the payments?" That would be sort of like rubbing their faces in it. This approach is a lot easier for people to be comfortable with telling you. Of course, it also goes along the same lines as asking how much is owed and should be treated the same way.

Does any of that make sense?We always used tools to kill animals. A significant part of our rise to apex predator was due to our ability to create tools (after the discovery of fire and being able to cook meat giving us bigger brains).

Based on an earlier and more conservative Halstatt style (probably innovated by earlier Celtic speakers), La Tene was significantly by Scythian, Etruscan and Greek art in regards to its incorporation of lifelike portrayals of animals exaggerated lines, detailed figural forms floral motifs and floral vegetal motifs respectively.

Massage is nothing more than a way of fooling our muscles into believing that they are working out. The forced movement of muscles causes the brain to release serotonin and endorphins to cover the pain of muscle building. However, there is no pain so we get the 'runner's high' for free. Also, because the muscles are not actually working, they do not secrete lactic acid; lactic acid is a byproduct when one does vigorous exercise. It is not the lactic acid that makes the muscles bulk up but the exercise that one does. Therefore, our muscles actually become more flexible after a massage. Nonetheless, the most important part of a massage is the relaxation factor.

Body stops burning fat. This won be a concern as long as you have a deficit.

I think Kovalev would take the fight with Froch in a second unless he asked something unreasonable like asking him to melt down in weight to weaken him so he can get an advantage.

Long Answer: "Colorado follows the legal doctrine of "employment at will", which provides that employers and employees have an at will relationship and either of them may terminate at any time without advance notice or cause unless the employee is hired for a definite period of time or there is an agreement limiting the reasons for discharge. Many of these exceptions interact with employment law and the action of marijuana drug testing by an employer. I will list a few, but again, this topic could fill a book..

McNeer's class is oversubscribed. So Rogers, ever mindful of the connection between gambling and financial markets, plays a poker game with the professor who, despite having a winning hand, graciously accepts him in his class. One of McNeer's most challenging assignments is having the students analyze a proposed and well publicized merger between West Pecos Pipeline and Gulf Oil. It is clear why the pipeline's shareholders, who stand to bag a handsome premium, want the buyout. What is less obvious is what the takeover would mean for Gulf Oil.

The term cis was introduced to replace the usage of "normal" or "regular" in these situations to be more inclusive of trans people.

I don know the context of your relationship with this guy but if you consider him to be a friend, it kinda sounds like you betrayed him. I get that cheating isn good and it rubs you the wrong way but its his relationship and his problem, not yours. From what I can tell from the post, you didn know the girlfriend well, even if you did hit it off. Best you can do for someone as a friend is tell them what they doing wrong and hope they listen. If they continue to act like assholes, leave them be. Throwing him to the curb and telling his girlfriend behind his back no less was pretty underhanded and honestly a little uncalled for. Please try to put yourself in the gf's shoes. If my SO was cheating on me, I'd be very grateful that someone told me; I don't know you, but you'd probably(?) feel the same, as I find that most people generally do feel grateful in that situation. It's not "underhanded"; OP prodded him to tell her over and over again. That's more than enough fair warning. OP's "friend" is clearly a piece of shit.

I always boarded at the very front (or back? geez i don even remember at this point) of the train and at most 3 or 4 people could board each time the train came, which is about how many people would line up between trains anyway so i pretty much always boarded right away.

Captain Marvel, coming only a year after the fantastic Black Panther, is a disappointment. The acting and special effects are solid but the writing, by co directors Anna Boden Ryan Fleck (elevated from the indie productions where they made their mark) with an assist from Geneva Robertson Dworet, is lazy. This plays like the kind of generic comic book movie that was in vogue 15 years ago. It's high on stale, low tension action, giving us lots of obligatory fights and chases while never providing the "stakes" necessary to make the characters and their story compelling. It's the action movie equivalent of "busy work." Unlike Wonder Woman (the most obvious point of comparison), which offered a rich, well thought out backstory and an interesting mythology, Captain Marvel relies on confusing exposition and a scattershot method of universe building that's not adequate to the task at hand.

Nothing in particular happened besides that, but it has been over a year and I still remember the sense of comfort vividly.

So while we drinking our free water to celebrate the creation of Wal Mart jobs at a high cost to taxpayers, the employees, local business, and the environment, maybe we should also consider resisting?

Stopping Wal Mart from creating these "jobs" that in fact are a form of exploitation of workers and taxpayers would be worth breaking out the champagne for.

I don think so, I think the majority of people just really haven considered the topic that much, and default to the opinion that existing is better than not existing. Especially when you consider that people are likely to overestimate the quality of life of a farm animal, to protect their self image as a good person.

However, Phil rarely treads the easy path, and has been involved in numerous situations which caused controversy. He is a keen golfer, and when he plays golf, there is usually serious money on the line. He lost money   a LOT of money   playing golf against two English Poker pros, Ram Vaswani and Mark "Mr Cool" Goodwin. So he took a 6 month break, and then invited Ram and Mark to come play some more money golf, on the same terms.

From there you add the extension collar and finishing items (top cinch cord, top strap, etc).

Exactly! Someone local to me posted on Facebook whining about a dishonest Car Dealer who refused to give back his deposit and sold said vehicle to another purchaser. At 1st I believed him and said "Take them to Small Claims Court." Then I saw other evidence, another user posted a snapshot of texts from the Car Dealer stating the guy did NOT follow through with producing pay stubs proving his income to secure financing so they sold the vehicle (after holding it for an unspecified amount of time) and refunded him 1/2 the deposit. The original poster refused to answer 2 questions about how long the Dealer did hold the car waiting for him to provide proof of income.

If atomic decay were happening at 1000x the speed it happens today, it also going to be producing 1000x the heat.And that amount of heat would cook the Earth.Cepitore  4 points  submitted 9 days agoHow much extra heat would be produced if the decay rate was going at an increased rate for roughly 6 months? Also consider that the objective of the flood was to destroy the planet, so there would be a certain level of catastrophic heat that would still fit the narrative.This is all hypothetical, so if we are assuming there is something wrong with radiometric dating data, we couldn't even be sure that pressure was the sole cause of inflated dating calculations so we can't just chalk it all up as 100% due to increased decay rate.My point is, under these hypothetical assumptions, we don't know how much of the misinterpreted data is due to inconsistent decay, and therefore it's tough to guess how much heat the process produced.The main question is still, can pressure possibly alter decay rate? If yes, how much does it take, and if no, why?We just had a treatment on /r/debateevolution that attempted to put a number on this: they took the current heat gradient due to isotopic decay heat, and rolled it backwards to produce the numbers for a 6000 year old Earth assuming we got the decay rates wrong.This isn quite the scenario you asked about, but it fairly similar: instead of a one off event, it a constant rate change, so your scenario would produce a far higher peak temperature; it would still release the same amount of energy over time, so your 6 month scenario would be several thousand times hotter than this.Anyway, 1km underground would be 10x as hot as the sun, which I suggest is probably wrong. According to these numbers, the Earth would still be hot today, as there no other way to get rid of the heat other than radiating it into space.So, I don think this suggestion works.Dzugavili  5 points  submitted 2 days agoEvery such test is embarrassing because all the molecular clock tests of living fossils so far have shown the MRCA is youthful, not hundreds of millions of years old.Because 2 to the 50th power is one quadrillion, the MRCA for any individual species is youthful by mathematics: there only so many generations before the naive ancestor count exceeds the population, and so we are going to start seeing some convergence.

So it always depends on the chemical you after but it basically comes down to knowing what your chemical does and its properties. One protein I often extracted has a high positive charge and is extremely heat and acid resistant. So I grind up a heap of flowers, put them in an acid bath for a few hours, let all the chunky precipitated stuff sink to the bottom then filter the solution just to make sure all the chunky stuff is gone. I then neutralise the solution back to pH 7, boil it for a few more hours, filter the new precipitate formed and my solution now has a high concentration of my wanted protein. To finish it off I used a ionic exchange column but that a little more technical which you can read about here.

Basically, when a woman is pregnant, the placenta within her will produce a hormone that is used to help with the baby develop. Like many other things in blood, it can also be found in pee. As such, the most common types of pregnancy test strip use reagents to detect if that hormone exist in the woman pee. While it is not the most accurate method out there (sometimes people have that hormone in their blood and pee without being pregnant, like when they have certain types of cancer), it is quick and inexpensive and thus widely used.

A nice question, hopefully it should open up some discussion! I would say this is very much based on the context of the game in question and less so as a general rule of thumb. With each case there should be a cost/risk and the reward or lack of reward. The more you play and analyze your replays for successes and failures you should start to see a pattern and get a feel for it and develop a sense..

There seems to be a lot of cynism in this thread. While I can see why, this process can actually be done well and do good. All harmful things such as batteries, wiring, fabrics, etc are removed to leave only the metal component where corals can grow. 
Keep asking for advice from people, and if someone offers you help then ask for a meal for postpartum or on bed rest. You can fill your freezer with meals in foil pans. If people want to help more than that, you can also ask for help to clean your home when you are heavily pregnant or postpartum. If they really weren that willing to help, they probably find a way to back out, so don hesitate to take them up on offers of help.

Actually good netcode compared to PUBG, a jump master so the group can drop together, ability to ping the location of enemies and items instead of just calling compass directions, attachments that automatically switch to your new weapon, an inventory system with icons that tells you what you already have, popups when you pickup an item that tell you how much inventory space you have left, not having to drag items from the ground into your inventory, voice lines telling you when the circle is closing, voice lines telling you when you finished killing a squad.

It has that certain attractiveness that is so welcomed in the artistic display of information and it also features an old word used (I think) in both it older and newer ways.

Not always, it's up to your ISP to assign your IP address to the central device on your connection (usually your router). From there your router gives computers a local IP address that is just for your network. Most ISPs will go out of their way to reassign the same IP to a modem. With comcast, I won't get a new IP even if I unplug for 5 or 6 days usually (I unplug everything when I travel).
Moderation in this group is always biased FOR the OP (the person who made the post   not the commenters). For example, if an OP does not appreciate comments of a religious nature, the moderators will defend the OP boundaries. If an OP prefers comments of a religious nature, the moderators will also defend that boundary, for example. This is a support group   we are all here to support the OP. We often see commenters confused and feel that any comment should be allowed, because this is a support group. But, we are biased FOR the OP needs and boundaries. When you write your own post asking for support, we will also be biased for you.

This is caused not by discrimination, but by the fact that men: Tend to work in physically demanding and dangerous jobs more than women (and these jobs tend to pay pretty well) and are generally more aggressive when negotiating raises.

Modi made another five minute telephone call to our prime minister at the beginning of Ramazan last year, a gesture that created balmy illusions of its own. Indeed, diplomacy is all about illusions. At the end of the day, what we and largely depends on what we see in those illusions and what we feel or think about them. Whatever Modi real motives, his dramatic Lahore visit did mark the biggest surprise of all his diplomatic moves since he came to power. The people in both countries and in the region saw in Modi move a glimmer of hope for peace in their troubled region.
