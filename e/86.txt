John   I'd love to make more than I've projected! :) Thanks for the vote of confidence. I believe it was Ken McElroy (or Robert Kyosaki) who said that he doesn't wait until he knows 100% of the details in order to act   he waits until he knows 70% of what he needs to know then acts. If you over analyze a deal, if it's a good deal, the person who acted on it will be the one telling you how great it was. Ouch! Do your homework but know that you won't hit a homerun every single time you step up to the plate. Why I chose this home? The numbers worked. My mom always said "A hard head makes a soft behind."

The big problem there is that vape shops are generally not the ones selling underaged users the products. You can find Juuls in gas stations, 7 11's, and many chains across the country. If you go in to a vape shop the employees almost always actually care about the industry, and wish to protect it, meaning that they religiously ID, as was the case in the shop I worked for, and all others I have been to in my area. However, as was the case when I was 14 and bought my first pack, some random guy at the gas station who just wants to earn enough for rent and a six pack doesn't really give a shit, and is willing to just kinda look the other way for a sale. The second half of this problem was the immense amount that was being bought online by underaged users with a credit car mommy and daddy gave them, and then they ignored the bill for. (I should note that this problem has for the most part died down, as every real website for vapes in the US now requires age verification of some for further than "hey when were you born, enter the date here") Basically shitty parents were just giving their kids a card, letting them do whatever they wanted, and then when they had payed no attention for months or years and found a vape in their kids rooms they got mad that the rest of the world wasn't watching their kid for them.

Chiquita bananas, formerly known as the United Fruit Company. After their workers became unionized and went on a strike they had the police open fire on them and kill them. They even requested US troops for support, but couldn get them so just went ahead with Colombian police. This happened in Colombia in 1928 almost a hundred years ago, but the lengths they went to silence their workers was insane. For the workers it was either work or go broke, and the strike was a means of raising their wages to something livable. They straight up exploited the local people and silenced them with violence. Chiquita is a terrible fruit company and no one should ever forgive them for what they did. Estimates put the deaths caused on the day anywhere from 40 2000.

In fact, since he does something like that it now makes it more likely (although still pretty damn improbable) that he could have turned the higher straight, because if he dumb or desperate enough to count out loud (even if it as a trick), it means he not good enough to control his physical actions during a hand and/or he doesn trust his strategy enough to play like a statue so he relies on mindgames.To be clear the field is definitely mega soft in those tournaments.

When you pick up litter do you put it in a trash can for someone else in a garbage truck to pick up? Did you craft your reusable grocery bag out of twigs and leaves, or did you buy it from someone else?

In my opinion, Salman seems now to be on his way out as titular leader of the Arab/Persian/Muslim world.

A few of the casinos I've been to (except Vegas) do this, but not openly like in Tunica. Even if a casino says they will not accept other casinos chips, if you sneak it in without the dealer noticing, the casino will be able to return the chip to where it belongs and get credit for it, although it is a lot easier on them if it is from another casino in the area, as many casinos will have agreements in place with others in their vicinity..

And the point of my original post was to call out the guy I replied to because let's be honest, not a single person called him a shill (I checked replies to his post in the thread, at the time of the post) and he just comes out of the blue saying I'm not a shill in a comment chain calling out that one guy whose posts solely consist of GMO, Roundup, and Monsanto. You can give him the benefit of the doubt, but I've seen enough shady practices on Reddit to do that.

Romney responded to the latest attack by saying once again; "Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up . Who are your sources . And by the way, Harry, I understand what you're trying to do, you're trying to deflect the fact that jobs numbers are bad, that Americans are out of work, and you're trying to throw anything up on the screen that will grab attention away from the fact that the policies of the White House haven't worked to put Americans to work, and the policies of the Senate haven't even gotten a budget in place for three years." In addition, Romney proclaimed "I have paid taxes every year, and a lot of taxes, a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong and that's why I'm so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who have put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign or who knows where they're coming from.".

I was in New Orleans for a conference and had some downtime so we went on a haunted ghost tour because my friends researched it and thought it be fun. It was a good time as our guide was really good and entertaining. We got to the halfway point where we could get rehydrated or some booze. I decided to go to the bathroom and thought there was a line since there were a lot of guys on the tour. As I saw a guy wait outside, he warned me that there was a ghost in the bathroom. I didn believe him because 1) I really had to go and 2) thought he was a local yanking my chain. I eventually go inside and felt this huge weight all around my body so I quickly peed and bolted out. As I went to rejoin the group, a little boy that was with the tour was telling his mom that the bathroom felt weird. I hadn even talked to him or acknowledged him and yet he felt the same thing. The most interesting thing about this is that I got that beginning part, before peeing of course, on video as I was vlogging the trip.

I know a young man who is the product of extreme wealth and privilege. The kind of wealthy, white Southern gentleman who went to an extremely expensive and prestigious boarding school and now attends a similarly expensive college. He drives a car that costs more than my annual salary. The young man is a racist. He has actually argued that Blacks were better off during slavery. But besides being a racist, he is also tall and handsome and, not surprisingly, has an equally privileged girlfriend. This is where things get scary: the girlfriend father is an extremely successful businessman in a Southern state. The young man was extremely excited the first time he visited there because the businessman has several barns where he is warehousing enough firearms and ammunition to start the next Civil War. The stockpiling of such huge amounts of weaponry began, of course, with Obama election.
It's really hard to find that creative spark once it's nearly been beaten out of us by art school. Drawing what you're being told to draw for 3 4 years leaves you in a mental state that's like getting pulled into a black hole with no direction, nor the energy needed to get out. So you're left adrift, and as more time passes, the harder it feels to get out of that rut, to find that drive you used to have.

I remember when I saw the comic, my reaction was that it not spelling out the most important assumption for the proposal to work: the four common words must be chosen truly at random. 
I hate to be that guy, but fancy words don put you in a caloric deficit. They also don get you out on the track/pitch/whatever. It your determination and your discipline that do that. Do you have a clear plan to do what you want? Do you know what you been doing wrong? Do you have a vision of what happens when? Do you have tangible goals? You talking the talk, but are you ready to walk the walk?
But playing things like Celeste and Subsurface Circular feels good, because they small, novel, creative little worlds. 
This is often called "CGI", but technically it isn CGI would have involved the whole performance being generated by computer software, but actually all the software did was to take somebody who already looked a bit like Peter Cushing and made him look a bit more like Peter Cushing.

The weather is expected to clear up during the weekend, but temperatures will likely not break 40 degrees.
In order to retain power, assuming Margaery would be the one with primary power, she would operate in a way to have people love her, in a very Machiavellian sort of way(basing this off of her interactions with Joffrey and the "if you give them your love, they return it a thousandfold" comment and the scene with the children). Going along with the loyalty thing, white houses wouldn really follow eachother, the common folk might, and I think Margaery would use that to her advantage. The main disadvantage of House Tyrell is that Loras, as a member of the Kingsguard, wouldn marry, Garlan is already married, and I not sure what would happen to Willas.

I am suspicious that that wouldn have worked particularly well against this kid.

Then you let that little thing define you and when that little thing is mocked, you get offended/angry because it feels like a personal attack. Then you grow up some more and hopefully come down and just accept that 'not being that special' is not the same as not being important. You're important. We all are.

Particularly, it has placed a high priority on helping to negotiate a Palestinian unity agreement between Hamas and Fatah, and, reportedly, was involved in negotiating the current prisoner deal. Turkey, similarly, has been playing a far more intensive regional role in support of Palestinian rights.

A friend is usually good at sympathizing, encouraging, and telling their own stories that relate and let me know I'm not alone with something. But my therapist helps me identify healthy and unhealthy thought patterns, and find ways to recreate the first and to get out of the second. A friend might say, "I know how you feel because sometimes I also try really hard to look nice and do well and still feel like shit about myself, but just so you know, I think you're wonderful." Which is encouraging and touching, but it doesn't really land anywhere. 
Thanks. From what I gather, it all word of mouth and stuff. Lifecoach is clearly some level of good at card games and some level of rich. For various reasons, money == skill has little weight with me. Only if that money came from demonstrated skill (ex. he won a tournament for $1M).

The 217 185 House vote Thursday capped a tumultuous day in which Trump surprised fellow Republicans by insisting he won't sign a bill without the border money, after the White House had hinted he would accept it. Now, the House and Senate have passed spending measures that differ in one crucial way   the House bill includes the $5 billion Trump is demanding for a wall and the Senate version, passed a day earlier, does not.Trump says he'll only sign a spending bill with the border money, and senators of both parties say there's no chance their chamber will change its position and fund a wall.

There is also the whole morbid obsession with death. They teach that the apocalypse is literal and will happen any minute now. We are basically instructed to be ready to die at a moment notice for our faith, as well. We constantly get inundated with stories of people being killed for their faith. They also discourage higher education or any sort of trade that they believe won be useful in the world (the paradise earth that is created after the bloody battle of Armageddon). There are also frequent stories about how people became possessed by demons or were killed by demons that are told from the stage. I remember examples of things like a demon twisting someone head around because they practiced magic, or rock and roll records that screamed when they were burned in an oil drum. There is also things like people who died of preventable illnesses but refused blood transfusions being held up as martyrs.

A manuscript of the study was published online ahead of print by the journal Pain on April 29. "In other words, our results suggest that in some individuals something goes wrong with the body's 'fight or flight' response or the body recovery from this response, and persistent pain results."The study assessed the role of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, a physiologic system of central importance to the body response to stressful events.The study evaluated whether the HPA axis influences musculoskeletal pain severity six weeks after motor vehicle collision (MVC) and sexual assault.Its findings revealed that variation in the gene encoding for the protein FKBP5, which plays an important role in regulating the HPA axis response to stress, was associated with a 20 percent higher risk of moderate to severe neck pain six weeks after a motor vehicle collision, as well as a greater extent of body pain.The same variant also predicted increased pain six weeks after sexual assault.now, if an someone comes to the emergency department after a car accident, we don have any interventions to prevent chronic pain from developing, McLean said.

The major challenge for a Bot is to not be predictable. It is futile to play good if you are always playing the same. Your opponents will eventually get the upper hand. Keep in mind that players do take notes and there are also a few HUD type software that collect data on players.

It may not be the 100 percent savings you'll get at other locales like Bora Bora, Mexico, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominican Republic, or the Bahamas, but the rates do include a stay at one of the chains' best properties, plus access to the resort's Sailing Academy, Circus School (think trapeze and trampoline lessons), fitness center, tennis, basketball, and beach volleyball courts, and more.

I was listening to one where a guy who had a lot of credit card debt was asking about tithing. Of course Dave Ramsey told him tithing was a good thing to do. The thing is, he and his wife had been overspending for years and now had the credit card companies charging them interest every single month. If they used to spending 110% of their income cutting back to 100% would require a lifestyle change. Cutting back further to pay the interest they were now accruing every month would also be necessary. Add onto that cutting back even further to pay down the balance of their debt, and you already got a very strict budget with lots of sacrifices. but that not all. Oh no, they should start tithing right away! If they were going to have a difficult time getting out of debt on 100% of their income, I fail to see how giving 10% to the church and trying to make it on 90% is going to help.

In 1732, aromatic waters were further refined into cologne when Giovanni Maria Farina of Cologne, France, took over his uncle's business. Aqua Admirabilis, a lively blend of neroli, bergamot, lavender, and rosemary in grape alcohol, which has a distinct fruity scent, was used on the face and also treated sore gums and indigestion. Soldiers dubbed it "Eau de Cologne," meaning Cologne water, after the town, and the name cologne stuck to all perfumed waters since then. The rumor was that Napoleon went through several bottles a day, an endorsement that made the cologne so popular that 39 nearly identical products were created. A half century of law suits against these illegal knock off colognes followed.

Scoot, a low budget airline,has a wild livery of striking yellow and white, and it really catches the eye. However, is it TOO bright and thus off putting? I think so.

Thai Airways have a completely white livery that is saved only by the sexy purple tailfin. I do like Thai Airways colours and it stands them out from the crowd without ever being too impressive.

When adult germ free mice were colonized with normal bacteria, they continued to show reduced anxiety like behaviors, suggesting that the absence of gut bacteria early in development has a permanent effect on the brain wiring related to anxiety and exploratory behavior.14, 16In contrast, when germ free mice were colonized early in life as pups or during adolescence and then tested in adulthood, normal anxiety like behavior was observed,13, 15 suggesting that microbiota influence the way the brain is wired early in development.17In addition to studying mice, researchers have used antibiotic treatment to manipulate gut bacteria. Exposure to antibiotics in drinking water has been shown to lead to reduced numbers of gut bacteria in mice and to a reduction in the diversity of the bacterial population.18 Consistent with work in germ free mice, mice exposed to antibiotics for a single week showed increased exploratory behavior and reduced anxiety like behavior, an observation that was linked to changes in the bacterial profile.19 Two weeks following the end of the antibiotic treatment, both the bacterial profile and the behavior returned to normal, suggesting that transient changes in gut microbiota can influence behavior.19Having established connections among gut bacteria, the brain, and behavior, it is intriguing to consider the ways that microbiota may communicate with the brain.

I wouldn bother with prior visits. Just make sure the cat has some places where it can get away from the dog   a hiding place, a high surface, etc. If the cat has some hiding places, it can pretty much take care of itself. It would be a shit situation, if the cat had no place to hide. That could cause hostility and too much stress. Keeping the car and the dog in separate rooms for a few days might help too. Adjusting to a new space is already stressful, so if the dog can be kept separate for a few days, it might be helpful for the cat.
Many times when we just wake up with a stiff neck after one night of sleeping in the wrong position it is just that our muscles have gotten stiff and we need to get some blood flow to them in order to alleviate the pain. If you find yourself in the position that you wake up with a stiff neck, the worst thing you can do is not move it; however, it is equally as bad to try and jam your neck into certain positions that it does not want to go.

Randomisation with juking should only work if you don believe you can out level your opponent.

I mentioned on another thread that casting a non white actor in a role explicitly described as white by the source material seems to hold more inherent biases than simply casting a white actor. This, in turn, makes things more complicated than they should be. If no "political biases" were applied, casting would probably go something like this: Character described as white by source material  > Open a casting call for white actors  > Cast best actor out of this bunch. Two step casting.

Und Du solltest in der Lage sein das nachher nachzuweisen, sonst stehst Du sehr dumm da, wenn der Kunde Dich wegen Freiheitsberaubung und Ntigung anzeigt, oder einfach von seinem Notwehrrecht Gebrauch macht, und Deine Nase hin ist.
