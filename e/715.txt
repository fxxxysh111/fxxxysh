So giving the benefit of the doubt is usually best as it would be really shitty to have someone call you out for faking your medical condition.2) I don have experience with witnessing someone fake a seizure but I would imagine a good indication would be the post ictal (after the seizure stops) phase. Someone who just had a convulsive seizure where they lose consiousness will typically be very confused as to what happend afterward, where they are, etc. And will be tired and sometimes nauseous.

However, solvers are very, very useful to help choose proper bluff candidates and help understand range vs. range interaction on certain boards. I also found that just the work of setting up the tree and the critical thinking required to interpret and simplify outputs improves my understanding of the game greatly, which has improved my results both online and live. But the only reason these guys are at that level is because the competition forces them to do so and it sink or swim. Unfortunately, the truth is as a live player you going to always be behind the progression of the game simply because your competition is weak (compare with Stars NLz pools) and you going to prefer playing and printing your hourly over solver work. People using solvers effectively aren using them to follow the equilibrium strat exactly, and the ones that are usually give up as its an overwhelming futile approach. Equilibrium, even pseudo equilibrium that a solver provides, is way too complicated to follow exactly. Despite this, using solvers to craft your strategy is a worthwhile endeavor. As you work more and more in a solver, patterns emerge. You develop an instinctive feel for how you should play and how villain should play given the range v. range interaction. As you start to see how far we deviate from equilibrium, your nodelocking work should help you understand how to best counter your opponents.

I spray spray spray regularly, dry things off regularly, and wipe everything with a cleaning wipe about once a week (and just a bit here or there daily) and the actual scrubbing is reduced to once every few weeks.The more you hate it, the more often you should do it to avoid it becoming a big job. Do a big clean once to make it sparkly once and then just keep it up with lots of frequent wipes and sprays.I have a scrubber ducky (brush that looks like rubber ducky) in the shower for a bit of a scrub in between washing my hair and the kid enjoys helping, too.If you have glass shower walls, gods help you.

I am not interest in going through history and and comparing people who claimed to have followed each ideology because as I stated many times, people can say one thing, but act a completely different way.

My argument is centered around comparing the lives of these two people because on the most basic level, these are the people each respective religion followers are suppose to emulate.

Hidden secret number two: Professional poker players don't bet on every hand. Poker players that have constant success take their time and don't flood bets in. They are confident in their skills to read players that they don't have to bet on every "possible" hand they could get. They usually bet on hands like pocket aces, or high suited cards. Don't make the mistake that I use to make and bet because I had royalty. I usually would bet on a Q,9 or a J,8 I have found that cards like this, don't pay off. It is rare that they will pay off however. When you show others that you're not betting on any old thing that comes through, your bets will have more weight and you'll be considered more conservative. So when you do bet, and bluff, you will be taking more seriously. Learning this secret has enabled my poker wins to jump, even when some people don't bet against me. Remember the price of something goes up if its rare, if you bet rarely, it will be weighted more.

Academics live lives isolated from much of the debates and issues that structure the world outside of academe.

Player gets dealt a big ace (AK); when the flop appears they hit none of their hoped for cards, then make the dreaded mistake of calling big bets still hoping to hit on the turn, and they miss their needed cards completely on the turn as well, but for some strange reason continue to call bets. They don't realize that only a high card hand is pretty weak without a pair, flush or straight, because any made hand beats a AK high hand. The golden rule is know when you're beat and fold! Of course, a pro is going to play AK, too   but he is going to pop it pretty good pre flop to get heads up, preferably so people suspect he has a pocket pair, then nothing hits, but he still has the bluff, because he made believers by betting hard pre flop, with a good reputation..

The game of poker is by far the most popular form of card playing worldwide. In fact, there are so many different ways to play poker that it can practically entertain its own category in card playing. Poker style games can be tracked back as far as ten centuries from similar games which contained poker like rules and the use of bluffing as part of a method for success. The most popular history assumption of poker is that it was originated by Chinese around 950AD which they called "domino cards". This of course was not the same game you see today or any of its variations for the matter. Most all early variations of poker where similar in many ways and then were enhanced and mixed into what many of play today.

FAST INDUCTION), you want one that has low blood solubility since it starts spilling over into your brain faster.Next, let talk about lipid solubility. The principle is similar to blood solubility: highly soluble = can "sink" lots of anesthetic into fatty tissue AND crosses the blood brain barrier faster (because it can cross lipid membranes more easily). Therefore, if you want a fast acting anesthetic, you want 1) low blood solubility, and 2) high lipid solubility.There is a catch: if the anesthetic is highly lipid soluble, over time, it will redistribute (via circulatory system) from the brain to fatty tissues.

In IL fingerprints are not mandatory at the present time but are recommended to expedite and shorten the duration of the FCCL approval process. Martin possibly thought that he was in the clear since the less rigorous FOID vetting didn't uncover his 1995 felony conviction in MS and sought to fast track his FCCL application.

5. At my age, (44) I've also found I've had to keep this maintenance up and it hasn't given me problems.

The adult mammalian brain produces new neurons in the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus throughout life. Many extrinsic and intrinsic (epi)genetic factors can regulate the production of new neurons [48]. Increasing evidence indicates that this process has a role in learning and memory. Ablation of the new cells results in spatial memory deficits [49]. In addition, using markers for immediate early gene expression it has been shown that the new cells are preferentially activated during learning tasks [50]. Furthermore, an increase in neurogenesis is associated with improved cognition. The strongest neurogenic stimulus is exercise. Wheel running in rodents results in a 3 4 fold or even greater increase in the production and survival of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus [30]. The onset of the effect of running on cell genesis is rapid. Cell genesis peaks at three days. After 32 days of running the pro proliferative effect has returned to baseline. Interestingly, the number of immature neurons continues to increase at this time point
