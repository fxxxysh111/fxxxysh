Speaking of the last, make sure your work product is being uploaded shared someplace you have access. Dropbox Google drive are common, but there may be others that work better for you: know the rules of 'ownership' of files on these platforms. 
You are missing the point. I give up my freedom to murder and burn shit down however I please by being a part of society, and in exchange I get yadda yadda. If I no longer get anything in exchange for it, then clearly there no reason for me to hold up my side of the bargain, either.
So I googled for maybe 30 45 minutes and found the main problem on macOS. MacOS finder and all programs with UIs who are using same APIs as finder assume that Samba understands macOS specific SMB commands. Of course a standard Samba server does not understand that and so delays happen in the process.

When it started pouring rain around dinnertime, we were still on the road and we were a little bummed out. We stopped for dinner at a random roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere at 8 pm. Our waiter was really cute so we invited him to sit with us and have a cup of team. Unfortunately he spoke hardly any English, but when Wendi went to the bathroom, I was pretty sure that he had invited us to sleep at his house. I was a little embarrassed to clarify this (what if that is not what he had asked me?!) but by miming and with his limited English and our limited Turkish, we realized that he really had invited us. Well the speeding ticket had put a dent in our pocket so we thought "Why not?" and we all drove to his house.

The Paleo Coach embraces the rote physiology espoused by the paleo community that we're maladapted to the modern high carb diet, and that we need to convert to a predominantly meat and veggie meal plan but Seib's efforts to motivate us to do so are fresher and more compelling than the usual paleo lit. He spends the first third of the book drilling on the reasons we want to change our diet, trying to nudge readers away from the compulsion to get a hot body and refocus on being healthy; the beach physique, he contends, will follow.
Stop by and see our extensive frame collections4. If you scheduled an annual eye exam, plan to have your eyes dilated. A dilation allows the optometrist to better assess the health of the back of your eye. After the dilation, you will not be able to read clearly and you'll be sensitive to light. Your eyes will return to normal in approximately 4 to 6 hours. Please bring sunglasses and do not plan to drive until your eyes return to normal.5. If you cannot be dilated at the time of your exam, a retinal image (Optos) is available for an additional charge. The retinal image can be taken without dilation drops (hence it will not impair your vision). It can reveal to the optometrist more of your ocular health though it does not reveal as much as a full dilated eye exam. Your optometrist may recommend that both tests be conducted.

Suddenly as I lying there I feel warm, wet, liquid squirt onto my back over the towel and over my singlet. It was a no oil massage, and I have had a boyfriend for two years in the past, I know what that stuff feels like landing anywhere on my body. I then heard him zip up his pants and at this point im completely frozen and disgusted and scared thinking how vulnerable I am. I lie there for a bit and pretend to get a neck cramp and he tries to keep going and I say I can and apologize and say it wasn his fault my neck just cramps up sometimes. I go pay and grab my stuff (they stole one of my shopping bags) but I did not care I just wanted to get away from there.

Because OMC plays so few pots, he doesn actually contribute to the jackpot/promotion pool. If the casino ran bad beat jackpots with large table percentage and ran hot seat (random draw) promotions primarily instead of high hand (which involves getting in the pot), that another advantage.

I all for a band changing their sound, and this album is mostly effective, but when a band is signed to Julian Casablancas record label, who then produces their album, and the band starts sounding so specifically like him, it disheartening.

The second listen was effective for me to get over it and realize it not as invasive as it seemed at first, but it still prevalent enough to be bothersome to me.

Once popular in many online bingo sites only as mini games, slot games have changed the way people view such sites. Today, these games are not merely an additional attraction but very much a part of all the major online bingo sites. A bingo site without the presence of even a couple of slots and other instant games is exceptional in the present times and not in a good way. With many sites opting for exclusive promotions for slot games, the popularity that online bingo sites enjoy in the world of online gaming has managed to ride much higher on the strong shoulders of the slot games.

NOf course, this probability changes as the game progresses: it decreases when any of the tens, jacks, queens, kings, or aces get discarded, but increases when other cards get discarded. This change is unpredictable, but its expected value is 0; this is a complicated concept to explain, but it means that on average, the probability will go up as much as it goes down.

Proponents of the game state that the effects of the televised tournaments toward society are positive. Enough to where a person can find "family nights" for playing being offered by organizations promoting the game.

Kids and teenagers with guidance can learn how to plan strategy, manage money, solve complex problems and understand the psychology of human beings. But every coin has two sides. A concerned number of people are voicing the opinion that the creation of gambling addicts is taking place. More and more land based and online casinos are taking this seriously by offering help for gambling addiction and the creation of new programs for assistance for those who have problem issues. Having help available for players will become increasingly important as the enthusiasm of the game goes forward.

I don't have much actual useful advice for you, just wanted to offer a different perspective. I don't think your wife is necessarily being a terrible person or spouse, and neither are you. Eight months might sound like a long time, but having a baby is a life changing event and you're both still trying to figure out your new lives (especially her). This isn't the time to make demands, it's a time to communicate more. Your wife isn't trying to neglect you specifically, she's just consumed by the baby and very likely has lost some of her sense of self just as much as she's lost some of her connection to you. Don't just talk at her about your feelings, also make sure to find out how she's feeling. And don't just try to talk to her about your relationship, ask her about how she's doing in general. Sometimes it's useful to have information gathering conversations first, and then digest that, before moving on to problem solving conversations.

We called in our friend Kris, who was a native speaker, to verify before we told her what it actually meant.He took one look at her paper with her carefully copied characters and blurted out "Slut?!".Yep. 
The importance of natural plant products for cognition has been underestimated, in part because the active ingredient(s) in the plant extracts remained unknown, limiting data interpretation. In the majority of studies the compounds under investigation are a mixture of ingredients in which the most potent factor is likely to be diluted. Indeed, animal studies were often performed in aged rodents or transgenic mouse models for neurodegenerative disease [43] because compounds had minimal effects in normal young subjects [44].

It considered to be the start of Ajax golden age that lasted until the 70s.And the reason Veltman came on that late is twofold.

Mij lijkt het bijvoorbeeld een beter idee om op iedere lokale omroep een apart debat te hebben met lijsttrekkers voor de desbetreffende provincie. Zo komen alleen de standpunten aan bod die er daadwerkerlijk toe doen, en kunnen kijkers zich dus ook echt goed orinteren over hun stemkeuze n zich laten informeren over wat er speelt in de provincie.

In contrast, the health related quality of life model (HRQL) places the patient function and well being rather than a disease at its center of focus. This patient oriented paradigm, reviewed by Wilson and Cleary10 in 1995, is gaining increasing acceptance and influence. It offers a sound foundation in the current literature to substantiate a chiropractic approach to health care.
So the decision to remake What Women Want   a film that, despite starring Mel Gibson, is so exemplary of these tendencies of Meyers as a filmmaker   is not one that should be made without considered thought. Her string of 1990s and early 2000s romantic comedies have become oft parodied contemporary classics for a reason. Much like the early 20th century screwball comedies Meyers's films hark back to (or, attempt to update with a modern sheen and penchant for women clad in high end neutral basics), her directorial style is unobtrusive and distinctively breezy.

The Wanderers "Wobbly" struck big time on the fourth as balls going through rather than bad skittling was the cause of us reaching a low total 51 to lose 7 pins. This was quickly put right on the fifth hand as 9's each from Billy Food Chain and a 13 spare from Skipper Hake helped to a 65 hand and regain 8 pins back to now lead by 22. A sixth hand 60 seemed to be a holding hand, but Naps then found some form and hit their highest hand of the night of 70 to pull ten pins and cut our lead to 12.

Not ever having bought a property that the seller wanted to use a 1031 exchange, there are very fine rules about a properties title in the transfer of a 1031 exchange. The property must be in the sellers full name, not a business name. LESSON 9 FELLOW NEWBIES: Don't just know of facets of things like 1031's, learn as much as you can about them so you can catch things on the up front rather than the backend. The contract I signed was between me and the seller however, the title of the property was under his businesses name. It took almost a week for him to work with his lawyer/closing attorney to get it mailed to my closing attorney so that they could record the new title in my county so that the 1031 would be able to take place. All the mean while my rate lock was expiring after a 2 week extension from my lender on April 30. Had to close by then.

Also, even more plant based protein would have to be consumed to make sure the population gets all 9 amino acids (a complete protein diet) as soy is low in methionine and lysine and is therefore not a "complete protein", contrary to what vegans claim.

Capitalism is a proxy for god/fate/destiny and "the way life is" but communism actually tries to alter the status quo where people suffer and die needlessly. Because communism actually tried to make life better and sometimes didn't succeed, it's much much worse than capitalism, which never claimed to value human life in the first place. Their logic is undeniable; just keep parroting "100 million fucking deaths" while burning fossil fuels, cooking the planet, and profiting from the horrors that await..

I was so disappointed when it started to disintegrate. It had great potential but they paid no attention to their world building, it was all butt jokes and worst of all (to me) was the badger actor actively trying to ruin the improv.

Moon made it to the heads up finale with a string of improbable TKOs, including one of highly touted pro Phil Ivey, who went out in seventh place, and then Begleiter. Those two knockouts came in rapid succession, and both times Moon held ace queen, was behind at the start and then got just the card he needed. In Ivey's case, Moon faced an ace king but won when he paired his queen. 
But this was a deal I found off the market, closed without a realtor, found a bank that would give me financing all while working a full time job.

This is where your anti bluff strategy comes into play; you don't want to show them too much strength at first because they may label you as a strong player and not try to bluff you. Give them a chance to take advantage of your supposed poker weaknesses, when in fact you have a strong read on them and you may benefit by letting them bluff one too many times and you will stack your opponent's chips.. 
You can however 'read' his hand based on the board, betting tells, past behaviors, etc. When you have a solid read, say he is drawing to a flush on the flop, you know that he has a chance of 0.35 to improving and therefore you have a winning chance of 0.75 ( with for example a pair of aces..

But the most eye popping rises have come in recent decades amid an era of mega casino resorts that began when Steve Wynn opened the Mirage in 1989. 
Player gets dealt a big ace (AK); when the flop appears they hit none of their hoped for cards, then make the dreaded mistake of calling big bets still hoping to hit on the turn, and they miss their needed cards completely on the turn as well, but for some strange reason continue to call bets. They don't realize that only a high card hand is pretty weak without a pair, flush or straight, because any made hand beats a AK high hand. The golden rule is know when you're beat and fold! Of course, a pro is going to play AK, too   but he is going to pop it pretty good pre flop to get heads up, preferably so people suspect he has a pocket pair, then nothing hits, but he still has the bluff, because he made believers by betting hard pre flop, with a good reputation..

I think one thing you and your husband may want to spend some time contemplating (you may have already) is if you feel called to foster vs feeling called to adopt. While both are incredibly important, they are distinctly different. The hardest lesson I've had to learn since we've started fostering is that reunification with biofamily is ALWAYS the goal.

I can relate to a lot of the things you mentioned, and that good advice about proceeding at your own pace and not being afraid to take some days "off" to just relax and decompress and not feel the need to always rush to the next tourist attraction, next bar, next town, etc.And about needing to interact with people. That the part I really failed on in my trip, and being in a hostel only exacerbated it because I still didn interact, only now I felt like I was a failure for it rather than just a solo traveler lacking opportunities.

So Mehmet arrives and he is really funny, but also 45! We all leave together in Mehmet's car and literally, 20 meters from the restaurant the tire went completely flat! It was POURING rain (of course). Wendi and I were nice and held umbrellas over them while they changed the tire (well, ok, we had just accepted a feast from them so I suppose it was more like our duty!). Well Wendi had a cold and Mustafa insisted that she get medicine. Ignoring our protests, we drove all over Istanbul and finally went to a HOSPITAL where Mustafa was able to get a prescription for Wendi without her ever seeing a doctor. Okayyyyyso then we were off to find an open pharmacy (and at this point it was past midnight) and we finally found one. After filling Wendi's prescription, Mehmet took us back to his apartment. Wendi and I slept in one room together and locked the door, but we found the whole experience a little odd. We slept until almost noon and then Mehmet and Mustafa took us to breakfast and their friend Ahmet joined us. He was a dead ringer for Antonio Banderas! I swear, you can't make this stuff up.

Occasionally adapted by wrapping this all in a flour tortilla too, as a Mexican flavored egg salad wrap. Not really unusual to combine eggs and salsa, but I never seen cold (mayo based) egg salad and salsa offered anywhere on a menu. Really good.

If it pushes too hard, it will only strengthen the MQM rock solid base of support in Karachi. If it doesn push at all, it will have to continue playing poker with the Raabita Committee of the MQM.

The idea that in order for one person to profit another must lose is just plain wrong and you can ask any economist or mathematician. It entirely possible to provide a product or service without actively creating harms in the process. The notion that negative externalities aren the business problem is a relatively new idea that prospered under the new rein of, "regulation is evil".

The technology acquires brain signals through an implanted, 96 channel electrode array. Each channel detects voltage that is continuously generated from active neurons in its neighborhood. The sampling rate is 30kHz; this means that the number of voltage measurements that we collect is 30,000 per second and this streams continuously in real time while Ian uses the system. 
The film's main flaw is that the lead, Paul Massie, isn't strong enough an actor to convincingly play both Jekyll and Hyde, a fact made apparent when he is surrounded by actors of such calibre as Christopher Lee (possibly the definitive Dracula) and Oliver Reed in an early, uncredited film role. 
Though in retrospect I can see red flags. We moved in together and he started to show abusive tendencies.

While much of Phuket is overbuilt, the JW Marriott, the island's newest luxury resort, faces ten miles of Mai Khao beach that will never be developed because they're part of the Sirinath Marine National Park, the protected breeding grounds of endangered leatherback turtles. (The resort was constructed so its lights don't shine on the beach, which would confuse female turtles laying their eggs and hatchlings when they try to find their way to the ocean.) Here you can walk for miles and see no one. The Marriott's spa is run by Mandara, the Bali based spa company. The ten couple's treatment suites include indoor and outdoor space, which is good for pairs who have different temperature preferences. Notable treatments: Healing Hot Stones massage ($108) and Thai massage($61) therapist Upadee Tansom is slender but has extraordinarily strong hands. Guest rooms are large and elegant, with great ocean views and raised sala areas with massage mats and triangular cushions. Thumbs down: the cuisine, especially the breakfast buffet.

I agree with the part about if those are the only two games that interest OP, skip. FPS's and Racers are actually games that IMO don't translate extremely well to the hardware.

Sweet baby Jesus this is impressive, good for you man! I see a lot of similarities to myself in your post, I graduated with an accounting degree at 22 with no student debt and started out making $55k/year. I'm 27 making $101k right now and don't have anywhere near your net worth but I was pretty lazy about saving until last year. 2019 is the first of many years I plan to max my ira and 401k annually. I'd love to stick more away but the wife and I want some big flashy things in the near future that we are also saving for.

Imposing targeted rates, says the Auckland Ratepayers'rates, but it offers no relief to the eternally sufferingJournalism Has A Problem: It's Called CapitalismMuch has been written of late about the 'problems' of the Journalism industry and in particular the impacts of consolidation and layoffs on local news coverage. However, I would propose that to the extent that Journalism does in fact have a problem, that problem is simply an extension of the market failures of Capitalism. And to the extent that solutions exist, they must be solutions that allow journalism to move outside of the broken system that has caused this situation.

Now regarding Kate, I think the show has done a relatively good job at showing some of the difficulties related to being overweight. They they have focused more on the mental aspect over the physical aspect. The reason for this I guessing is because those kinds of difficulties are not something most people notice normally, everyone can see that the overweight person can walk very well, gets tired and all those things, but the mental aspect, not so much.
This is unfortunately true. 
Why is it acceptable for the people we are reaching out to, to dictate to us how to live? I would cut their funding.

It's an evolutionary adaptation that keeps us cooperating, considerate, and safe. There's a reason one of the most memorable scenes in all of "Game of Thrones" was Cersei's naked walk through the town square, pelted with food and human waste, to a group chanting one word: "Shame!".

As rumors grew of Russian interference, I grew more and more paranoid. The paranoia, suspicion, and desire for radical action I felt towards the changes in government were mirrored in how I felt towards my employers and changes they were trying to make in my job. I rebelled in loud and open ways, channeling my anger towards society towards management. All the while I felt safe in doing so, as I held an important role and was being trained for another position in the company.
My best friend had twin brothers that passed away one day and one month after their birth, respectively. He (then about years old) and some family members were sitting graveside and attending the funeral of the first when they received a call telling them to halt the funeral because they needed to get to the hospital to say goodbye to the other one. They rushed to the hospital, said goodbye, and his mother held the baby while he died..

Additionally, you also can put trans people in their assigned at birth category, since they will suffer from a heavy disatvantage due to hormones effects compared to someone who trains just as much as them. This would basically put trans people on the spot: Decide, either transition or choose sports if you want to have a chance. Which imo would be a pityful fate..

This list would not be complete without including ultimate pop princess Britney Spears. Her fame exploded at the age of 17 with her first Hot 100 mega hit "Baby One More Time" in 1999.

I went to VCU and worked in the film/TV industry for several years in Richmond. While it gave me lots of good experience, I ended up moving to Los Angeles because I wasn working often enough and there didn seem to be any room to advance my career. Because the market is so small there (usually one movie/tv series shooting at a time), certain people have a monopoly on the good paying positions and, understandably, won be vacating them any time soon.

Did you know that people are a lot more likely to die by suicide if they have a parent that did? It's not just genetics, like you're more likely to be depressed because it's hereditary. If you have a parent that dies by suicide, it messes with you and makes you more likely to do it yourself. Suicide in general is kind of contagious, and knowing that has stopped me from wanting to do it myself   I wouldn't want to think that I might be making someone I love more likely to want to die..

I understand looking in the mirror and seeing someone different everytime. Even now, I feel like Alice in Wonderland, constantly changing size and shape, every sip of water showing to the world. But really, it not like that. No one sees the things I do because they aren actually real. There are treatments that will help and even though I still see things wrong or just feel like my body is wrong, through treatment I was able to find the tools to work through those feelings when they occur. So can you. And it so much easier to learn better coping mechanisms when you haven been ingrained in harmful thought patterns for years.

On basic graduation night, one of the girls on EC had a mental break (her fianc didn't come from NY), and the flight woke up to her trying to smother a random flight member. We had to restrain her (she was an imposing character of 6'0) and try to get an MTI from CQ to come to us, but she had bashed the comms with her M 16, so we, nave as ever, had to take a vote on if we thought this was something we should break the rules and run downstairs for, or if we should restrain her in the laundry room until morning. We didn't want to lose our town pass for the next day, but we ended up sending runners for help.
