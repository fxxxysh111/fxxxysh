When I watched this a while back, I remember I was basically just reading subtitles the whole time and trying to keep up, constantly getting confused between who Jim and who Jules is (which may have been the filmmakers' intention). The film is densely packed with dialogue   both narration and character dialogue   and by reading for most of the film it kind of took away from the impressive visuals. I imagine for a french speaker it must be a delightful watch, but I was struggling to be honest.

I work at a methadone clinic and have seen many people taper off methadone. The whole modality has flaws, but getting off is 100% possible. I think it really common for people to hit a wall while tapering, where they trucking along and cutting 100mg off their dose 5mg at a time for a long while and then all of a sudden it like the brain picks up on what happening and goes, "NAH." I always warn people it coming and recommend they go back up to the dose they last felt normal at and hang out there for at least 1 month, and then drop 2mg and see how they feel.

I used to let my dad win at video games all the time when I was little. He loved playing but he was hopeless and I felt bad bullying him when we played against each other. So every other game or so I would purposely make huge mistakes. I swing at bad pitches to strike out in baseball, hold the ball too long and get sacked in football, purposely run over his traps or let him run me off the road in racing games, purposely whiff big moves in fighting games, etc. He would laugh and laugh when I made a dumb mistake or he got the upper hand and say, "I gotcha that time, buddy!" Sometimes he pat me on the back and say "Can win all!" It made him so happy that I actually enjoyed losing, but I was careful not to do it so often he knew I was letting him.

But in today's world of instant information, supercomputers and interconnected markets, true arbitrage profits earned with zero risk after all possible costs rarely, if ever, exists. Most arbitrage involves some form of cost or risk (risk of buying at the wrong price, risk of paying high transaction costs, liquidity, etc). Let's look at a simple example:

Doesn't always happen that way since it's not a perfect world, but that is the way the system is designed to work. It's true that it is possible to adopt from the foster system and if this is your end goal, my best advice is to make that known up front. 
I agree that poker has similarities to sports betting but it's not something that anyone can pick up and be profitable. There is intense hand analysis/review, putting in long grinds, and calculating pot odds/equity as the very basic requirement to becoming profitable. The fact that you can go to work and lose money is a psychological barrier for some people as well.

The rectum, once it's ready, literally swallows the penis up and can't get enough. If the clitoris and/or vagina are stimulated while your man is inside you, it can take you to another sexual realm. It pretty intense, no matter what, and the increased tightness back there makes it just that much better.

Things like developing emotional intelligence, learning to see through our own bs by developing integrity, and stabilizing core values of being loving to the world by first being loving towards ourselves. It takes smart women to really navigate new obstacles in a graceful way, so maybe something that we could focus on more is becoming smarter.

To say this movie looks dark would be an understatement. The question it asks is one that thankfully most parents never have to face: How far would you go for your children? When the daughter of Keller Dover (Jackman) and her friend go missing, he turns to Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) to find her. That endeavor turns out to be a dead end, and with time running out, he takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the only suspect in the case. He'll stop at nothing to find the children, but how far is too far? Aside from one ridiculous character name (seriously, Loki?), this movie looks really solid.
The problem, in my opinion, with tools like Juul is that they reenforces the habit. 
Hillary revealed in her foundations tax returns that they took donations from questionable governments. Donald Trump won even release his tax returns.

For the NL variants, I would expect one to beat the lower stakes by modeling the market and the higher stakes by modeling individual players. As there are sites logging each hand played on the major sites, it would be interesting to see whether it would be possible to beat players by making their simulacra from that data and train bots by pitting them against those simulacra.2) It has intriguing property that like Go and Chess, it is easy to dispense with the real time constraint and in lieu of modeling human players, create synthetic experience. That would make it a lot easier to master than say League of Legends.It is not just real time being slow, but also there is the computational burden of deal with all the visual and auditory data.

Well I don like the idea of being addicted to caffeine so I think I going to give it a break and see how I go. I have a hot Milo in the morning instead. I might have been pretty dumb but I didn think about getting addicted to caffeine even though I knew that was a thing. I don get a buzz from coffee I just like the taste and it become a morning ritual so I guess I thought that since I don feel the effects of caffeine I probably wasn addicted to it. Perhaps this resistant headache proves otherwise.

Could she have gone up to her son room to check on him after the abortion was attempted and left blood? I just think the abortion theory makes the most sense. Her husband was away perfect time to schedule it, she walked her daughter and friend to the neighbors so they wouldn witness but kept the baby since he wouldn know what was going on and not to arouse neighbor of something going wrong and her needing to get both kids out of the house. Maybe she didn walk the 3 miles to the highway. Since the blood trail ends at the car, the person who was with her drove her out there to look for a place to bury the fetus and realized she was dying too and just left her? I could be (and probably am) completely wrong but the abortion theory to me, has the least holes.

The same would apply for very "white" looking folks of other "non white" races, who do not have any actual white heritage (I've met people from all over the Middle East and South Asia who could pass for white). And at that point, I think you're creating divisions that could be harmful for communities especially when factoring in culture and religion, which like it or not, do interact with appearance to determine how one is treated. Besides, often, there will be disagreement as an average white person, I don't think Jojo's mom looks white.

A partial counter to being outflanked is to pinwheel hard to counter the outflankers, sometimes augmented with JJ. Deploy all of your ships at speed 1. If your opponent sets up to outflank you to your left, then on turn 1 drop down to speed zero on the left flank, and turn up to speed 2 on the right flank. Then on turn 2 turn the engine back on so that you have some defenses ready when you start taking fire on turn 2 (or 3).

As a recovering addict, I'll tell you that initiating early recovery is a singular pursuit. No one can "do" another person's recovery for them that all has to come from him.

It a fact that the majority of American do not support Trump and his Policies and even more true in intellectual circles any legitamate speakers list is going to skew heavily liberal for this reason.

These types of poker games also have limited betting but it is not predetermined, rather the limit is set to the current size of the pot. As the pot grows so does the betting limit.

Ignoring lands, Hearthstone and Magic have similar issues with lucky/unlucky draws and topdecking, but I mention one area where Magic has more effective randomness, for the better: The prevalence of instant spells in Magic, declaring blockers, and interactivity during your opponent turn more generally, means that there much greater uncertainty when you make an offensive play. And that what makes Magic great.

Well its just a stupid answer. Yes the rich well off people making 30$+ an hour can afford a house by themselves, but because I "only" make 20$/hr I can buy a house? Even a small cheap one? Not everyone is happy to live the rest of their life renting or living in an apartment. And making 20$ 25$ is something lots of people can do but getting into the 30 is not an easy feat and usually its the already well off people who are going into those jobs.

This classical view of top down control that is, the brain's ability to control gut function is supported by evidence revealing that the brain influences body systems, including the GI tract, through neural connections of the autonomic nervous system and through humoral systems in the bloodstream. Both of these communication pathways are activated in stressful situations and influence gut function.

Many people that play poker enjoy playing a number of locations. For example, you might find poker games going on in people's homes, activity centers, and back yards.

Also no proof in the affidavit that he solicited anything from the women. It is possible that this could have been a legal and consensual act between adults and there does not seem to be evidence to prove otherwise. So the facts supporting a misdemeanor charge of solicitation really don't jump out at you.
There may be another factor at play. As has been pointed out on this (and other sites), a fairly large number of slow witted folk get hired in the EFL game. So there is an underlying assumption that foreign teachers are a little slow.

Hair. so weighty, so important, so central to our presentation of self in the modern world. years I have dyed mine radically different colors as a sort of social experiment  trying to disrupt the notion that anyone has "naturally" bright blond hair by dying it dark brown the next time, or red, or strawberry blond. I learned is that if my hair is blonder than "dark blond" people treat me differently  as if I stupid or a child. in hardware stores are much more likely to help me. on the street are much more likely to make comments. I a brunette or a dark red, people act as if I smart. in hardware stores ask me for help. dark blond or light brown make me nearly invisible  neither sexy nor smart  just a blank slate which I must fill out with sartorial signifiers and actions.

These promises of democracy sound quaint these days in the US, with a populace so uninformed that they are easily misled by demagogues and charlatans into acting in the most undemocratic of ways. what is to blame for the breakdown of civility and citizenship in America? like to blame it all on Fox News and the likes of Glenn Beck and Rush LImbaugh, but the truth is erosion of American democracy predates the appearance of fascism. the Undemocratic began with the destruction of equal opportunity that was contained in the educational system. the 20th century progressed, education became the engine of American democracy. children and young people out of factories and mandating public high school educations lifted an entire generation of Americans out of sweatshop labor. World War II, the GI Bill sent tens of thousands of working men into universities. the 1970s, the American educational system was increasingly open to women and/or Black and Latino Americans.

This may not seem like the biggest deal in the world, I know other husbands cheat on their wives, but I get really upset because we have a history of his lying. We've been married for six years and about 1 1/2 years in, I found out he had an ongoing secret habit, involving women but not sex, I won't say what exactly it is but it's on par with his going to a strip club every week and not telling me about it. Really shocking for a wife to find out, made me think about divorce, but it wasn't cheating so I was willing to work it out with him in couples therapy, which we did for over a year. About six months into therapy, I was out of town for 10 days DH (dear husband) hung out at a bar with his best friend (who is a womanizer cheater) a couple women, I don't doubt that nothing happened, but what bothered me so much was that he didn't tell me, if he had just told me, it would have been annoying but not such a big deal.

The instrumentation on this album is much easier to pick apart than on Peasant, with everything being precisely put into place.

The most commonly accepted derivations of 'Lore' or 'Lure' are 'treacherous' or 'deceitful', as well as 'fairies'; but as with most old names, nothing is certain and other explanations exist.

The Old High German2 name Lurlaberch or 'Mons Lurlaberch' (Mount Lurlaberch) was mentioned by a monk Ruodolf in about the middle of the 9th Century in the Annales Fuldenses3.

So in the Life of Pi, the Indian kid and main character Pi was stranded alone on a boat for 12 months with no one or nothing but a tiger, who he named Richard Parker. Now the common nickname for a fella named Richard, we all know is Dick. When this data is interpolated, it gives the name Dick Parker. For an Indian orphan stranded alone on a boat with no one or nothing but a tiger, does anyone else think it is strange that Pi named the tiger Dick Parker?

I don know what there is in this engraving that speaks "color" to me when it should probably be just concerning itself with the blackness of its deep black (which for me is usually the case). Neither the blackness nor the dimensionality of the thing it seems to give itself some height and depth at the same time say anything louder than the representation of its missing colors, which we are clearly seeing nothing of in these wavelengths except that there really aren any colors here outside of the beautiful black white. contrast is certainly there ("There are dark shadows on the earth, but its lights are stronger in the contrast." Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers), especially in the corner bits, where on closer inspection the blackness is really more white than black. In any event, the print suggests "color" to me for no good reason, except perhaps that it looks very cold, and cold is suggestive of ice blue, and the good contrast for that is yellow. "The sound of colors is so definite that it would be hard to find anyone who would express bright yellow with base notes, or dark lake with the treble." so wrote Mr. Kandinsky, who saw colors in his sound, and who in the midst of things wrote four experimental pieces of theater based upon this observation, the first and perhaps most prominent of which was called "Yellow" (1909). that is why this old engraving seems "yellow" to me (and this without any benefit of synesthesia).

You close your lid or the computer goes into Sleep Mode and then when it tries coming out it locks up. This can be caused by the O2Micro Integrated MMC/SD controller (For many Dell laptops) or basically your SD controller driver conflicting with some other OS software. You can find this under Device Manager / Storage controllers.
Ah, happy resolution time. Hooker and the gang hang out in the station watering hole, sharing drinks and toasting with champagne. The chick cop is there too, and we clink drinks and freeze for credits, everybody all happy smiles. Next week on TJ Hooker, Hooker brings down the bad guys and saves the day and the girl. That episode wasn't as much campy fun as the one before, but that's okay. I am totally hooked. I hated TJ Hooker back in the day, but now it's just damn funny, all ludicrous campy goodness. :) Thanks for indulging my attempt at TVWP ness. :)

Contrary to popular belief, our dislike of women and minorities in our video games is generated by our love for history, we do not hate them "just because" as some of you might believe. You would feel different about us, had you know what our reactions are the second a woman appeared in the Battlefield trailer. Most of us immediately cried at the same time, some of us even fell unconscious, one guy loses control and screamed "WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY" very loudly and tried to make the forced joker smile on his mouth using his genuine WW2 Heer Dagger, but thankfully because he didn have control on himself he instead grab his SS themed rubber dildo and when it touched his mouth he began deepthroating it furiously and just the noise he made when he was sucking on it gave me PTSD..

Villain proudly tables Jd9h for the suicide bluff. I replay the hand in my head and realize that Villain has literally zero value combos that can jam river.

Yep I won mention where I read it because there tends to be doxxing when things get too popular but there was a story recently from someone who was really into "witchy stuff" but not proper pagan/wiccan stuff more like "this is my own brand of nonsense created from watching TV and a vague grasp of Silver Ravenwolf Teen Witch books", and in their attempt to either curse someone or to empower herself, she mixed in a goblet around a dozen essential oils and herbs and drank it.

Idea 4: Maybe each line is an anagram. This is my best lead if I assume all my letters thus far are correct, however the punctuation on the German card would not support this action. One nice thing is that it does know words like "Gloomhaven" and "Inox", and it accepts wild cards. However, based on the German card, there's a good chance this is a wild goose chase. I also question how challenging this would be even once the runes translation card is provided. That's why I assume it's at least a safe bet that the entire card is not a giant anagram.
In comparison to the marshmallow spined Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger decided not to support Prop 8 in court.

On websites, "private" usually means in the context of other users. Other websites like dropbox and onedrive say that your stuff are "private".

That being said, there are many ways RMTs have figured out how to incorporate stuff into the practice. I have a friend who does a Thai massage fusion technique and has managed to fit it within the SOP by eliminating all folk terminology/TCM philosophy and creating custom terms combinations such as "dynamic floor mat joint mobilizations, passive stretching and movement coordinated muscle release", etc. I am pretty sure a lot of craniosacral therapists are doing Reiki.

Just because you think women aren't oppressed anymore doesn't make that factual at all. Considering you don't even think they are is part of the problem and denying it is slowing the progression of equality between women and men. 
It not a great spot raise just because you more nutted anyway. $7 is an unusual raise at 1/2, especially from this position, making middle coordinated cards more likely, and villain continuing 2/3p into two players on this sorta board will definitely reduce the amount of AQo type of hands you going to run into.. 
C  Communication Pitfalls: Hearing and listening are two different things. I believe most businesses make customers cranky by not "listening" to what they want. Here is an example.

When she finished doing my hair it was poker straight and she said, "Is that good enough to get you out the door"? Out the door?? Did she hear what I said? Her lack of paying attention will cause me to try another hairstylist the next time! Customers get cranky when you don't pay attention and do your best at satisfying their request.

Then the Russians tried to help boost his campaign, yet he kept quiet. He didn alert the media, didn tell his supporters, and didn go public. 
Ok, one tip; the basis for everything else in poker is math. You need to be able to quickly calculate in your head the likely odds of your hand winning the pot. That's how you know if raising, calling, etc are good bets or bad bets. It's only at that point when reading the other player comes in. If you don't know the odds of your hand being the high hand you have no basis trying to read the other player and deciding if he or she has you beat or not.
It remains in committee. 
So, I pretty new to DMing and D in general. I was raised in an extremely religious family and was forbidden from even thinking about stuff like this. so about a year ago (July last year), a friend approached me and, long story short, I ended up DMing for a group of friends.

It isn as Willis has made clear it is due to the realization that religion, whether it be the community of worshipers or the act of praying or the set of rules and guidelines that the Bible has, doesn always actually help people.
