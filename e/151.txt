"Once a little boy sent me a charming card with a little drawing on it. I loved it. I answer all my children's letters   sometimes very hastily   but this one I lingered over. I sent him a card and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing on it. I wrote, "Dear Jim: I loved your card." Then I got a letter back from his mother and she said, "Jim loved your card so much he ate it." That to me was one of the highest compliments I've ever received. He didn't care that it was an original Maurice Sendak drawing or anything. He saw it, he loved it, he ate it."

And then it gets down to him in the SB and some MAWG in the BB and you can probably already guess what happened. BB asked to chop, the new player looked clueless and called the $3. BB asks again, this time more forcefully. Dealer explains what chopping is to the new player, new player says no let play. BB visually disgusted checks. It checks all the way to the river, SB bets $5, BB folds 93o face up and says "you really want my $3 that bad you can have it". A few other shitregs chime in, more politely albeit, and tell the new player that you are supposed to chop when it gets to the blinds, it just wastes time, only play if you have a bad beat hand, all the typical bullshit, and it all going straight over the new player head. His first pot won in live poker and it will go down in his memory as getting scolded by other players. I speak up to try to make light of the situation, I told the new player that there no rule that says you have to chop, you can play if you want, he just mad that you took his $3. to which MAWG immediately retorts that he doesn care about the $3, that "it the principle".

Yes, it is a reconstruction and the interior is a museum, but the outside and grounds are very impressive despite it being a reconstruction. "Concrete reconstruction" makes it sound like it looks bad, but that is definitely not the case. It was just made without using the traditional materials/techniques for the building structure. The museum is fairly well done, too. It not far from other sites in Osaka so it doesn take up that much time.

I watched her videos. She sounds like an idiot. She shared them to employees, which was super dumb. The idea of criticizing her is fine, the idea of putting a company out of business because the wife of the owner shared her dumb political views is just incredibly stupid to me. Even now when she not sending these things internally and just writing op eds you have publications like the Mercury saying she shooting herself in her foot and harming her husband business by doing it. I find the argument that she created an "unsafe" environment by sharing the videos internally to be horseshit and feel like if that makes you feel unsafe then you need to toughen up a little not treat this crazy lady and her dumb political views as this monster who must be stopped.

Vegas is a pretty cool city to experience overall. The cost of living is lower than other places and the food is great.

It generally keeps you from being a big, bone filled blob.Myers was among the first medical professionals to challenge the field ignorance of fascia in the human body.He has long argued for a more holistic treatment, with a focus on the fascia as an unappreciated overseer.every anatomy lists around 600 separate muscles, it is more accurate to say that there is one muscle poured into six hundred pockets of the fascial webbing.

But because our country is so embedded in the idea that good people are those that discipline their sexual impulses and confine them to marriage, we are unable to actually consider what politicians stand for until we have forced them to prove themselves "good husbands" (and sometimes "good wives"). we can stop believing the Disney fairytale that marriage is the only goal, the one path to a good and happy life, we will continue to elect leaders who are actually sex crazed poodles but stand around waving with their wives tightly by their sides.

McCarthyism and cold war era American chest thumping have absolutely corrupted the average persons view of the ideology. But it has to be pointed out that no one has done more to corrupt it than those who flew their own twisted flags under the guise of red and gold. Communism and socialism at their core are not militaristic and the genocides committed by Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Kim Il Sung, etc have done enough to make an onlooker judge the ideology before learning about it.

Now, this tip is even more powerful than it might appear at first and here why.
It just basically a poll of its citizens on how the citizens of each country, and their view of their government record on corruption. This means that South Koreans are very critical of their government, as opposed to countries like UAE and Qatar whose press whitewash over their problems and abuses by their governments. Even your country Japan does this to another whole degree. Japan has a high perception score consistently year after year, yet we know that somehow the Japanese people delusionally think their government is clean. How to explain this? Lack of press freedom in Japan, and it probably cultural. Koreans are very cynical towards their government and distrust their institutions. Japanese on the other hand, unquestioningly obey and follow their leaders and believe them even if they are caught lying over and over again. Also, Koreans are passionately politically active, as opposed to Japanese who are apathetic towards politics. In Japan, only the old guard still participate in political processes. Whereas in South Korea, the society is very divided because everyone has an opinion, therefore they vibrantly debate the issues. So if you caught buying a $40 lunch for a civil servant is considered a corrupt behavior, while in Japan, it unthinkable that it could be a crime like in Korea.

The basic bluff goes like this: You have nothing. Your opponents may have nothing. You bet. They fold. Sometimes it's difficult even to make people throw away an inside straight (where the missing card is in the middle of the four on the table). They keep hoping. Know your opponents. Everyones chances of hitting a four card open straight is twice as likely, because it has a place open at either end to complete the hand; for example, a hand of 4 5 6 7 can use either a 3 on the left end or an 8 at the other to complete the straight. But, an inside straight only has one space somewhere in the middle that must be filled to complete the hand; 4 6 7 8 needs a 5 and nothing else to become a straight (half as likely).

In Metroid Prime, if you get lost for a long time the game will eventually say "uncle" and your map will tell you where to go next (saying there significant activity in that area). As a wimpy Metroid player who loves the action and puzzles but hates wandering aimlessly, I would love the option to ask the game to tell me where to go. I feel like if Zelda has Navi and Mario has Super Guide Blocks and smart steering, this may be reasonable as long as it not the default setting of the game. Of course, advanced and traditional players can play without it. In fact, I would happily take a penalty or a limit for it if it meant not scouring through a guide to find out I on the wrong side of the map.

Edit: The most difficult parts of grooming them are cleaning their claws and their ears. They tend to get buildup in their ears over time that should be cleaned out. Still, I estimate that it only takes 10 15 minutes to do a full bath + claws + ears.We also keep their nails trimmed more often than we would a normal cat, since they can accidentally scratch themselves (or each other) due to the lack of furry armor.You can also clean them with coconut oil, if a full water bath is undesirable at the moment   plus, it great for their skin!chive_machine  4 points  submitted 2 years agoBathing tends to happen between once a week and once a month   in the dryer months, they seem to get less oil buildup on their skin, so they both need to be bathed less and are more prone to having dry skin issues if bathed too often.Sphynx vary pretty significantly on how much fur they have   there are some cats that have basically none (and their skin can feel kind of tacky to the touch), and there are some cats (particularly recent descendants of outcrosses) that are almost fully furred (although those can be shown).

It unclear exactly how all of this happened. I personally blame Ronald Reagan, as I do for most things. Not only did Reagan start the trend of cutting education from the federal budget, but he also oversaw the deregulation of banking that led to commercial banks taking over student loans. The result of all this is a country where the average college student takes out tens of thousands of dollars in debt and often doesn even manage to get a degree. Worse, being able to take out such huge amounts of money has set universities loose to charge higher and higher prices, without regard to what people can actually afford.

I can explain the resident and her friend inquiry, the lights, nor the nurse experience with the apparition. The nurse and I feel that the resident may have accidentally tapped the TV Button on her bedside call light/switch box, but certainly added to the unnerving experience. The nurse and I documented the experience of the resident but leaving out the abnormalities of the lights, apparition, and other residents because quality of care did not change.

The nurse did request for day shifts for a couple of weeks and then went back to nights. Thanks for reading.

It the qualifying total for regionals (CPU), so it be a motivating goal.When I first started running, I couldn run for more than 3 minutes, but I had a goal of running a sub 30 min 5k.

Dernire contradiction soutenue, le principe d'galit. Le Conseil rappelle que le principe d'galit ne s'oppose pas  ce que le lgislateur propose une diffrence de traitement ds lors que les situations sont diffrentes ou en s'appuyant sur des raisons d'intrt gnral. Une atteinte au principe d'galit implique donc une diffrence de traitement de personnes places dans la mme situation. Or, les couples de mme sexe et les couples de sexe diffrent cre deux situations distinctes, pouvant tre traites selon des rgles diffrentes.

Most importantly, hit your shots. Know the strength of your weapons and what works best for you. Some have a crazy spread, some are on point all the time. try to use all the weapons and see what you like best. a purple p90 can eliminate a 100/100 player in 1 second if they put the muzzle next to your skull. That key too, shoot and move, use cover, and RELOAD after every time you shoot. nothing worse than clicking and having nothing come out. What works well for me is getting right next to them, they take too long too adjust their weapon and you really can miss from that far away.

Unlike the vast majority of politicians/pundits/commentators.Tucker Carlson solution reminds me of what the Romans did. Romans had an abundant slave work force. Instead of innovating technology, which would have cost slave workers their jobs, they just kept on using slaves. That didn work out too well for them did it?. 
Treat your gambling bankroll as an entertainment expense and budget accordingly. 
Another thought would be to hide non dealer hands through some sort of encryption until the hand is completed then publish results to blockchain of players/seats that still remain in the game if more than one player exists at completion. This would save exposure of players who fold yet protect strategy of players that win through elimination of other players (folding).

My kiddo was always really good about trying at least a bite of anything to check if it was good or bad (I did allow "it smells icky" because that valid) and "if you really don like it then okay, fine, Mommy will make a peanut butter and cheese sandwich, you freaking monster." I mean. I didn actually call him that but I thought it. Who eats that? He also puts grape jelly on eggs.

One of those books, a medical text, challenged the (religious) orthodoxy of the brain being the seat of all power and wisdom of the body, stating that it was the heart that pumped the blood and not the head, providing another chink in the armor of theological doctrine.

People buy Bitcoin as an investment and they're right too. Again, I would encourage you to take a closer look at the technology. r/Bitcoin is a great place to start. Bitcoin has the capability to become much more widely adopted than it is now. It's nowhere near the level that Facebook is at in terms of use, but a better example is another payment network like Visa. Visa processes almost 150M transactions per day. Bitcoin processes 300k. Strictly talking valuation, Bitcoin's marketcap is at almost a billion dollars. It seems like a lot, but the value of all gold in the world is at 8.2T, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin's eventual value approach that. Bitcoin is also deflationary   there will only ever be 21M BTC. Of course it won't increase 1000x. But it will increase. Happy to discuss more if you want

The biggest being the hold. Gas stations are major shit heads about this. I seen holds for a dollar, and I seen holds for a hundred dollars. The gas station will essentially ping you bank account to make sure it real and has money before allowing you to pump gas. This is fine and all, except sometimes these holds last for days. It a shitty business practice. So by using a credit card, you tying up the available credit line on your card, not the actual money in your account.
