The prehistory of heavier than air flight is loaded with some fantastic ideas, some just generally fantastical and some prescient, or recognizably prescient from some advanced point in the idea future. There was an immediate and relatively massive published reaction to the Montgolfier brothers first balloon ascension in June 1783, much of which was useful and applicable, some of which was interesting if not practicable, and a little of which was just deeply problematic, not very considered, and all around wrong overall, it was interesting thinking, thinking about this brand new issue, people trying to get their heads around new concepts and answering them with new  and not so new thinking..

2) Theoretically, it should be possible to run the build scripts and ensure the output is the same as the published built files. This provides some safeguarding against code injection attacks. Without both the source and the build information (hopefully the build tools are specified as dev dependencies), this isn possible. Similarly to point 1, it is also much easier to look for security vulnerabilities (intentional or otherwise) in source code than minified.

Are now on the submit page. Due to zoning regulations, and property costs, these businesses are pretty much lumped together. Salt Lake City zoning only allows massage parlors that are NOT connected to a medical use to be placed within a specific area called a commercial corrdior. In SLC proper, those areas are restricted to between main street and state street, between 900 south and 2100 south.

There are one or two blocks farther east that are grandfathered I believe.

Thanks. We grew up in the same house. Our moms were identical twins and we always joke about being sisters. Our moms both passed away from lung cancer and drinking was her way of coping. She was 7 years older than me but she always let me tag along with her highschool friends and college buddies and everyone was always so kind and nice. She always got me out of the house to do things and it was all that exposure that broke me out of my own shell having been so traumatized by my mother passing when I was 13.

My father grew up in the heart of Hyderabad, in as idyllic a childhood as I've ever had described to me.

My hope would be that by preparing yourself, the anxiety when you actually encounter a situation in real life would be less.

Recent data suggest that the slowdown in the global economy has been more pronounced and widespread than the Bank had forecast in its January Monetary Policy Report(MPR). While the sources of moderation appear to be multiple, trade tensions and uncertainty are weighing heavily on confidence and economic activity. It is difficult to disentangle these confidence effects from other adverse factors, but it is clear that global economic prospects would be buoyed by the resolution of trade conflicts.

When it comes to Elder Scrolls or Fallout they can more likely get away with a shorter marketing campaign. Keep in mind that is still new even for BGS. They just kind of have two examples of how it plays out with a BGS title. Those examples are Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. With Fallout 4, they didn need to really turn up the hype over time and everyone was already very familiar with a BGS Fallout game. That short release window was perfect for them and they had a lot of good will and trust from gamers at the time. There were even a lot of people who had no problems with BGS first introducing a DLC Pass and pre saling it. Everyone figured it would be more than worth it in the end and the pass was only 30 bucks at first before they raised it after giving everyone about a month notice. With Fallout 76, the short release widow didn work out so well for BGS. Those I suppose people could argue it did based on the fact more people were "tricked" into buying it due to hype.

If the "elites" really had such a plan, it a little late now to put it into action in my opinion.

What it really looks like, geographically speaking, is very specific to dungeness crab cooking. I not sure if it from a molt, or if it from a crab boil or bake, but when you separate the top shell, there is that layer of kind of custardy stuff between the shell and the lungs. It doesn often come out in one piece, but when it does, it looks like that, with that color. The point on the upper left part of it matches the shape of the top shell of a dungeness, and if it measures about as wide as an outstretched hand, 7 8 inches, that might be it. Someone on that beach is probably really good at cooking crab.

Oh, I get what you are saying, but I think Reddit has grown enough to encompass a LARGE demographic of people. Just by cruising other forums of the site, you can see people commenting from ages 12 70, from all over the world, male/female/trans whathaveyou, different religions, political beliefs, etc. Perhaps Reddit was once a hive of socially maladjusted folks who gathered to swap sick stories, but I feel that Reddit includes not just the weirdos who need to vent but the married men, people with children, etc. I don know if my own personal friends would joke about humiliating and raping women just because they could without consequence, and I don think the majority of people on here would condone that (as seen on AskReddit sections on male/female rape); no one would go on there, bragging about the celebrity they would grope if time were frozen. I was just disappointed with the amount of people who came on this particular forum and got upvoted for their dream assaults. I wanted to refrain from a rant on here since people will guffaw and say there is no crime in speaking their mind, and time freezing would not happen anyways.

Part of the answer depends on your age: the older you are, the more you may want in stable funds such as bonds. If you younger, you may want riskier but higher returns. Greater Fool suggests using the formula of (90   your age in years = % portfolio in stocks.) So a 20 year old could have 70% in stocks but a 50 year old would have 40%. Personally, I find that a bit too conservative as most index funds automatically rebalance to achieve good returns with strong performing individual funds.

Max has not tracked the funds closely enough to determine if he is getting good performance for the amount he pays. The annual tab is a few thousand dollars that could go to something more useful if he swapped the balances into low fee ETFs.

The feudal centrifuge of Pakistani politics, the PPP, has shed blood in service of democracy, but its record is far from pristine. It has been enabled by and has been an enabler of the military's power plays throughout history. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto rose to prominence as a trusted stud of Field Marshall Ayub Khan. So while his heroism for standing up to Zia's deception and having the courage to live and die by the sword can never be questioned, his political genesis has an unquestionable khaki shade. More recently, while Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto perpetuated the Bhutto family's legacy of making the ultimate sacrifices for their politics, her return to Pakistan was negotiated with Pakistan's military. May God rest her soul in peace, but she too left a khaki tint on the proud red, black and white flag of the PPP's now largely feudal colours.Within this political culture   a culture in which other people's money is a fundamental and existential element of strategy, tactics and operations   the Pakistani elite have been operating in synchronicity with their attendant political conditions.The military elite, personified by the Corps Commanders meeting at the General Head Quarters (GHQ) on Wednesday, struck first and struck hard, playing to public sentiment and "standing up" for Pakistan.

Might as well make it detailed!So I been really sick for the last week with fever, headache, etc. I spent most of the weekend in bed. I had meetings at the UN though on Monday and even though I went I was absolutely fucked. Couldn move my neck and everything hurt. So during the meeting I was trying to find a non erotic Thai massage, since that always made me feel better back in Japan. I chose Tawan since the yelp reviews were good and it wasn on Istedgade. They charge 400dkk for 1 hour and even have an offer where after 5 visits you get 1 hour Thai massage for free! (make sure you ask for the stamp card).I went in around 6.15PM and was let right into a very clean and nice room. The masseuse (Phan) spoke some English (I used a combo English/Swedish to communicate). So I undressed and laid down and she put on some relaxing music. I asked for a lot of pressure and she definitely delivered! She easily found all my knots and really helped fix my neck so that I could move again. She was damn strong and it was definitely the deepest massage I ever had (inc. Turkish style). She also scrubbed my body with a hot cloth and did some Thai stretching exercises. At the end she gave me some cold water and I checked my watch (1:10 later!). I really felt great at the end there and will definitely be going back.Full disclosure though, she did gently offer a happy ending near the end of the massage. I kindly said no thanks and that was the end of it. But anyway, the massage was fantastic and I saw her change all the sheets and towels when I left the room.
