The Theon Cross album is hands down my AOTY so far. He plays tuba in Sons of Kemet, so if you listened to them that will give you an idea of what his playing sounds like. The album almost feels like jazz musicians making electronic music, the tuba has a great low end, the drums played by Moses Boyd are straight in the pocket and he uses a lot of four on the floor type beats, and the sax playing by Nubiya Garcia creates some nice melodic lines on top. Highly recommend the album
I see PBE as mostly for bugtesting. There just way too many scenarios in League that the best way to test for bugs is to throw new champions into games and see where mistakes crop up, then patch those mistakes. A few years ago, one major one made it onto live servers that I personally recalled: some Lulu skins polymorphing some champions just caused a full game bugsplat. These are very rare and far in between, and IMO this is what PBE hopes to catch and patch.

This might be common sense, but a lot of being adaptable and ever growing has a lot to do with the internal relationship with ourselves, especially when it comes to emotional intelligence. Perhaps a way to deepen the RPWs topics is to think more about how to properly grow and strengthens ourselves from the inside. Things like developing emotional intelligence, learning to see through our own bs by developing integrity, and stabilizing core values of being loving to the world by first being loving towards ourselves.

We are debating semantics. Token people came from everywhere   technically correct, but also deeply misleading. Until WW2, again, the cruishing majority was european. Taking away the africans, that hardly "immigrated", we are talking about 99.9% europeans. So, saying that "many people from all over went to america   but yeah, europeans were a majority" is misleading. For all they were worth statistically, no one from the whole world went to americas and US in particular until very recently, and the englishmen   europeans were not a majority, they were the population. I don have ready available datas on where from europe future americans come exactly, but i distinctly remember how there was a period between 1800/1900 where there have been waves of disctin nationalities (irish, italian, germans etc) that followed the original english core.

In Italy our house was bereft of amenities, mom walked to the communal water fountain where she would fill a large cistern to carry back. Laundry was done in the creek, heat was from a fireplace that also served as the cooking area for making meals. The house, which was mom's dowry when she married dad, consisted of two rooms lit by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. It also had an area where sausages could be seen hanging along with cured hams and a suspended shelf covered with loaves of bread. Every now and then a chicken would get into the house and at night I'd hear it squawking trying to get out. What I loved most though was the fish market, where shelves and containers of shiny fish would sparkle in the sunlight, black eels moved around in metal pails and snails tried to crawl out of the basins holding them.

The prevalence of these programs is no surprise considering that 80 percent of the Indian population uses Ayurvedic remedies, either exclusively or in conjunction with Western treatments [source: NCCAM].

This may even include a deck of cards that match the theme associated with the event. Consider a situation where you routinely have a special poker game on the Fourth of July.

Eventually no limit poker is going to be solved or near solved by computers (heads up limit is already solved). This will hurt online a lot unless poker sites can get an iron clad way to detect bots.

After my fianc Ray's sudden death in 2010, I was destroyed. I ended up spending over a month in a county jail for old court fees associated with a bounced grocery store check. I started grad school four months after his funeral. I showed up late to classes, slept through lectures and spent my nights playing cash poker games at a local bar aptly named "Bum's Billiards." I moved into a $200 room in a house that I soon learned had rats in the vents. The life I had planned with him   a teaching job in Dallas, buying our first house together, making a family   was gone.

Furthermore, and humorously, you don even realize that I used your own flawed logic against you; when you insisted in an earlier reply that "it doesn make sense" for a "lawful character" or a "thief who doesn get caught" to be in prison, I couldn believe you were unable to think of why. Even I can think of easy justifications: Innocent law abiding people are thrown in jail all the time just because they likely suspects, or because the law officers are corrupt. The thief who "doesn get caught" logically must been caught before, so he/she must have the experience required to know how not to get caught. 
So, we do use "whilst" though not very frequently. If someone asked us to be more formal or in "proper" British English, such words would definitely be used more.

For the most part I been assuming you looking at DoD related jobs in this area that require a security clearance (mostly likely collateral Secret, but possibly more restrictive.) The ability to hold a clearance is worth something, and holding an active clearance is worth a premium. If you are, for whatever reason, unable to hold a clearance, there are still other software engineering roles in the area, but they may not pay quite as much. Some roles at ADTRAN et al pay similarly to what I described above because they compete with cleared contractor roles for talent; others are not.

The game is a turn based strategy based off of their original game, Runescape (which is great itself). The reason why this game is so good is it has a very appealing range of combat strategy and most of the time players start on a level ground. The best part is that the strategy can get intense very quickly and planning your next moves becomes extremely exciting, turn after turn! If you go try it out, make sure to complete the tutorial before heading into the multiplayer lobby, it's really worth the learning experience and prevents headaches early on in versus play. I give it 9.6 out of 10!
She probably already is (or will soon) permanently moved in with him, and eventually he announce that him and his ex are back together, engaged, pregnant again with a second child, and etc. and Op will still be waiting around for him to "come back".

Colonoscopy. People make jokes about it and it sounds crazy and uncomfortable to have a tube with a camera going several feet up your ass but the reality is that you get great IV drugs that knock you out and you wake up half an hour later or so and never experienced any of the actual procedure. The only part about the procedure that is unpleasant is not being allowed to eat the day before and having to take medicine (drink) the day before that makes you shit your brains out until you literally pooping out water, which is a bizarre experience. And the whole thing could save your life when they find cancer growing silently in your intestines.

Just because its on HBO doesn mean the film is generating a ton of revenue, it just means the film has been bought by HBO for distribution. Details about the budget aren online but I am sure HBO paid enough for the film so that everyone who worked on set and in post could get paid a fixed wage, assume it a union average rate. A lot of that purchase probably covered production losses (renting equipment, studio shoot, any travel reimbursement, licenses for archival footage and music etc.) In doc work some of that money could go to the subjects but it is rarely substantial and it sounds like both of the docs subjects have opted out so thats not the case here.

First off, this game sounds incredible! $1/3 with $8 10k on the table? Put me on the wait list! Anyway, I really like your sizing to $265. You right, if you go to $150 this will end up massively multi way and you don want that. Things get dicey on the flop. I understand you want to bet, but what worse hand is calling? You and the board block all the nut flush draws that would have called your 3bet pre. So it only value out there? Just 4 combos of AK, maybe 3 combos of KQs, and maybe you get one street out of QQ and JJ. That pretty slim. Sizing is fine, you already used the large sizing preflop to iso, no need to bloat it further.

Edit: An implication of all of this is that as time goes by (assuming packs are used as entry fees and that people like playing for stakes) cards will become dirt cheap. As players will keep opening packs to get into tournaments after having already completed their collection. The extra cards will then be sold on the market, increasing the supply.

"Really, really evil"? Until someone can give me a clear metric for evil, I'm going to stick with the numbers as the best perspective. Seven million murdered is worse than six million murdered, and given the choice between the two I would choose six million to be murdered. Human squeamishness is what makes us uncomfortable with this decision. That and being saturated in Hollywood simplified ethics, such that we feel there's something dishonorable about choosing the lesser of two evils.

What do you want them to do, continue losing $2 million every four years to house 100 residents in an area with probably the highest cost of living in the entire city?

No. Texas Hold'Em is by far the most popular poker variation to day. Texas Hold'Em is played by following rules. You receive 2 "Hole cards". After the 2 hole cards are dealt there is a round of betting. Then the flop is being dealt. The flop consists out of 3 cards face up. After the round of betting the "turn" is put on the table. The turn is 1 face up card next to the flop. Another round of betting happens. Then the "River" is dealt. This is another face up community card. A final round of betting happens after the river. After the round of betting finishes on the river the player who has bet first must show his cards to see who has won the pot. In 5 card draw you receive 5 hole cards and depending on the variation of 5 card draw there is 1 or 3 or more rounds of betting where players can choose to trade cards from the deck(s) of cards. Each trade of the cards is followed by a round of betting. (Full Answer)

I tip more than average because I worked in the Industry and have friends and family who still do. That being said $1 a pot is acceptable, big pots you may wanna throw up to $5 to the dealer and huge pots use your discretion. But these people saying they only tip every few pots or if they are up for the session or they tip when the dealer changes if they made money while the dealer was there are mostly likely nits, scum bags or pretensions douches.

Wading through transcripts of the hours of Lane videotaped interviews with police, I linger over the sections where she talks about the man she claims is the father of her second child, Tegan. She describes Andrew Norris as fair haired, tanned, well built and of medium height.

Since these cards are so durable you won't need to constantly replace them as they will last far longer than do the normal type of cards. This is wonderful for people who are avid cards players as they often spend a fortune in cards over a years time. 100 plastic playing cards can actually last for years without needing to be replaced..

This is not to say that Auto Chess has no "bad" RNG. Item drops are a total crapshoot. Not only might you not get any drops at all, but when you do get drops they might be extremely low impact items. All while your opponents could be rolling in good and plentiful items. But in alignment with my greater point here, this is often complained about as the biggest flaw of Auto Chess.

As I got older I was introduced to more drag culture through movies and television (one of the ways I knew my husband was "the one" was when I popped our VHS copy of Priscilla while we were still in high school and he wasn like "oh this is weird.") I have a two year old now and we take her to the children festitivites during pride (they do drag queen story time, "love bubbles" where they have someone come in and blow huge bubbles, that sort of thing) but I don watch Drag Race or queens youtube channels around her because it not really appropriate content for children. I think there also something to be said for people who take their children to drag events but don really do much to support LBGTQIA individuals. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth because they taking from a community for their personal entertainment/gain but not actually doing much to support that community itself buuut that a different soapbox entirely.. 
No it doesn Because if an offense is centered around running the ball, then that offense is operating suboptimally. We know, unequivocally, that passing is more efficient than running. When building a team, running back is the last piece of the puzzle. The Ravens have more holes to fill at far more important positions, mainly WR, that need to be addressed before running back.
I don think they stop loving unless something happens that damages your relationship with them.

"Data from the airplane's flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the airplane's right elevator was positioned full trailing edge down (TED) when the flight crew first powered up the airplane on the day of the accident and remained there throughout the accident sequence. An airplane performance study (based, in part, on FDR data) confirmed that the airplane did not respond in pitch when the captain pulled on the control column. Based on the study's comparison with a previous takeoff, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the airplane's lack of rotational response to the control column input did not become apparent to the captain in time for him to have stopped the airplane on the runway..

Edit: while maybe private companies can fund research saying there no downsides, there is an incredible amount of research independently showing the upsides, and that why we vaccinate. Maybe there are problems, honestly nobody has shown either way on that, even the new Denmark study said that although there was a slight apparent correlation (90% confidence interval > not enough at all for a conclusion to be drawn) between not vaccinating and autism that the sample size wasn big enough for this to be considered significant, and this is one of the biggest studies done.

TL;DR: where the hell do i put my feet when conventional deadlifting?OP was asking about how Coan did so well compared to taller lifters. The question was phrased in a way that seemed to be asking "why someone who is short is stronger than someone who is taller?" Statistically, short limbed lifters have done better with individual lifts. No one is arguing that being a manlet is the ONLY reason for Coan success, but that is why he does better than tall lifters in his weight class..

"Unfortunately, the prevalence of ESA vest and registry scams . desensitizes the public from understanding the impact and importance of ESAs to individuals who truly need them for therapeutic purposes," says attorney Erin Jackson, who has written about the hostility she encountered from airline employees and passengers when she traveled with her ESA. "Instead of viewing the animal as a therapy tool, fellow travelers may resent other passengers who are allowed to bring their 'pet' on the plane. However, note that because ESAs don't wear identification, other travelers may not be able to distinguish between a pet and an ESA."

A) My making of an Atheist post does not necessarily bring with it a contempt for Christianity or any other religion, for that matter.

After all betting is completed, a fourth card is dealt face up to each player who has not folded. From this point on, the player with the highest hand showing starts the action. For example, if the high hand (excluding the hole cards) is a pair after the fourth card is dealt, the player with this pair must check (to decline to bet or to pass when it is your turn to act), bet, or fold. Because there is no bring in requirement after the first betting round, players do not need to fold until there is a bet. Once there is a bet, players left in the game, in turn, must call, raise, or fold. It is possible for players to check around the table, thus having a round with no bets.
