Do you think that a lot of women wouldn do the same for a life changing event like a pregnancy? Banning abortion won stop abortion, it only force the women who want one to do it dangerously in an unsafe way. If Republicans actually cared about the life of children, why don they support programs to help children after they born? Why don they support comprehensive sex education in schools and easy access to contraception, things that would dramatically decrease the amount of unwanted pregnancies?.

The original version of craps contained a flaw where people could actually win. The sarcastically named John Winn introduced a new rule that fixed the hell out of that.

If you can't raise with it then fold. Play position. Be aggressive. Erratic play can pay off. Don't be afraid to look back at your cards. Look at your cards sometimes even when you know what you have. Always protect your hand (put a chip on your hole cards). If the guy to your left is aggressive go ahead and check good hands (he'll raise them for you and no one will know what kind of hand you have) and don't pay to see the flop (you'll end up folding once it's raised). If the guy to your right is aggressive go ahead and raise regardless of what you have at least once (otherwise he'll roll over you all night). Never show your hand if you win.

Many people ask how hard it actually is. The simplest analogy is "think of the hardest thing you could ever do   then double it".Being camouflaged isn't sexyWhile the stereotypical film shot sees the hero blend seamlessly into the background, it doesn't show the discomfort of sweating like a cheap beef salad while lying awkwardly in spiky gorse bushes, with twigs, leaves and broken branches scraping and scoring your skin, leaving you feeling like you have been mistreated by a sexually frustrated Laburnum.You become bilingualRoyal Marines talk "Jackspeak"   a Naval lingo where toilets are "heads", and steak and kidney puddings "babies heads".

But here the other lesson that I learned . Cannot give up. 
Due to the vagaries of tournament poker, in a typical field even the very best players are only about three to four times as likely to win as the average player. In other words, in any given tournament with 400 entrants, the top player in the field would be no better than a 100 1 shot to win it.

What if the revered UN were to produce overwhelming evidence that it was definitely Assad who used the chemical weapons? Would Mr Putin then accept that Syria is no longer in a legal position to make any demands at all in return for putting those weapons out of its own reach? Somehow I doubt it. But there was a more insidious charge contained in Mr Putin sermon on respect for the law as laid down by the UN Security Council (which is to say by him, since he has a controlling veto). It was the taunt that world increasingly see[s] America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force And he went on, must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilised diplomatic and political settlement. 
R3: If a player like Ivey or Holz had this ability, it's basically game over for everyone else. Even accounting for variance. They will better adjust to the pitfall of "supposed" to lose to not arouse suspicion. They will simply lose the minimum amount. Some of these guys are math geniuses who studied the statistics of the game on a high level for many years. They also understand player archetypes. The top poker guys study each other's games. They play with each other in tournies like these. They have a hand history with each other. They understand each others tendencies. With full information, they could better induce bluffing or betting and know the perfectly correct amounts to bet. I would say 7/10. 15 points  submitted 2 months ago

This issue will literally never be fixed. I haven seen a single game that has fixed it. Any time they start skewing more to an even matching, games take forever to find and the players tart complaining. As soon as they start prioritizing speed, they complain about width in skill gap. These guys are just so much better than anyone else that they only actually have about 300 400 people that they can even match with and get a decent game and those people would all have to be on at the same time for good decent times. If they want good matches, play an inhouse league. CS pros don do matchmaking for a reason.

In blackjack, the usual method for tipping is to place an additional bet at the front of your betting box. Don't tip so much or so frequently that you significantly shift the odds of the game. If you're betting $5 for yourself, a $1 bet for the dealer once or twice an hour, or when you're on a winning streak, will do. If you win the hand, the dealer will get a $2 tip. If you lose, the house gets the money.

Once a guy grabbed his stack of chips ($5s on the bottom, some $25s on top) and stretched it out and tried to count out a call. He did take his hands off the stack to cut it at a call (I think it was around a $20 call, so he picked it up again after the 4th chip). Guy that originally bet had a big hand and wanted to floor to check the tape to see if his hand did come off, thus putting all the chips in play. Caller swore he didn but the tape shows he let them go. He was told that kind of play is legal to call (grabbing a stack and counting them in front), but any that touch the felt or are on the table when the hand is removed stay. I think this is actually terrible practice. It can definitely be exploited, and I every once in awhile do see it exploited. So if villain announces call as hero is cutting his chips, hero can immediately pull back any chips that havent touched the table yet if he is bluffing, or if he has major value he can bet as many chips as he brought out. This should not be able to happen. It is a really easy rule to enforce to (any chips crossing the line must remain in pot), unfortunately soooo many people do it near me, that changing this rule would cause a ton of issues.

"Aural memory" alone makes any subjective comparison more or less invalid, and the longer it went between the listens the less valid it is. Obviously one can decide if it sounds good or not when you listening, but trying to comparatively quantify that to something you heard days or weeks earlier is total bullshit. Humans are irrational creatures at best with extremely foggy abilities to remember anything objectively   our preferences and opinions and preconceived notions are vastly more likely to just have done a real number on whatever memory we have..

At which point Nomad is pretty much strictly better. If the non rolling card is a Null, your attack will deal zero damage, but any rolling modifier status effects (stun etc) are still applied. When disadvantaged, you draw 2 cards, if one is a rolling modifier and the other non rolling, you disregard the rolling modifier and the non rolling card is your draw (this means that a rolling +1 and a 2X will result in you taking the 2X). Naturally, if you don have rolling modifiers, you simply draw 2 cards and choose the better or worse one, respectively.
Aguirre sees his age and background as an advantage in understanding different points of view, calling himself a "little bit of a Rosetta Stone." He says he wants to leave a legacy of bringing diverse talent into the industry. 
Which ever one you get, if it has a dial gauge and a mushroom looking weight regulator, get a three piece weight regulator to replace the mushroom looking one. Dial regulators have to be re calibrated every year (and sometimes out of the box), and you need to stay within sight of the canner to make sure it doesn drop below pressure.

Bad Wiessee has very high rakes and limits. Good poker is in Kufstein, as there are free poker rooms with reasonable limits/rakes for beginners (sometimes as low as .50/1 iirc. Also Czech has some Casinos near the border.Shamrock used to be the nicest/fairest legal public game in munich imho, but only once a week and I don know if it still going. Most of the others (if still operational) like Bavarian Poker Tour, 9 2 poker etc have a very steep blind structure in their SNGs so it mainly about constant all in pushing. But those events are good for making contact with regular players and finding less legal opportunities with more serious poker. (1/2 or 2/5 in blinds, no stack limits 5 rake back when I used to know those). As you can tell my experience there is a bit outdated, so might not be like this any more.

Even when I reached out to her on facebook, I didn learn that the pieces she used on her page ended up being either mostly stuff she had made when she was much younger, or photos of work by friends done in her studio with no credit attached. She had a very convincing image online, and because I had family who lived a couple hours away in the same state, I felt okay taking the gamble if things went south..

The central conceit of this series is sort of the opposite of old school geocentrism; each intelligent species, of which there are many, gets its own (similar) path with God and opportunity to fall, but most don F it up like humans did.

Should I try to be opening more pre flop? I know in normal poker you should rarely limp in but 1/2 NL seems to be a somewhat different game. Most people will chase everything and since you only have 100 blinds to start with, going for big bets pre and post flop increases the variance on the session. For example if I make a 15 dollar bet pre flop with QJ (hardly does anything if you raise for less) and then c bet on the flop missing the board, say a 20 25 dollar bet, then you are almost 1/4 of the max buy in down on your stack and if you don go with the hand you just lose a huge part of your stack. Seems like its better to just be patient and play small ball poker until you hit and then hope someone has a worse holding than you. I know this isn a good strategy but it seems like the right thing to do.

Once Shawn got hurt he was able to "steal" one of the the top spots. And even when he returned, he brutalized him in the street fight as a last ditch effort to prevent HBK from regaining his popularity. As he got older, he aligned himself with young guns like Batista and Randy to ensure he had a crew of talented young guys to protect his "throne" so to speak. If one got too popular or successful (Randy winning the title at Summerslam) he turned on them instantly.

These are only a few of the indicators of the key emotions any human being feels. Some might even overlap.

Every casino is a giant Skinner Box that records and analyzes the behavior of patrons. That's how we've learned to only use smaller denomination chips during payouts. So if you win, say, a thousand bucks, instead of giving you one $1,000 chip, we'll give you 10 $100 chips, because the human brain doesn't really understand the value of objects. All it really understands is quantity, and to it, 10 $100 chips is more than one $1,000 chip.

Vulnerable people get sucked in too, loneliness can eat away at people so much that I think they would sometimes rather just live with the lies because in this fantasy they have build is comfort, in this fantasy they are safe.

So why does anyone get into it in the first place? Speaking only for myself, it started off as curiosity since I kept hearing about how good the show was suppose to be. But I think a lot of it also came from it feeling like a forbidden fruit to me, in a sense. It a show clearly aimed at little girls, and here I was, a man in his mid twenties at the time, enjoying it.

The reason this is such an advantage is that the button gets to see what everyone else does before he/she has to act. This leads to opportunities to steal a pot with a marginal hand and allows good players to win the maximum amount with their good hand. It also allows the good players to minimize their losses in certain situations.. 
After this I turned it off, and a couple of weeks later I returned to it, and that when I completely fell for the entire album. And that really how I fell for TMV and Prog in general.

I (F, 22 at the time) was traveling through Italy alone. At the end of my trip I was staying at a hostel in Rome and decided to make a day trip to Naples and Pompei. When I told the hostel employees my plan they all freaked out and said I shouldn't go alone. Feeling confident, I shrugged off their worries and decided to make the trip anyway. Took the wrong train from Naples, realized my mistake and got off at some random stop in the outskirts of Naples, figuring there would be another train going back soon. Shortly after, local dudes started showing up on the opposite side of the tracks gesturing at me, muttering to each other. One dude even hopped down across the tracks and started pacing on my platform. I had a pocket knife in my coat that I was white knuckling the whole time. It felt like forever before the next train showed up. Thankfully nothing happened but I was basically in panic mode and couldn't wait to get the F out of Naples.

It just cosmetic. I just want to set the record straight, that even religion not included, there are health benefits and negligible risks (which are greatly outweighed by the benefits as pointed out by our non secular CDC) for getting the procedure done.

"Aural memory" alone makes any subjective comparison more or less invalid, and the longer it went between the listens the less valid it is. Obviously one can decide if it sounds good or not when you listening, but trying to comparatively quantify that to something you heard days or weeks earlier is total bullshit. Humans are irrational creatures at best with extremely foggy abilities to remember anything objectively   our preferences and opinions and preconceived notions are vastly more likely to just have done a real number on whatever memory we have..

The check airman, who was the pilot monitoring (and was providing airplane differences training to the captain), questioned the captain's decision to reject the takeoff after V1 but adhered to company standard operating procedures and did not attempt to intervene.

At last, Rodgers appeared and we were off on an escapade straight out of Hunter Thompson. For the next three days, he drove fast and talked faster, tearing around Southern California in his sports car with me as a nervous passenger.

Throughout our country's history we didn't have this massive defense budget but instead would dramatically increase spending during war times and return to more normal spending levels during peace time. However, since WW2 we haven't returned to normal military spending levels and have exponentially increased spending in that area which is one of the primary reasons our national debt is so high. Also to sustain/justify this level of military spending (which generates enormous wealth for those in the defense industry) the US has had to actively seek out foreign conflicts and wars to engage in.

For the outside gates of the city they are within are surrounded by an army horde, outnumbering their own.

When it was discovered there lies horrors within, they abandoned that idea and sealed it off. The third iteration, being a thieves guild within the ruins of the mine prospect of the crevasse. They, of course, were wiped out by the inhabitants deep under. SO, with all that being said, a lot of your ideas are extremely fitting, and very possible. Sorry for the info dump.

I had my SKX007 for about two years and wear it often. It started running about  30s slow and became difficult to move the stem due to dried out seals. He said it could be serviced and regulated but for not much more, he could swap in a 4R36 movement. It would require some custom work to the stem and some changes to the date wheel. I had always wished my SKX could hack and hand wind so I was all for the movement swap rather than servicing the 7S26. I left my watch with him for a few weeks and just picked it up a few days ago. The hand winding feels perfect and the watch is keeping great time. He also took care of the seals that were dry and causing too much friction on the stem. I always loved the looks of the SKX and never felt like the aesthetic mods were anything I wanted. This movement swap, however has rekindled my love for the SKX007!
