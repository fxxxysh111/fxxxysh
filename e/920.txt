Obviously this is just an estimate and doesn account at all for the inevitable increase in demand for soybean milk (now that we eliminated livestock), soybean oil, nor other soybean industry production needs. This is purely a discussion on the protein needs the planet would have if it depended on soy instead of meat and, as stated before, even more plant based protein would have to be consumed to make sure the population gets all 9 amino acids (a complete protein diet). Yet this estimate still gives one an idea of how much industrial agriculture would need to increase to accommodate just the protein needs of the planet. Soy is the richest source of plant protein popularly consumed by humans, so other plant based protein sources would have to increase even that much more in a vegan utopia.

Two aces two eights, called a dead man's hand. This term is also used for a hand that is very good, but not a winner (so you are definitely going to lose money on it). Example: You are holding AA in Holdem, and the flop brings AKK. Now if your opponent is holding KK, which gives him four of a kind, you are holding a deadman's hand, since you are very likely to put lots of money in the pot, or even go allin, with a losing hand. In this case the "5 of a kind" is the highest possible hand but will rarely be found in live poker games. Wild card poker can be found more in Video Poker games. (Full Answer)

The Oseberg ship has is a 15 "room" ship, meaning it has 15 pairs of oars, or "rooms" for 15 pairs of rowers (30 men in all). The Norse and early English ships seem to be divided that way into "rooms," from what we know from record keeping; Alfred the Great seems to have ordered several ships of 20 rooms and there were some that were larger.

I been in a similar situation with a friend who was on friendly terms with his ex (her and her new boyfriend were even invited to the wedding). The groom got wasted and got all emotional and started confessing shit to me when I was driving him home. I listened, kept my mouth shut with respect to giving him advice or offering my opinion. I called his ex that night and told her not to go to the wedding (didin give her any explanation even though she asked). The wedding happened a few days later and the marriage lasted a month. The outcome was inevitable but I just didn want an explosion at the ceremony because there would be a lot of collateral damage and some innocent people (his ex for example) would be blamed.

As for the girlfriend getting in, there were two entrances, one was the doors blocked by the tree, the other was the elevator that presumably leads to/from the main house upstairs. The part that seems odd is where was she just before getting the ax? If she came down in the elevator, then the guys run to the elevator, wouldn they have passed her? Maybe she went all the way to the morgue part when they were in the office, then they ran to the elevator and she turned around and came back from the morgue part. Either way, a little convoluted.

This is a very fast way and very good excuse for stripping naked, not to mention this will give you great motivation in playing poker.

"The conversations are always in notes. Sometimes they're in a different country. You'd write your bug and they'd send it back as 'Won't fix.' So then you'd have to talk to your lead.

I learned the game during the Chris Moneymaker boom, and like many back then thought there was little skill involved. I started playing a little in college in 2010 and saw that there was more to it and kind of figured out how to calculate pot odds without fully understanding what I was doing. Then I started playing online poker in 2015 and took it more seriously. I lost a few hundred dollars and got annoyed so I started watching twitch streams to learn more. I picked up some things but I was only breaking even. I joined upswing in 2017 because I really enjoyed Doug take on the game. A few of the core principles I learned really opened up my eyes and allowed me to start winning, but it took time to implement them correctly for MTTs, especially low stake ones. Upswing is too in depth for low stake play most of the time. When players think sec0nd pair low kicker is worth shoving 25 big blinds it hard to bluff as frequently as they say you should. So I had to learn when to bluff against these players and what not.

As for why only European names and not Asians or Indians   well there could be a number of reasons. All of non European remote cousins that appeared on FTDNA were European like yours, but when I switched to Gedmatch I started seeing all sorts from across the world that were far more likely to be false positives. I think the way FTDNA presents who is and who isn your cousin match is much stricter than on Gedmatch, and much likelier to be a real relative.

Until the press stops publishing what it is spoon fed by the army and the government and starts asking questions, we are forced   not unlike Soviet citizens during their Afghanistan war   to read everything as propaganda. It reminds me of an early protest against the Communist Party that I was at in Moscow in 1989. Someone had taken the banner from the largest daily newspaper, Pravda, which means "truth," and written the word "lie." We Americans are now forced to do the same   to translate claims to truth and news into the lies that they are. "More troops or we lose the war" can only be translated as "military generals wish to justify the continued waste of money on useless war." And the "free press" can only be read as "all the news that corporate and military industrial interests deem fit to print."

They get into this in the documentary but the original anti cancer activists were environmentalists and anti capitalists who demanded that research be done on how industrial production and products were contributing to cancer and how this history and legacy has been essentially erased in favor of feel good "fuck cancer!" rhetoric that stages it as a "battle" with "survivors" instead of a massive public health issue that condemns most corporations..

With real wages stagnant for decades and the steady disappearance of traditional middle class jobs in manufacturing, governors and mayors are scrambling for a big win. This fuels the competition for high profile new factories, headquarters and operations centers.

This is because expected payoffs are ALWAYS different and it will never be proper to utilise pure randomisation. A good example of this is in tennis serves, where the direction of shot has to be randomly distributed in order to skew the expected payoff of returning. Djokovic does this very well. One shot games where there is prior information of estimation leads to more randomisation as the opponent will know you know their tendencies and therefore will throw something different. Although this always falls flat in the long run as randomisation will become the norm. A good example of this is Fnatic who used to utilise their plays around the baron always catching the opponent off guard. But as we saw Misfits dismantle that tactic by recognising the permanent threat and predictability. Anyway this is a good discussion and thank you for explaining the relation to poker and chess (who use randomisation and strategic risk taking to beat even super computer level calculation).
It a mockery of the idea of evidence based medicine that researchers could do everything they possibly can to bias the outcome of a psychological trial and still being touted as clinical evidence. If people don take seriously the process that leads to claims of evidence then the whole concept of evidence based medicine is flawed beyond repair.

To me, the contents of the lyrics doesn really matter. I treat vocals as just as another instrument. Sometimes I can understand what these instruments are saying, which is kinda nice for singing along. What has a bigger impact for me though is how the language sounds and the singers voice. It what draws me in Japanese music. one of the most unexpectedly diverse scenes I ever gotten into. Everything from traditional metal like X Japan to power metal like Versailles, death metal like Dir En Grey and gazette to goth rock/Smith like jangly alt rock from L Arc En Ciel, Buck Tick and Luna Sea, synthpop and dark wave from Malice Mizer and Pop Punk from One OK Rock and An Cafe. I enjoy hearing music sung in different languages, and I have made an effort on my last few trips to pick up a few albums from the countries I have visited. It interesting to hear the different styles and sounds from other countries, and how the language accompanies it.

If you could give a guarentee that using IDs would prevent people from being wrongly disenfranchised, then I would have to take a deeper look at the issue. Or maybe if it could help institute a system that let you vote anywhere in the state (say a barcode on your id with your county that would automatically pull up your ballet at the voting booth). Or even if it was just thrown into an overall voting bill that had good provisions for increasing access (making voting a national holiday in all states, automatic registration, increased voting hours/days, etc) as a compromise.

Blueberry cleansers and masks are too harsh for my skin. The Tony Moly Blueberry Mask leaves me blotchy (but aight skin the next day I guess, but not worth) and the Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser is way more drying than I wanted, especially over time.

This is not true! This sandwich was listed for $5.81 at Five Guys at 808 H St NW in DC! I am not a liar nor a karma whore! I don't have my receipt any more but I can show you the statement on my debit card! The sandwich was around $6 and my small cajun fries were $3.83.

Another thing to consider is that your mind will lag your actual progress. You said, "I hate my body!" and this means there a good chance you have a poor self image. Your brain may deny you a real look at your real self in the mirror and your pictures; it will super impose what it thinks you look like over what you actually look like. It often starts after you lose about 10% or more of your weight   your friends notice, but you can see it. Expect it. It just a funny odd thing that brains do.

Jesse Hall of Gunnison, a skier known for pushing limits (and big cliffs), made his gold medal bid with a never been done before gap jump over the mouth of Carrot Chute.

First, you can talk to your BF. You can show him some of her texts. You can tell him that it hurt to think that her irrational belief that your cooking ability was a slap in the face to her meant that you could no longer share something you loved to share with his family. You can let him know that, from your POV, it feels as though, despite the fact that she has been actively unkind to you, and told outright lies about you to his brother and his family, you are the one who is being made to feel as though you are in the wrong, and how much that hurts.
I called a cabby and asked how much it would cost to get a ride home (to the next town over) and he said, $50. The only thing I could think of, was ask one to drive me, and then get my landlord to cover me for the money when i got to my place.

One example I really like is from English itself: We have the word house, denoting a building in which a family resides; but also the word home, specifically denoting such place in which one has an emotional connection.

Until recently, much of what we've learned about endorphins has been gained from monitoring endorphins in the human bloodstream and in rats' brains.

100% disagree. Yes, there a lot of randomness in hockey, that why the team with the best odds only has 11% to win the cup, but it crazy to say that no one can say whether one path is easier or not. If we have to play the ducks, avs, and canucks to get to the final, would you really say that we can say that an easier path than having to play the Pens, Leafs, and Caps? Of course we can say that the first scenario is an easier path. Does that mean we won get bounced by the Ducks in the first round? Of course that could happen, that doesn mean that our path is actually harder. 1 point  submitted 1 month ago
