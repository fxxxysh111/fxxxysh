They largely copied Forerunner designs they stumbled upon and because of their religious attachment, wouldn improve or innovate with them. At one point, some Spartans take control of a Covenant frigate and Cortana uses it to obliterate several other equivalent covenant frigates because the weapon and shield systems were so under optimized she could immediately improve performance several times over just by tweaking some things.So yeah ultimately Humanity was on the better trajectory because they were aggressively innovating and developing on everything they had, though their survival at Earth was largely because the Covenant Civil War gave them the breathing room to seize the initiative.JerikTelorian  23 points  submitted 5 months agoThis is fairly common, historically.

"Some day soon, perhaps in forty years, there will be no one alive who has ever known me. That when I will be truly dead   when I exist in no one memory.

Sportsbooks in Nevada have never offered wagers on the Oscars. The state has a long history of resisting wagering on non sporting events even explicitly banning bets on things like elections but opened up slightly in 2011 by allowing wagers on the World Series of Poker, the first event bets allowed on something beyond a traditional sport.

I can defend security. I was going in and out of the store multiple times during the weekend (albeit via blink) but the regular line was never super long except on the first day, which is of course when people are buying all the stuff they expect to sell out.

Last year when I was trying to buy pins in the DMF area I waited 3 hours just to get into the room. Not saying the lines are great, but last year it was managed way better than in years past.

That could work, but it might be too finicky because the game has to "understand" you and AI that listens usually has problems with doing that, even if you speak clearly and perfectly, but have even the slightest accent or tone variation. However in my opinion, the main reason to have a silent protagonist is so you can have more options to choose from since they aren spending money on a more high end VA for the main character. That is the reason why most games with a voiced protagonist usually have to limit their responses, which can work well with the right kind of game.

I hope BGS isn too focused on grounding it in science. It could work if they come up with science for the special powers (like with Biotics in ME), but most people talking about grounding it probably mean they want it to be hard science, even if it is still sci fi. I feel, despite what some will say, that would limit your play style too much, even if there were different factions and endings. That alone wouldn be enough and players would get bored (even with different difficulties though most will probably stick to one) and they would just started speeding through the game each time until coming to a different cut scene.
I think what you are referring to is transmutation where radioactive isotopes are subjected to neutron irradiation to try and convert them into shorter lived isotopes which are easier to manage in the long term. It is an old idea that has never been practically implemented. you need to chemically process your radioactive material to separate only the isotopes that can benefit from irradiation. Generally a messy process. Then you irradiate the partitioned material, but you can target individual atoms, so you will be creating some mess by neutron irradiating some material you don want to. sufficiently effective to be worth its cost and hazards) it might become one of a basket of measures used to manage some specific isotopes.
While in the late stages of the rush poker tournament you will need to know there are 2 types of players. First the players that are going after the win. Second the players playing just to stay a little longer to get a higher payout. You want to focus on the players going for the win. They are the ones you will be face against in the last 2 tables.

"Man like," said Miss Cornelia, and subsided into silence over a complicated arrangement of tucks until Captain Jim deliberately stirred her up again by remarking in a casual way:
Not only can a cunning person lie to other people   she can also lie to herself. This may seem minor, but it's an important ability for a cunning person to have at her disposal, as it allows her to mentally convince herself that she's confident, that she's not likely to be caught, etc., which in turn makes her appear externally calm and relaxed.

I mean I agree things are definitely heightened/exaggerated but I always saw it as being staged as a tragic melodrama, as many Darren Aronofsky movies are (the first sounds of the film are a symphony warming up, as if you were in a theater about to watch some operatic performance). The theme of the film is not "drugs are bad" but how addiction and the pursuit of happiness and the American Dream can get tangled and lead to one's self destruction, in this case it's characters using drugs to obtain that goal.

Kyle Cooper, who created the film's title sequence, compared Sable to Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man.

The most screen time this work saw was an eight minute montage pocketed away on the DVD.

There can be specific gotchas   like, trying to work in Unicode / multibyte text in PHP is a pain in the ass   but otherwise, any language that has regularly been used for web applications in the last decade or so has all the basic essential capabilities.

It might still be a while after you work through your issues for you to find someone you like and want to get physical with.

You shouldn feel compelled to keep at it just to check virginity off a to do list.
Figure out possible combinations. I think exhaustive checking is feasible with these numbers. The result of this step is a list of combinations, where each combination has a type (set, street, or pair) and a pattern with the cards used (could be a bitmap).

Nothing is more wild than people who try to argue to a black community that they shouldn love this country enough to pay taxes when 60 years ago it was people just like you telling us to take out pay day loans to make ends meet.
This is what I don understand about your argument. Your scenario is frighteningly plausible but I just don see the logical jump to banning guns. And in the very slight chance that the government goes too far and the country ends up like Syria, why would you not want to be armed? There isn a scenario where banning guns benefits you. You choosing between really fucked and 100% fucked. I rather just be really fucked.
Unbelievable. They were removed by Security.

And it explains why the board took action. 
? How far would you go not just to make millions but to be in thick with Hollywood's a list, friendly with actors on an first name basis, Matt, Ben, Leo? One woman nearly paid with her life to be part of the high stakes world, even when she was 3,000 miles away if Hollywood. 
I gotta check the scans for Deku at 20% again in all honesty. But I don remember seeing anything that implies Deku is a 10 tonner at 20%. Even though MCU Spidey is still green compared to his adult self, he still has ridiculous feats like catching a speeding car in one arm. 
It is a country where companies are people with more rights than most people. 
Meanwhile every good British show is remade by Americans because it considered untenable to have to deal with accents and cultural references they won understand, and you have classic films like The Castle, edited to reference American culture, and cut out Australian references, despite it being a deeply Australian film. If someone never has to engage that sort of critical thinking, or have to frame anything in a new cultural context, it clear why they would struggle with it.

But I think for some other games, function approximation of some sort would be quite useful.DeepStack uses deep learning, but it not clear how effective it was. It didn beat prior top bots head to head, for example. I think the reason DeepStack did reasonably well is because it uses nested subgame solving, which was developed by both teams independently and concurrently. 
Snapped off an all in, and at showdown he grabbed his stack and just left quickly. My card room is upstairs from the main casino only accessible by elevator, which has a (poor excuse for a) security guard stationed in front of it to check IDs.

Depositing or withdrawing with credit or debit cards is not charged by BetFred itself, but it might be by other institutions that may be involved in the processing of the transaction. 
See, without keeping realistic expectations of the way online casinos operate, you can end up chasing some pretty crazy dreams that can land you in the poorhouse within minutes. Never under any circumstances risk everything on one desperate bet. That's tantamount to buying a lottery ticket, and everyone knows you're not going to win that.

Artificial Superintelligence borrows the 'flick to decide' innovation from Reigns (which, OK, really began with Tinder, but let's move on), but in this choose 'em up, you rule over a Silicon Valley codeshop creating a superintelligent computer. That computer is CARROT, the snarky AI star of several sarcastic lifestyle apps. CARROT's personality and the amusing script support the bizarre setup of you making a glorious mess of things over a multitude of alternative universes, from merely losing your company to accidentally blowing up the world as you juggle competing demands from investors, staff, governments and trolls on the internet. The variety of comic outcomes and wealth of events and choices make it moreish, if limited fun.

I mean, not to point any fingers but I think it AA4 fault, as that kinda started the new "non trilogy era", and many seem to dislike DD for the reason that they try really hard to "fanservice" the trilogy again with some characters, whilst also making Phoenix take the helm for no reason other then sales. SoJ continues on that, and I think that also one of the reasons why people are so upset with some of the writing, as it straight up doesn work canonically.

As played fold to the raise for the same reason. Flatting the cr is probably the worst option as a shove will fold out some hands that beat you (10 or j and also get value from some combos you are ahead of. Lastly your rational for calling the cr is bad as there are literally NO turn blanks for your hand. 
My husband plays poker at a friend's home, this in itself does not bother me. The one thing that would bother me is that he stays there all night, like from 8pm to 4am. Eventually, I was okay with this on condition that he goes to poker only Monday Thursday, weekend is family time. He was really happy with this because poker is a weekday thing for him anyway. Last night, DH (dear husband) asked if he could go to poker and I said no, he could go during the week. Turns out that after I went to bed around 10pm, he went to poker! I woke up at 330 because LO (little one) was crying and that's when I found he was gone. Thishas happened once earlier this year; he claimed he had to stay at work late but I later found out he went to poker.

Exactly. And my parents struggles individually and together helped motivate me to not have kids. Due to their abuse and my current state of no patience and tolerance, I can barely handle one dog without going nuts. I was so hard on her as a puppy and I deeply regret it. Not physical abuse, but a lot of yelling because of normal puppy behavior (chewing, messes, etc.) and she's so skittish now. I worry that I would break a kid, like my parents did me. So I think it's best that I don't.

So while all the examples above are just bad beats/coolers, I would continue to study your game and think about the smaller spots that you auto pilot or skim over because chances are you also have leaks that exist in your game or sometimes even become worse when dealing with a downswing. My advice would be to study more and think about the parts of your game that you can change.

If we were going to try to sell the house after she dies, we'd now have to pay off whatever she ends up owing (which will probably be a sizable amount) before anything could go to us. The house could also go into foreclosure if she doesn't meet the terms of the reverse mortgage, which would be stressful for everyone and I wager she would try to crash here (but that's a no from me). It's mostly just BEC irritation on my part since she defended herself to the teeth regarding making DH into a human shield from her debt collectors, and this just proves she was only ever concerned about herself.
Where I work, we needed to get work done where we did not have the manpower to get said work done. Our Board didn care how that work got done as long as it was within budget. That was passed down the ranks until someone in middle management suggested we contract that work out instead of hiring new employees to do the work as it wasn long term work. 
Reports coming in from our highway forecasters traveling on roadways early this morning or doing mitigation work have stated: "there isn a piece of avalanche terrain that hasn slid." This is incredible, but shocking news given the impressive avalanche cycle over the past few days. This second round of heavy snowfall has put storm totals for March into historic levels. Combine these amounts with strong winds and we have some of the most dangerous avalanche conditions in years. Crews are out to keep the major roadways open, but further travel in or around avalanche terrain is not recommended. Even at lower elevations, a high rain line has increased the risk of wet avalanches. Under these exceptional conditions, expect all avalanche paths, both small and large to slide.

There's a small but non zero chance that he's arrogant enough to think he'll win and will proceed onwards to an election. We've seen it before with his leadership spill   he was beaten twice because he failed to adequately assess the competition and ploughed on ahead.

Kali Mur (Potassium Chloride). This remedy is for white secretions. Think pimples with white stuff inside. It's also for clear, egg white, slimy secretions.

If you're not generating revenue for any of the parties involved then there is no incentive to participate. If you're just trading goods or services for a promise for other goods and services later, it effectively IS bartering. You've simply over complicated it by adding an extra step to the process, by adding in this arbitrary "contributor" currency that only has perceived value within the system you're attempting to support.
Instead, I met a series of polite and friendly men, who came to the Red Rooster because it wasn't like other places in Vegas: no pretense and no bullsht, with well defined rules.

Occupational licensing can be good policy when it levels off information asymmetry between patient and provider, but in the United States, the licensing apparatus historically has been a board of market participants.

I work in Massachusetts where charters and private schools are managed and paid for out of the public education budget. There very limited oversight and they sweep a lot under the rug because they can. Schools absolutely should be managed by a higher governing board, because if they arent, abuses run rampant. And I mean abuse of both students and staff. The schools hide it because they don want to affect profit. They claim to be managed by the state department, and they came for an inspection once, but we had advanced notice.
I called his ex that night and told her not to go to the wedding (didin give her any explanation even though she asked). The wedding happened a few days later and the marriage lasted a month.

Some massage chairs monitor the user's responses to the massage, adjusting intensity and concentrating on specific areas on the fly. The Sanyo Zero Gravity Massage Chair includes sensors that monitor galvanic skin response. This is the same sort of technology lie detector machines use to monitor a person's response to questioning. The galvanic sensors measure the user's pulse rate and perspiration. When the chair detects an increase in these metrics, it interprets the data to mean that the area currently being massaged is particularly tense or stiff. The chair's microprocessor alters the normal pattern to spend more time on that area [source: Sanyo].

Remember in high school, or for some of you, yesterday, when all it took to cement a ruined reputation was a single outrageous rumor? Usually one started by a glue sniffer who said they knew someone who knew someone who thought they saw so and so "doing it" with a janitor's dust broom? (In the butt?) Remember that? Sometimes reading the Greek historian Plutarch feels like someone took all those high school rumors and codified them in classy English leather.

JF Ptak Science Books Post don have that much to say about the series of images that I found in the 5 December 1908 issue of Scientific American except for "Wow!" Sometimes that is about all I can manage, and that fine. (Richard Feynman, on witnessing the Alamogordo test shot in the desert in 1945, simply said "hot dog!", which was quite a distance away from Oppenheimer reaction, and one which I like more.) Anyway, opening up the volume and by chance opening to this full pager was very pleasantly surprising, and this from a journal which was very successful in achieving their constant goal of being "surprising". As you can well see, "wow" can be shared:The bird view has a peculiar 3D sense to it you could make any of the bridges pop to life by changing your angle of perspective, like so:I have posted numerous times on German propaganda pamphlets illustrated with maps showing Germany besieged (1925 1935): hordes of planes, hundreds of thousands of troops, legions of tanks, mountains of artillery pieces, and so on, all graphically displayed quite well enough to strike some fear into the heart of a reader even with just a casual glance seeing their red hot rolling menace to the Fatherland.

Born in so I was a kid when this went down.

Respawn knows what they are doing there. Ironically, I think it also runs at a 20Hz tickrate.

I deal with purchasing materials for road commissioners and construction projects and see invoices daily at my job and even the smallest company has more information on their invoices and looked more legit than this one. So forgive me for not believing that the plain piece of paper you threw in front of me with no header from Nissan or any other graphic is legit. So when everyone tells me I am stupid and to shut up it just propagates consumers beliefs about lying salesmen and these tactics. I get it, your dealership is very above those tactics, but not all are. And there is no way to tell which dealership you are at, so when you tell me you don all I hear is lies which sours the experience for me and the next dealer I talk to because I assume they do the same tricks.

Did you know that people are a lot more likely to die by suicide if they have a parent that did? It's not just genetics, like you're more likely to be depressed because it's hereditary. If you have a parent that dies by suicide, it messes with you and makes you more likely to do it yourself. Suicide in general is kind of contagious, and knowing that has stopped me from wanting to do it myself   I wouldn't want to think that I might be making someone I love more likely to want to die..

Players at that stake (if they are even around) are the most qualified to answer that question, but since you asked it here where the quantity of them may be low, I will offer a guess. I imagine strong 50/100 players have an incredibly solid foundation of the basic fundamentals of poker, such as being able to recognize the GTO line in the majority of spots, as well as to identify their opponents play based off of their tendencies rather quickly so that they can deviate to more exploitative play. This enables the solid players to unleash their arsenal of moves including squeezing, defending, floating, barreling, 3betting light, overbetting, donking, etc. Of course, these plays are certainly seen in 1/2, they are just performed incorrectly at a much higher frequently. The biggest thing by far that I expect 50/100 players do that 1/2 players aren doing is folding instead of limping.

So how meaningful is that if we apply it to the reported Cobb angles at the start of the study of 28.58.8 degrees.
