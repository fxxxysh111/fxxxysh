The main problem with this whole left/right political mess right now is that both sides assume that both sides are incredibly radical.

Seriously though OP if it were me, the girl would've known how much I had played prior to her moving in and been comfortable with it. If you can't live in your own skin and do what you have a true passion for what's the point of living together? The best way to prove to her that you can do it is prove to her that you're a winning player. Track your play. Buy her something nice, go out to eat, etc when you win. That's what I do. Poker helps pays for our food splurging, extra vacations, shit that I wouldn't be able to afford if I didn't play. It's a good feeling.

It told the audience that this isn't a happily ever after type story. In the face of cold, calculating, bloodthirsty politics the good guys and people with high morals get destroyed like they're nothing, or pay immense prices for it. This is re emphasized at other points in the series as well, like Daenerys Targaryen and company suddenly being attacked by all those assassins during the Slave Cities arc; could have just executed a bunch of nobles and major slave merchants and avoided that whole mess. 
The inflammation is likely a result of eating a high carbohydrate diet. When you go low carb, eating more fat (including more cholesterol), the inflammation in your body goes down. Your body then doesn need so much cholesterol coursing through your veins to repair the damage from the inflammation. So although you are eating more cholesterol, your body is just processing it for energy and only making the necessary levels for typical body repair/processes rather than damage control from inflammation. That why people who go low carb typically notice lower cholesterol levels than they previously had (although not always). In addition, low carbers are making more of the fluffy LDL rather than the dense LDL.

That's something that I found is true, but if you look around there should be smoke shops who have them for very decent prices. I want to a shop where they were 40 80 each, kept driving for another 10 minutes to the next headship where I got a downstem of equal or better quality for less than 20.

Many glass walkers use broken wine or champagne bottles. Unlike broken bottle necks or drinking glasses, these pieces have a relatively gentle curve. When you step down, the pieces shift against each other, moving the edges away from your foot. But the surface involved in a glass walk is not like your kitchen floor. In a glass walk, the weight of your body is spread out over lots of pieces, which have the freedom to move. When you step on a single sliver of glass, your weight is concentrated over that one sharp point. In addition, if you accidentally cut yourself on a piece of glass, the culprit is usually the movement of your skin along the sharp edge. Walking on glass, on the other hand, requires you to put your feet straight down onto the edges, not to slide them around on the surface.
But how do you propose we welcome the types of young men who are inclined towards MRA?

Diagonal layering may provide the best compromise, but it tends to be a big pain in the ass and a waste of plywood. 
The evening's festivities concluded with the presentation of the Robert L.

The recipient of the 2015 Robert L. Brunning Memorial Award was the City of Madison Fire Department.

We are proud to be honored by the Dane County EMS Association with this award, but prouder still to be serving you, the citizens of Madison.

The amount wagered on greyhound racing in Florida decreased from $1.5 billion in 1992, adjusted for inflation, to just over $200 million in 2017, state records show. After paying bettors, purses and taxes, five tracks reported losses on live greyhound racing last year and the then 12 tracks combined net revenue on live racing was $20 million. That about a fifth their poker net.

Most of the work for GM is in understanding gene function and figuring out how to manipulate the function or expression. Once that is understood, the same modifications can potentially be applied to many different strains or even species, meaning there could be greater diversity than when a strain has been traditionally bred. In traditional breeding, there's no simple way to transfer the desired traits to other plants. In GM there often is; that's the point of GM.

I had also become acutely aware that I was a role model for kids, which I felt like I was supposed to find cool but actually found upsetting. My great "contribution" to society was walking onto an overlit Nickelodeon set shouting lines about fried chicken (my character liked fried chicken) and that's what kids were looking up to? Granted, we can't all be Pema Chodron, but there was something about the shallowness of my success that made me resent it.. 
They fear blacks because they know if the shoe was on the other foot they would retaliate. They would want to be as mean to us as we were to them. And that terrifying. It just happens to be false.
"If you are indeed a stem cell research proponent, hold that women have sovereignty over their bodies, agree LBGTQ persons are no different than anyone else, and reject the idea that the Bible is literal and inerrant" I exactly hold that women do indeed hold sovereignty over their bodies.

With yet another rain break having annulled any hopes of a result in the County Championship match between Yorkshire and Sussex at Headingley in 2007, the only game in town for the home side was increasing their over rate to avoid a points deduction. Wisden reports that "the game descended into farce" as Yorkshire rushed through 5.2 overs in eight minutes, with overseas player Younus Khan getting through a quickfire four overs   one of them completed in a record 35 seconds. Which, rather surprisingly, makes Younus Khan the fastest bowler in the history of cricket..

H2: You have less than 100bb to start the hand and then the straddle is thrown on. With a straddle we treat it as the new big blind   therefore you have only 38 BB. With such a big opening raise and so many callers, this looks like an easy all in preflop unless you know the original raiser is a big nit. The combination of the chips we win with fold equity ($85) and our equity even if we get called makes it a good jam. As played post flop looks fine.

Magritte was not a "literary" artist, and his work was more about situation than narrative. Nevertheless, his titles were important to him, and they are never neutral. They were, so to speak, pasted on the image like another collage element, inflecting its meaning without explaining it. They reflected his browsing in high and popular culture. The Glass Key comes from Dashiell Hammett, and references to the Fantomas thrillers (on which Magritte, along with the rest of the Surrealists and everyone else in France and Belgium, doted) are everywhere. On the other hand, The Man from the Sea is Balzac's title, and The Elective Affinities Goethe's.

Few major studio productions explicitly aim to educate their audience, and non Asian viewers going to this film may just want to see a glitzy rom com. But many might walk out with a deeper understanding of the class gradations even just within Singaporean society, and the collectivist vs. individualist tensions found in many Asian families. And there no obvious stereotyping. For decades, female Asian actors have been asked to portray stereotypes like the vindictive dragon lady, the submissive China doll, the nerdy overachiever or the inert sex worker. Crazy Rich Asians avoids all of these, instead showing the nuances of Asian women experiences across generations.
(Call it a "playlist" if that makes you more comfortable.) "Imagine" indulges in a double fantasy of intimate kink, but that soon gives way to an IRL push and pull: First she's "Needy," then on "NASA" she's demanding space, finally she comes full circle on "In My Head," where she realizes her lover is just the sum of her hopeful projections. "7 Rings" felt a bit pinched and mercenary as a single, but here its retail rebound suitably sets up the title track's graceful lessons learned, which are in turn upended by "Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored," where our restless heroine sets off to mess her life up all over again.

When I shower I cry because I hurt so bad all over I can deal. When I went to the ER on Wednesday for a suspected blood clot I broke down because they didn take my surgery pain seriously and left me in the room for 6 hours without any pain meds and interrogated me on why I was on what I was on.

Never show your hand if you win refers to not showing your hand if you bet, and everyone else folds. In that case, you win no matter what the community cards (the five cards in the middle of the table) are. If you win this way in an earlier betting round, they won't even finish dealing the community cards out. In those cases, you're totally allowed to just throw your cards away face down (wait for them to push the chips your way).
Most people are kind enough to ask "how much would you charge for this thing I want" but I don't take requests generally.

This is the entire problem with ALL of American work culture today and I was relaying this exact sentiment to a friend about the crazy anxiety levels here. I said:
DeepStack solves a depth limited subgame on the first two betting rounds by estimating values at the depth limit via a neural network. This allows it to always calculate real time responses to opponent off tree actions, while Libratus typically plays instantaneously according to its pre computed blueprint strategy in the first two rounds (except that it uses its subgame solver if the pot is large).

By extension she has endorsed the former attorney general refusal to overrule that decision. For the flipside of prosecutorial discretion is prosecutorial independence, hallowed by centuries of common law and, as the judge wrote, and fundamental to the criminal justice system.

Assuming it is the former and not the later, throwing him in prison may make him to wake up and realize that what he did was illegal and immoral and should not be done in the future or it could also give him access to "the criminal network" and he come out of prison worse than before.

Not if history has anything to say about it. Toothpaste might actually predate the toothbrush. While there's evidence ancient Egyptians were using toothbrushes as far back as 3500 BCE, recipes for tooth powder have been found that date back to 5000 BCE. The earliest Egyptian tooth powder recipe contained plenty of abrasives to scrape off all the sticky residue: the ashes of burnt egg shells and oxen hooves mixed with pumice seemed to be popular. By the fourth century, Egyptians had fancied up their tooth powder with abrasives like rock salt and flavorings like mint and peppercorns   they even added dried iris flower, perhaps because it was associated with purification. Good thing our tooth enamel is harder than bone   or even iron or steel. If it wasn't, those Egyptians would have brushed their teeth right down to nubs.

I'm honestly shocked at how many people have said child support never goes to the kid, it's not intended to be handed over to the child to put in savings or to buy frivolous things but instead to help pay the costs of raising a kid and to ensure that the child has a similar lifestyle in both homes. 
Agreed, I tell them to do what MM says and let me know if they find something else. or I tell them BTW the XYZ is acting up.
Get a ranch home feel by adding a different array of tables to your living room mix. A teak side table made of reclaimed teak timbers from aged farm homes, abandoned ox carts, and other weathered farm implements would be practical choices. You could play cards in style with a fancy poker table and chairs made out of European beech wood. 
Ada (pronounced Aid a) is a city of about 17,000 people, the county seat of Pontotoc County, ninety miles southeast of Oklahoma City.

The existence of such a Behavior is something which is consistent with Reflex semantics, but which it also gives you no tools to define at the moment.In the earlier FRP systems that Ryan and I worked on which did have such a behaviour, it would destroy performance anywhere that you actually used it, because a behaviour that is guaranteed to have a different value every time it is observed has a tendency to invalidate all the caches it comes into contact with.

We really don't deviate from our base personality all that much in life, I think. Like, sure, we mature and our opinions may change, but who we are at the core, I think never really changes. Funny kids grow to be funny adults and then funny seniors, deep thinkers stay deep their whole lives (or at least until they shoot them selves /s) and conventional people often remain conventional. 
I think it kind of funny, but, there no humour to be found on this sub these days. It interesting that every single time there movement in this case they will dismiss it as being nothing. Now they ARE supporting LITERALLY NOTHING and trying to turn a simple tiny edit into a big deal.
River comes an ace, she bet, check shove. If you look at the information just based on what you have it makes total sense for him to have Aces, or AQ, there's no way he has the confidence the check shove AK because he has already represented a good hand. 
Absolutely. I got used to right handed mousing when sharing computers as a kid and through college and grad school. As an adult with my own computer at home and work, I set everything up left handed, and kept it that way for years. But then I injured my left thumb and switched back. It felt weird for about a week. Now it seems totally normal, and I find that it incredibly convenient to be able to write while using a computer in conference rooms, etc. Thumb is all better, but I might never go back. TBH, it hardly makes a difference. Like a stick shift, I think you use it on the side you find it. Switching is not particularly difficult. If I were doing super fine motor graphic design or something, I think I want to use my left, but that not my line of work. For ordinary word processing and web research, it makes not a bit of difference.
Wagoner insists that Buick has a future, and he is coaxing dealers to group their Buick, Pontiac and GMC franchises under one roof. Now GM must create some products for them to sell.
Not good. The Bank of Canada warned last month that we had slid into a soft patch. However, the central bank's idea of a weaker fourth quarter was an annual growth rate of 1.3 per cent, the estimate from its latest outlook, published last month.
None of it is really justified. To me, he seems really disrespectful and rude towards others when he doesn't get his way, in cards and in life. People just brush this off because he's "charming" in a cynical sort of way, which I admit can be funny.

You know that feeling where you decide you've been so card dead so you decide you're going to get a bit saucy with the 64s and 3bet from the btn against some random plum from your local casino that hasn't stopped shouting over the sports all night. You might be thinking that moment when the dealer slowly drags the 357 from the deck to reveal that you have in fact, flopped the joint, but you would be wrong.

Listen to new music that excites you to liven up boring tasks. Most people listen to familiar music passively, hearing it in the background while doing other things. Update your playlist by finding new music to listen to. Find music that makes you want to get up and dance or music that will help pass time while doing household chores or while walking from place to place. This will make listening to music more of an activity and less of an ambiance.[3]

So the fear is very real and it not because of how likely it is to happen statistically but that you can end up in one of these spaces where you have no chance of justice.

One last thing I'd say though   I think it would be worthwhile for you to be proficient in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) too, particularly some of the more advanced CSS2.1 and CSS3 stuff that will be available cross browser when IE8 is released (because it's already supported in FF, Opera, and Safari), and become familiar with javascript libraries like YUI. I often see people writing crazy server side code for things that could much more easily be accomplished in CSS and / or a bit of javascript.

This was at a time when retail prices were officially unchanged, leading to huge increases in consumption.Compounded onto this was the large scale extensive growth in the land scheme, where huge amounts of soviet investment were put into fertilizing and preparing the Kazakhstan region for cultivation. These types of projects were common throughout the soviet era, as for planned economies an extensive growth in the inputs of production is much easier to accomplish then the intensive growth with existing inputs as we see in modern economies.The early surge in farm production encouraged him to talk in 1957 of overtaking American per capita meat production by 1975, something to which the Soviet Union never came close.

You'll make $5 and hour in daytime, which is 40$ to pay for your drinks at night, but you are beating the micro tables online, so you sure as hell can beat the $1/$2 live game and now you have a good shot to try and make yourself 100BB a night (200$). You aren't currently a winning player at 2NL. The gap to achieve this is going to take you hundreds (if you are exceptionally talented/have perfect study habits) of hours and more likely thousands of hours. If you put that effort into many other endeavors it's likely you'll make far more than your desired 24k/year. If you aren't in the US it's possible this isn't true but the games are also going to be much more difficult and require an even higher skill to achieve your goals.

Joplin was such a fucking disaster. Every so often there's just a spring that'll tear the absolute hell out of Dixie alley and it feels like it's already happening. Tornado outbreak last Sunday and the storm prediction center is predicting another potentially violent weekend in a few days.. 
By being so black and white about it, they really just turn people off their line of discussion and end up achieving nothing much at all. There are many more appropriate organisations out there which are effective in fighting for better treatment and awareness than PETA.
What a petty, nasty, and malicious thing to do to when she knew full well he was your designated driver! Ask a trusted friend or family member to deal with her if she tries to show up.

The best part though was that the police held my car for over 3 weeks afterwards because the crash classified my car as being involved in a hit and run. On the tree. They wouldn even let the insurance adjuster do his job, so I couldn begin looking for a replacement for nearly a month.

She probably thought that's the way the show was done. As for the food, she just flew for over 15 hours and then was literally drained in that hot car. I can't imagine anyone wanting a bowl of hot canned stew.

Because the start of your commute is a place of your choosing. This sounds like you are advocating for paying employees differently for a factor that has nothing to do with their job experience or performance, which is inherently discriminatory. Wouldn you be pissed of an equally qualified employee got paid an extra $200 per month for doing the same exact job as you and working the same hours just because they bought a house out by the beach instead of closer to the city?.

Never forget the 'absent' rhyme. So you can't find a word that rhymes with 'cactus'? Who cares? There's no point in letting the flow of your thought ebb for such a minor detail. 
Since this comment has gotten a lot of traction, I really recommend people watch this channel called Sexplanations out for answers to more questions regarding sex and sexuality. The host is really informative and doesn't beat around the bush.
This made me think that reducing a patient's suffering is a way that I can inspire others to find their voice. A person who is suffering can't express their voice.

By the time we got back to find Rob, we think the whole pub, the pub next door, the smokers outside, the people in the few shops in the high street and the old man walking his dog all knew that we were sat on Table 28! You had to be there when the waitress called out "Table 28!!".

I failed out of nursing school in my last semester yesterday. I was so upset, but I came home and had Pepperoni and some bell peppers with cream cheese when I really wanted carbs. I can do BPC (yuck), so I drinking coffee with sweet n low and heavy cream and will try IF today. I will pick myself back up and reapply to the program, but I won be able to get in until the fall, unfortunately so this summer is going to suck a bit. I never failed at school before. The kicker is that this was supposed to be my third degree and I 38 years old. I feel really ashamed and embarrassed.

There are too many unknowns, but I can tell right off from your complaints that you feel very entitled to control your daughter personal life choices. Why? Job? Church? Why do you think your adult daughter owes you any say in those choices? She not doing anything illegal, so how about respect her choices and leave her alone?

There are different approaches to classifying religion, with the recognition that there are cultural phenomena (like Confucianism or nationalism) that we might argue about. The favored approach today is to say that religions tend to share a group of characteristics, including some reference to a transcendent reality (beyond the material world), practices and rituals of worship, moral codes, placing importance in sacred objects and places, shared stories, and so on. The example of LOTR seems to be defining a possible religion based on a text, but that is only one dimension of what we tend to call religion. 
There also /r/hanguk, which is a Korean language sub, but it slow because Korean citizens who haven lived abroad overwhelmingly don know what reddit is.. 
I always gotten the impression that he had a much bigger cultural impact in the US than he had here in Australia. Here he was just seen as an overenthusiastic kids entertainer, whose propensity to ham it up (carry on like a pork chop, we say) for the cameras tended to overshadow his good work in wildlife conservation and education in the general consciousness. At least, it did during his life, but time has since been good to awareness of his legacy domestically..

If you take his non drugged state as a control state, it pretty easy to settle the point. 
As far as the mom splaining stuff goes, just keep saying that you, your OB and when he time comes your pediatrician have decided that this is the best way to do things. "Mom, best practices have changed since you were raising babies. This is all backed up with the latest research, and my doctors and I agree that this is best for me and the baby." And, dear Heavenly God, but the "times have changed" think is so totally the truth. There are 10 years between my oldest and youngest, and I pretty much had to start over on some ways of doing things by the time Kid5 came around.
For example there is a long and involved and devastating review of Frank Dickee (a successful and highly Victorian (almost Victorian velveteen)) piece, concentrating on the Moon, which presented many problems to the sci observer, with the assault on the Moon of Dickee occupying about 20% of the entire article.

WoD is an immense resource to tap from, you could be able to make any kind of single player experience, from a CRPG to a FPRPG to a FPS, to a point and click adventure, or a thriller, a horror game, really anything. Even a MMO. I just hope they wont screw it up either. 
It sucks. 
She didn speak any English, but I can get by clumsily with Thai. She didn mind, so neither did I. (Note if you cannot speak Thai, or consider it important for the girl to speak English, most girls in the Huay Khwang area massage parlours do not. They tend to be superior venues but the Sukhumvit joints are where to go for better English language service.) She was very sweet and cute, not at all shy, kissed, and seemed to enjoy the sex in an affectionate way. Would have been a 10/10 if she spoke English.9/10

The Kerry Lugar Bill is about giving Pakistan money. For the Americans, the legislation may have evolved into becoming an instrument of democratisation, an instrument of imperialism, or an instrument of development and it may even be possible that it is all three, or none of the three. But for Pakistan, the bill has always been about one thing: money.

Oh yes I have gas bubbles all the time that I can feel go up and just disappear. Not sure whether it anxiety or not, but I can tell you I started taking cymbalta a few months back along with CBD oil and it done wonders for my mental health and I actually noticed less heartburn and GERD symptoms in general. My gastro ENT definitely said that the bi products of anxiety (tense muscles, less controlled breathing, etc.) definitely will aggravate and exacerbate my symptoms..
