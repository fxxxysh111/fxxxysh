I realize I used an anecdote to make a point. Not the best way to do that. But, I mean, everyone loves until they find a reason to stop. Animals don go "Oh you know what, I hate the way he cleans pans and doesn contribute to chores, ugh." I think it far more about violating their trust that makes them stop loving you. And I think that takes a lot more effort to make happen than a human falling out of love with you. Cats, I think, are a lot harder to earn their love. It easy to love them but violate their boundaries, unlike dogs. Dogs just don have a lot of boundaries. But if you loved someone to pieces and they just disappeared one day, you still love them even a long time later. If you saw them again after several years, you still be so happy to see them because nothing happened to change how you feel about them. (Though we can realize that them disappearing may mean that they don love us or disrespect our friendship, so then we get mad and move on)

However, I did not read the pilates abstract.I would agree with your Doctor and your Personal Trainer, "I couldn quite get out of him what he meant by lighter weight and am not sure how this is measured. If I feel my back twinging on DLs, I lower the weight automatically." while resistance training may be detriment if resistance loads are excessively heavy, light load benefits are too great to resistance training all together.So, the Gold Standard of measuring Resistance Fitness in individuals is, 1 Repetition Maximum [1RM] (as you may know.) A 1RM is the max a person can lift, it is an all out effort.Consider this article from 1991 which reported, "The reaction moments at the knee, hip, and L4/L5 joints, and the compressive and shearing forces on L4/L5 are documented in powerlifters competing in a national powerlifting championship .

To the casual passenger, any airport can be a veritable hellmouth. The food sucks, the people who work there are unfriendly due to the soul sucking nature of working at a goddamn airport, the price of a beer makes Rupert Murdoch go, "Whoa." In an environment like this, a single canceled flight can send you screeching head first into madness. So, really, it's no surprise that there are airport themed conspiracy theories. What is surprising, however, is that almost all of them focus on a single place: Denver International Airport. The site is a hotspot for various, usually New World Order themed conspiracy theories that basically paint the place as a thinly veiled front for a massive murder factory fueled by the Illuminati Nazi devil. These are based on its supposedly swastika shaped runway layout ."Hey, Bob, look! There's a where they've vanquished that war demon and everyone lives happily ever after!"

Two, now the label of disability will follow you for the rest of your life as it had to be placed on federal forms.

While you do not have to disclose a learning disability many higher paying jobs will contact your school to confirm the information on your resume, if you do not list a learning disability but they find out you will be let go.

I was one of those people until about a year or two ago. Growing up, I was only ever taught how weed ruins your life and is a terrible drug. It instilled a massive fear in me that last until I was 30. Even after I decided I didn care if others did it, I wasn going to smoke. A few months ago, someone who I had massive respect for told me they smoke. After some soul searching I decided to give it a shot and now I smoke pretty frequently. But I don crave alcohol anymore, and I was probably drinking 2 3 drinks 4 5 times a week before.

He never got the flu shot before that because he didn think the flu was a big deal. Ever since then, he has gotten the shot.

While a few of the most famous American castles are merely theme park attractions, such as Busch Gardens DarKastle, Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle and Universal Hogwarts Castle, there are far many others that can mystify and entertain visitors and their children just as easily, yet offer a more realistic look on the history behind it and the extraordinary people who helped build them.

They do, however, give you a free buffet when you play for fours hours or more which was awesome and I took advantage of a lot of times before eating and going elsewhere..

Too much gripping can cause the muscles in the palm of the hand and inside of the forearm to tighten and cramp; frequent gentle stretching of both fingers and hand will help treat and prevent this from occurring (see Right).

I barely watch the movies, listen to the music, etc. I not religious and don have belief either.

JF Ptak Science Books Post entry in the neglected "Strange Things in the Sky" category.) The story "The Giant Atom" in Startling Stories was pretty striking to me, as it was published in December 19431 and (I thought) was illustrated with what looked like the first milliseconds of a nuclear explosion, except the reality of that event was still more than half a year away. There are a number of prescient atomic bomb stories written in the 50 years or so preceding the real one, and I thought that this one might be an odd, back door entry to the little sub genre..

I said in a post before, that BGS fans aren BGS fans for their epic MMO This was a shot in the dark and it was a big miss. But this is in no way a representative of the studio and their approach as a whole because we know what their USP is. For my own self, since it was shown at E3 2018, I basically ignored all coverage. I couldn care less about it. As far as I concerned it just an Elder Scrolls Online version for Fallout and if you look at it, the single player and multiplayer community are different for the Elder Scrolls and in my opinion, should be for Fallout. Just as the developers are different. It just happens that BGS are way bigger now and could just buy out Battlecry who an exclusively multiplayer studio. If it weren the case, I believe they would have just out sourced development and given the rights over. Their growth this decade is based upon everything before FO76. They get to innovate and mess around a little. They earned that right. Now, they have a foundation (the largest gaming area they ever made) to continue updating, patching and improving for the next decade, exactly like current multiplayer titles have been doing. We definitely see an appropriate variant. Thing is, with both Elder Scrolls and Fallout, they went to the past. The Fallout series is based on an alternate reality before moving forward.

One of the reasons Queensland started with very little public money was because of resistance to the separation of QLD from NSW by the NSW government.

So, if you want to blame anyone for the state of Brisbane's streets, blame NSW.

If you are baptized and the Elders (male heads of the congregation chosen by the governing body) decide that you have committed an offense, they decide if you are repentant enough.

Cities often outgrew their walls and only a small part of the center of the city was protected, usually with resource storage, the government, and homes of the wealthy inside.

As long as your personal taxes "Corp loan" lines up with your Corp tax filings you should be good as corps hardly ever get audited.

Of course people do this with physical illnesses too (let me tell you all the details of my HORRIBLE CANCER, feel sorry for me, I can help being such a jerk, everyone should give me free things because it so sad about my HORRIBLE CANCER, etc. Etc.) but IMO it even more insidious with mental illness because mental illnesses can push us to say and do selfish things without it being part of a broader manipulative pattern..

I feel, despite what some will say, that would limit your play style too much, even if there were different factions and endings. That alone wouldn be enough and players would get bored (even with different difficulties though most will probably stick to one) and they would just started speeding through the game each time until coming to a different cut scene..

Lastly, the really good registries allow you to add items and mark them as bought yourself. For example, my MIL insisted on putting her own twist to the things she bought us. That's fine, just please buy from the stores where we're registered so I can return them and buy the stuff we actually want without any hassle. I was able to find the item she bought online, put it on my registry, mark it as bought, and return it. The registry acts as a receipt of sorts even if they don't include a physical gift receipt with it. This was the case with Target and Macy's, where we registered.

(There are couple of other earlier and qualified contenders for "first skyscraper", but for here the Jenney building will work fine.) There was a boomlet of skyscrapers in Chicago beginning in the 1890 and the beginning of the Golden Age/Building Boom around 1900, so by 1908 the building style was well established, though "skyscraper" as a word applied to buildings was only 20 years old.

As I've said before, people love to run with myths, and sadly, this one is self sustaining: The misinformation brings a lot of vitriol, the vitriol prompts removals, and the removals result in more misinformation.

While at the same time, comments beginning with "I've heard." or "I've seen." get upvoted, read, and repeated by people who don't actually know anything about the situation..

Not the person you responded to but I am a CNA and I am in nursing school. I worked nights for almost 3 years before I got into nursing school full time and I still work part time nights and got go to school during the day. I love nights. I get paid better. No administration (except the house supervisor). It is not necessarily less work but it is less hectic. Your patients aren going to procedures. We rarely discharge at night. I have a 3 year old and it isn a big deal for him because I have always worked nights. Switching back and forth is doable, obviously it is more difficult that just staying on a regular sleep schedule. On the flip side, we tend to have poorer staffing than day shift. Some people have a lot of difficulty adjusting to sleeping in the daytime. It is worth trying, because financially night shift is great but it is not for everyone.

Do you use a power supply with the hard drive and does the light for activity light up and stay lit if not? That would indicate insufficient power for the hard drive, maybe try going through a powered USB hub or using a power supply for the HD if it supports one.

A strong earthquake in the Manila Trench an ocean trench west of the country that runs as deep as 5,400 meters could trigger tsunamis up to 11 feet tall that would hit Metro Manila in a little more than an hour.In an interview on "News to Go" aired Thursday, Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) Director Renato Solidum said Metro Manila and western Luzon has more than just the West Valley Fault to worry about.He said that if the Manila Trench shakes and causes a magnitude 8.2 earthquake, western Bataan can expect a wave up to 10 meters tall (around 32 feet) within five to ten minutes.Tsunami could also hit Occidental Mindoro, Zambales, Batangas and Cavite within minutes, he said."Ang [tsunami detection equipment] namin nandito sa Lubang (Mindoro) at Corregidor, tingnan mo yung Lubang, five minutes andoon na.

She is now following her feelings rather than letting a check list dictate who she dates.

Kuba hatte im Drei Lnder Vergleich die beste Infrastrutkur und ffentliche Daseinsvorsorge. Insbesondere, wenn man es mit Kolumbien vergleicht. Die Ungleichheit ist deutlich Sprbar. Die schwarze Bevlkerung lebt deutlich prkerer, Indigenen geht es noch schlechter. Der Staat hlt sich scheinheilig mit Argumenten wie "Indigene Naturvlker inruhe lassen" raus und bietet keine medizinische Grundversorgung. In Kuba kommt es teilweise zu Stromabschaltungen, wenn es aufgrund der Blockade an Kohle mangelt. In Kolumbien leben meiner Meinung nach aber mehr Menschen ohne Infratrukturelle Anschlsse, weil der Staat lndliche Gebiete nicht erschliet und "die freie Marktwirtschaft, Angebot und Nachfrage das schon regeln".

John Bowker and Aaron Rowand lead the team with 9 home runs, but Bowker has been homer less for a month, while Rowand dry spell has lasted two and a half weeks.

I could see arguments that the crime should always be prosecuted at the highest level (federal) or lowest level (city); or that the penalty should be the maximum permitted across all domains where the law was broken, be the minimum, or maybe even be the average. But whatever it is, it should be consistently carried out.

You going to have some abdominal separation during pregnancy   it just the nature of the beast. That said, I honestly don think there is a consensus on how to prevent severe DR because your body mechanics before getting pregnant can impact how far it progresses. It not just one factor. I on my second pregnancy and I pretty sure I developed more severe DR this time around. I got my positive test for this pregnancy just before my son hit 9 months. I did not have lasting DR with my first, but I think general lack of (recovered) core strength after my first pregnancy has contributed to issues this time around, and I have to work harder to recover from any separating.

"At the heart of this whole issue we believe that it's the right thing. We believe that there has been discrimination against us," Rapinoe said. "And while we have fought very hard and for a long time, whether that be through our CBA or through our players association, putting ourselves in the best possible position that we can to get the best deal that we can, we still feel that we don't have what we're trying to achieve, which is equality in the workplace."

No one can tell you how long it will take you to get to a 5:00 mile, if you can at all. It ultimately highly variable based on how committed you are, how much time you have to dedicate, how injury prone you are and if you have enough genetic advantages.

US history seems to have it so that the African American was always one step away from committing a crime to justify riots, lynchings, segregation, arrests, and even disruptions of their family units(causing a rise in urban youth violence as children group up in broken families without sufficient adult guidance).

Scalia showed a deep commitment to originalism, which he later began calling textualism. Judges had a duty to give the same meaning to the Constitution and laws as they had when they were written.

Most chassis ground leads, [a lead connected to the motor frame] are not brought out with the power leads, to avoid confusion] normally the chassis ground is connected to a screw or through bolt, often colored green on the head of the bolt, and away from the terminal block or if in the terminal block positioned in such a manner it does not seem to fall into any possible "pattern" of the power leads. Five lead motors [if ALL ARE WINDING LEADS] are fairly rare and generally special, for example most single phase would be two, three, four, or six, many are four power with one chassis ground. It is important to note that any chassis ground wire needs to be absolutely identified as a chassis ground, [again, from a green screw and or colored green sheath].

But as I stated up top people are dumb, and many have decided to just take a loose battery and throw it in their pocket with change and keys. Well, as with literally any battery, if a conductive point is touching both the positive and negative point, this will cause the battery to begin draining electricity through those items. This can cause a short circuit or over the top stress on the cell, causing the battery to vent/catch fire/expand to a critical point in said idiots pocket.

Money bet at thoroughbred tracks dropped from just over $15 billion in 2003 to less than $11 billion in 2013, according to the Jockey Club, an industry clearinghouse.Though stronger financially than dog racing, horse racing is also far more expensive to stage, and only a handful of the biggest tracks are profitable without casinos to support them.Some within the horse racing industry see decoupling laws as a threat to their own sport."They could set a dangerous precedent for all breeds of racing," said Lonny Powell, the CEO of the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association, who worked for years as a regulator of dog races.Melbourne Greyhound Park, a smaller track in central Florida, sees the biggest crowd each year during the Kentucky Derby, when around 3,000 patrons turn up to watch the simulcast screens and place bets on the horses.Cashing in on those rare events is not enough for track operators. Promotional gimmicks such as "Doggy Dinner Theater" and races with dogs named for celebrities have not worked, said Havenick, the Miami track owner.Reducing the number of races might help make them special events again, he suggested.The death of dog racing would be the end of "a beautiful show," said Duke Adkinson, a longtime fan who came to Flagler   now part of Magic City Casino   with his preteen grandson Dillon to instill in him the love for the races..

As you gain experience and learn your opponents' playing styles and hand selection, you can play a few more starting hands. Hands with an A, 3, and two high cards are often playable as well as hands containing an ace suited to one other card that offer flush and straight possibilities and some low potential, such as A 4 6 7.Beginning Omaha/8 players often overrate pairs, especially pocket aces. Unlike Hold'em, a pair will almost never win a pot.

My advice is simple, if you want to be "pro" just buy the best courses out there. I live a frugal life and in a place where cost of living is low, so short term (next 5 years), I be thrilled with 20k USD per year, long term I want more obviously, but I know that statistically this is an inevitability considering I beat my game of choice at around 19bb/100 and I just started learning PLO with Nandez stuff, so the big time profit will come, just have to keep playing big field tournies and I be binking one one day.

But what if Smith dies at 67? Then his estate/survivor can take advantage of some little known provisions of the OAS Act. His executor can apply to begin Smith OAS pension with the effective starting date set as one year prior to the date of death. Keep in mind that OAS payments always end on death: our concern here is merely the opportunity to collect for the one year prior to death. 
Ok fine, it still leaves 4 or so months to spare. Time passes and nothing, then with 3 months before my trip (which I have already bought my tickets for because I can wait until the last minute because they are expensive enough as it is) my manager says they are denying my vacation because we are short staffed. 
I was speculating last night about how the human consciousness on one hand is getting more and more connected with the spread of the internet but at the same time I feel the internet and millions of sources of "education" means that essentially the reallity bubble/tunnle that we are all living in is getting more and more unique (and lonely) as we are less and less able to interact with eachother on day to day basis because of technology. I can help but think that a family sitting down at dinner not talking because of cellphones and overworked parents and disconnected children is a perfect recepie for a Sweet big brother control scheme where there the grownups are worker bees and the children are initates into a deeper worker bee system..

On Thanksgiving Day, we recall the courageous and inspiring journey of the Pilgrims who, nearly four centuries ago, ventured across the vast ocean to flee religious persecution and establish a home in the New World. They faced illness, harsh conditions, and uncertainty, as they trusted in God for a brighter future. The more than 100 Pilgrims who arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the Mayflower, instilled in our Nation a strong faith in God that continues to be a beacon of hope to all Americans.

You can easily just remove all the comments and then ban all the offending users before the damage is done even if your entire team happens to be online and ready to help. If you think support is readily available from the higher ups, you be wrong as brigading and harassment are both routinely reported and minimally responded to. It a lot of work for the mods to handle when that happens and can take us away from our friends or families or whatever activities we might have otherwise been doing in order to clean up those messes which typically go well beyond the usual amount of activity needed to moderate..

Remember the latest James Bond flick, which I actually labeled a poker movie in an article just recently? Remember that poker game between that Greek guy and Agent 007? The other guy bets his car, sure that he would win. I think it was an Alfa Romeo, I am not sure, my memory is a bit hazy (all I can remember is Daniel Craig as James Bond). Anyhow, Bond wins the hand and the car, of course. Andrei Karpov, from Murmansk, had run out of money in a game of poker and offered his opponent his wife instead of cash to stay in the game.

Actually yes. If an artist sells a painting to someone, they no longer have the right to come back and it years later. In a sense it makes a Banksy 2006, now a Banksy 2018. The exception here I believe is that Sotheby owned the painting, and working with Banksy, they all decided to get in on this, Banksy for the recognition and Sotheby for the increased value. I think thats why they let him into the auction to activate it, why his authentication company was able to switch things out with no one and no cameras noticing, and why it only shredded half way. That way its still the old version with the new. Of course other theories which i also starting to believe state there were probably 2 rollers and one contained pre shredded version. Since he keeps his identity secret he has Pest Control, a small group of people that he trusts with his identity, handle most communication. When some Banksy esque art shows up in a major city Pest Control is the group who confirms that "yeah, this one's by Banksy". From what I can tell it seems like when they heard it was being auctioned Pest Control checked out the painting on behalf of Banksy to make sure everything was in order and simultaneously checked out the frame and replaced any batteries or whatever it needed in it.
These observations indicate that the investigation of neck pain by discography alone or by zygapophysial blocks alone constitutes an inadequate approach to neck pain, which fails to identify the majority of patients whose symptoms stem from multiple elements in the 3 joint complexes of the neck.

Both moves have had their proof from time. On top of that, his exceptional courage in sending a frigate to try to disrupt French nuclear testing at Mururoa has, rightly, gone down in legend.

EDIT: forgot to say but this kind of calculation os obviously too much ingame. Thats why i highly recommend knowing at least how to calculate basic pot odds or just remembering the basic milestones: 1/4 pot bet requires 17%, 1/3 20%, 1/2 25%, 2/3 29% , 3/4 30% and pot sized 33% Equity. A bet into an empty pot 50%. In this case if you remember the milestones you can remember that a 226BB shove into a 41BB pot is somewhat close to a bet into an empty pot, then take away a few percentages since 41BB is still something and give or take guess around 45% equity. Remember though this ONLY works in end of action spots. Dont use this reasoning vs a standard flop CBet or something.

I sorry, but I a disagree. The whole point of the Swiss system is to make sure no one is eliminated early, and also to make people with the same score play each other (winner VS winner, loser VS loser etc).

This is the reason, only professional players play these tournaments and most people like to take part in a free casino tournament.

Nah. There was some of that in the background but in the foreground the respective empires were pursuing their own interests and using the cold war as justification. I let (Wikipedia explain). Foreign Policy, 1945 1954 (1972) has also received considerable attention in the historiography on the Cold War. The Kolkos argued American policy was both reflexively anticommunist and counterrevolutionary. The United States was fighting not necessarily Soviet influence, but also any form of challenge to the American economic and political prerogatives through covert or military means. In this sense, the Cold War is less a story of rivalry between two blocs, but more a story of the ways by which the dominant states within each bloc controlled and disciplined their own populations and clients and about who supported and stood to benefit from increased arms production and political anxiety over a perceived external enemy.

Yes. The general answer is that yes dealers at the WSOP, like many tournaments, do get tips from the players. However, in 2006 the WSOP decided that all tips would be pooled so it is not possible to tip individual dealers anymore. Further to this it may be that younger players, or those with primarily online experience, just don't tip as much all together. I could only rumors of this however, but it would make sense as in online play there is no real dealer, so nobody actually tips. (Full Answer)

The fact that busting out means you lose all of your equity in the prize pool, while doubling up does not double your equity, means that to play for a lot of chips early on, you need to have a big advantage. In Texas hold'em sit and go tournaments such opportunities come up fairly often, such as with having a big pair preflop, or hitting a set on the flop, making a flush, etc. But in Omaha SNG's most hands are only about a 6:5 favorite preflop and even after a favorable flop for your hand has hit your opponents will usually be drawing very live. The result is that you should play very tight early on, even tighter than in hold'em sng tournaments, waiting for only the most absolute premium hands like a pair of aces with a wheel card, or A23x. This can be quite boring and would be easy to take advantage of in a cash game, but is the correct Omaha sng strategy.

Der Zrcher Designer mit argentinischen Wurzeln hat eine Designwelt als Spiegel der Stadt geschaffen: mondn, aber gemtlich, hochwertig, aber verspielt, kultiviert, aber auch kurios. Neben bekannten und neuen Hberli Entwrfen ist das Hotel gespickt mit Liebeserklrungen an die Stadt Zrich.
However, could some of this be because of the medications she's taking? Don't give up on your sister yet. 
If there is demand for it, it happens. Nobody needs to convince anybody. The real problem here is that BTC implementation is overwhelmingly centralized in Bitcoin Core. So a couple of devs who should only been the enabler of the users wish are now in the decision making position. One of them is provably insane, one other is popping champagnes for high fees. This is what the problem is.

Bud Light will print the information on secondary packaging, like the cardboard boxes that house 12 packs, but not on individual cans and bottles.. 
Yesterday, tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of angry white Americans gathered in Washington, DC to show their Obama hating, Glen Beck loving, tea bagging, patriotic selves and no one noticed. It not that no one noticed the protesters, but no one seemed to notice that the crowd was 99.9% white.

4. They Already Talking Up Transformers 2: While the first one isn even out yet, the boy wonder Shia LaBeouf told me that "if" this one makes money (if!), there will be a second one. I mean, obviously, but still good to know they thinking ahead.

It was certainly an evolution over a couple of years. When I first came in, I started asking a lot of questions. So "automated facial coding"   what actually is that? What does that mean? What do we do? You have to ask those basic questions. At one point in time, several people said that we recognize and detect emotions. I thought that sounded simple enough. It was emotion recognition, so why were we calling it facial coding? Then, I spent a lot of time with key stakeholders in the company, including our CEO who was out on the road talking about this new cutting edge technology. We realized that we were doing everything an AI company should be. Our CEO and I came up with EmotionAI in a few minutes before a talk, and it stuck for the first time. It was an "a ha!" moment. It's naming the value prop in a snappy way that people actually recognize and understand.
It seems foolish to make it harder than it already is.

I also really hoped the book would speak to Pkeh about the need to own their history and again the reception has been remarkable. 
Which i could have done from the comfort and cost of my own god damn bed. 
Lady Gaga can singwell, don't get me wrong but Britney does have strong vocals (she'ssinging live now) and is a way better dancer.
