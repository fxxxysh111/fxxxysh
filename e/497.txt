My parents still support him. They would never vote for a Democrat.

2. Focus on your cards and not on your opponents   an example of this common mistake is when a player goes all the way to the river with a pair of aces no matter what. If you have a pair of aces, the flop is Ten of diamond, 8 of diamond and 7 of heart, the turn is 6 of diamond and suddenly a passive player starts betting or raising, most of the chances that your pair is beaten and you should fold. There are so many possible hands that beat you, and you have practically no 'outs' to get.

I recently attended a business communication seminar put on by the local chamber of commerce. The attendees were almost all native Japanese speakers. The teacher said that  is definitely the preferred and polite way to say goodbye in business settings. She said that  is overused and not polite and should only be used as a response to  and only with people in the same group and on the same level, and that  should be used with coworkers who are leaving at the same time or from a different group. (My last company actually made this a rule because the boss hated  and thought it was rude to him personally to use it.) She also said that  is pretty much always rude and especially shouldn't be used towards vendors, delivery people, and others who have a service connection to the company, even though they are technically lower in that situation.  is the proper greeting in that case, too.

There are 7 8 Holland casinos all over NL. Most action for poker is in Ansterdam and Breda. Amsterdam gets a steady flow of tourists and it is soft on most days, especially weekends. On week days, you might find at yourself at a table with regs which is fairly negative ev as far as my level of play is concerned. There are tournaments on almost every day in different locations. Mon/Wed there are tournaments in Utrecht (50km from Amsterdam, a 20minute train ride away), Thursdays in Nijmegen (near the border with Germany)if memory serves me right. On tournament days, there is action on the tables. On other days, at locations other than ansterdam and Breda, there are fewer tables and it difficult to get a seat.
In the past, poker was mainly considered as a game of luck. But for many years, it had been observed that the regular players are winning poker tournaments more often. So it becomes clear that poker is a skill based game which can be learnt.

The mystery has been drawing a moderate amount of attention ever since. Along with Hance and other interested parties, Reddit has been tinkering with the mystery, but to this day there is no conclusive breakthrough. Some say (and Occam's razor strongly suggests) that a local eccentric lawyer, who has allegedly been placing the ads for at least a decade but claims to work for others, is the person behind the "secret society." Others speculate that either Hance is in on the con or this is a wacky long con that members of the university have been keeping up for decades to mess with people, and a bunch of students and professors are having a ball at Hance's expense. As for Hance himself, he claims he has been bombarded with over 100 emails, courier packages, phone messages, and even small donations from the people behind the ads over the years. He seems convinced that the ads are actually communication between members of a possibly vast secret society of intellectual dissidents, and something potentially sinister is at hand.

Back story: In school, I was always extremely studious, and took up going to college and high school, concurrently. Through an agreement between my school and the community college, I began taking true college classes at 14, not dual credit!

Also, people with high sugar diet are the ones prone to stress and depression that eventually results in obesity. 
I stand my point forever that eroges make the best otomes. They are usually long since each route must cover both first the love story and then the "general" story while they are already in an intimate relationship (well, it depends of the game but the good ones are usually like this). These games don end up with a "kiss and hope for more"; these games usually end with a "everything will be alright, and you already saw the prove of it" kind of feeling.
Missing a deadline can be too damaging. 
Yeah, yeah, for some, it will be all hearts and flowers, blah, blah, blah. Well, goody for them. Like that girl who will be staring lovingly into some gorgeous doctor's eyes while he gets down on one knee in front of an expensive restaurant full of approving patrons, and asks for her hand in marriage?

We have been occupied by enemy forces from within and without since that stolen election. They are systematically dismantling our government, our state department has been down to a skeleton crew for the entire two years following Tillerson (Rexxon, the oil guy who was given a "Friend of Russia" medal from Putin) doing his Kremlin duty and firing most of the staff, our public education is being dismantled by dilettante and cult extremist Betsy DeVos, sister of terrorist and fellow extremist Erik Prince.

Basses like a little humidity. If your instrument gets too dried out, like in a really cold place where the heater is constantly blasting, or in a frickin desert, it can make the instrument more prone to little cracks or other damage. 
Could there be a background process that running? Have you checked Task Manager logs during a session? It should record the spike in cpu/gpu/whatever and at least point you in the right direction. It might be an application, task or a cheeky update that triggering it (does it happen at certain times?). For example, I have Flux installed on my PC, whenever it kicks in (evening) if i playing a game it will slow my PC to a crawl for like 10 seconds then everything will be fine again! Just an idea anyway. 
Another thing that you will want to keep an eye out for when you are looking into these online poker strategy and game plays, is whether or not they are out and out poker cheats, or even whether they are borderline poker cheats.

We were basically grounded until the essay was complete and considered good enough. The worse the punishment, the longer the essay and the harder he critiqued it.
The scallops were another standout, perfectly prepared and served with a chunky bed of mashed potatoes and spinach.

The feud was very well received here until the match itself. Long time fan favourite Dean was a cocky face champion with a few heelish mannerisms and Ziggler was a long time fan favourite who been under appreciated for a long time and finally getting a long overdue shot at the title. The build was good, the promos were good. The match failed to deliver for whatever reason and it soured people on Dean reign.

The retro futurism aspects are definitely present in both. Similarities visually probably have to with both respective works approach to worldbuilding which is far more causal and subtle than say something like Game of Thrones (Not to insult GoT, obviously they have introduce the audience to more information). The biggest similarity between the two I think is the semi satirical social aspects in both. For Maniac the most obvious are "Ad Buddies" and "Rent A Friends". His job was literally to make a handwritten letters as gifts because in the future actual writing has become a novelty. I think its stuff like that which stood out to you. at Gwanghwamun Square in the center of Seoul to "campaign to build order in taxi operation business and fight against illegal carpooling."

In all fairness one of my dear friends actually thought she had appendicitis, or a ruptured bowel or something. She was writhing and sobbing on a trolley in the hospital, and she let out the most horrendous fart and immediately felt better. The nurse looking after her fell about laughing and they sent her home shortly afterwards. She reckoned in the end it was too much German rye bread.
Defeating 747 poker players, he owned the title with a grand prize of $1.2 million. 
Perhaps most important of all is the tenuous link between growth and the inflation target. Abe and other LDP leaders argue that by fueling expectations of future higher prices, policymakers can change consumer sentiment, inducing people to make purchases now rather than deferring them as they have been doing for years in the expectation of seeing lower prices in the future.

CEO speaks of 'a sensual experience'
My (supposedly non denominational) officiant was told in no uncertain terms that the brief ceremony was to have no mention of God or religion. She sends me the first draft, several mentions. I edit it and send it back, she says ok, but theres a nice poem that not really religious but I love to read it at ceremonies called in the sand Can we add that. I familiar with the poem. It about God carrying a man through the hard times in his life. I don see how this has anything to do with marriage and I said no. I asked that she instead recite the Dr. Seuss Weirdness poem and she says she edit it in. Day of the ceremony comes, no Dr. Seuss poem, more than one mention of God/blessings, and she stumbled through it like she never read it before. Just awful. I should fired her after she pushed so hard on the God issue when we were negotiating the script.

You do not have to suffer from sinus infection all year round. There are treatments available to ease your sinusitis.

Those dead cells tend to clump together and then   because of natural oils   stick on your head and clothing, refusing to harmlessly drift away. That's the science of the matter; below are some solutions.

There are also "guaranteed" tournaments with fixed prize regardless of the number of players (so you are sure to get minimum prize fund).
There are seven games built into this portable poker game system.

In our country, democratic governments have been no better than dictatorial ones, and things have never been as bad as they are today. The whole nation is cursing the corruption and incapability of the rulers. As far as the "patriotic generals" are concerned, they are truly patriotic only as long as they are at the borders, in their units and in their garrisons. Once they get a taste of luxurious Islamabad living, they change like chameleons. Like civilian leaders, they soon surround themselves with sycophants and come under the illusion that they are know alls. One should not forget that, in a democracy, governance is according to the wishes of the people, while a dictator rules according to his whims.

"I always say the biggest game of the season is the next week," Hopson said. "In football, we count our poker chips up at the end, but this is a big football game. Our kids understand it's a big football game. That's a little plus on the side of this game, but I said it last week that we're in a five game playoff, and now we're down to a four game playoff. That's the reality of where we are as a football team. It's the next one up, and it's the biggest one."

The A380 Jumbo typically costs around $414m per unit. It rises to 80ft in height, has a 21.5ft cabin width on the main deck and 19ft on the upper deck, and has a whopping 261ft wingspan. It can accommodate a maximum of 853 passengers in a single class configuration or, more likely, 644 passengers in a 2 class configuration. The Airbus A380 can reach a maximum speed of 634mph (Mach 0.96) and has a range of 9,755 miles. Some airlines think the A380 is too large and too heavy for their needs, so Airbus are responding by building a lighter version, which has a significantly reduced maximum flying range, but will use much less fuel, making it more economical for airlines to operate.

Sears shuttered their catalog in 1993 (before Amazon even started selling books) because people at the time greatly preferred shopping in the store and Sears had amazing market penetration at an anchor store in virtually every mall and their freestanding Sears Hometown Stores in smaller communities. The catalog wasn a preference, it was a necessity until it stopped competing with the local general store and started competing with the Sears department store.

In different era's there obviously are different violinists who can be considered as the most famous in the world. It's like with music in general that one might like the virtuosity of one performer over the other. I'm to young to have heard all the best violinists in the world, then again I've worked with a lot of world famous violinists during my period in the KCO, and by Jove there are a good few violinists which can get that predicate. Yehudi Menuhin, Jascha Heifetz, Fritz Kreisler, Itzhak Perlman, and many of the 'new' generation violinists like Janine Jansen, Nigel Kennedy, Jaap van Zweden, Maxime Vengerov. Generally Nicollo Paganini is mentioned as the most famous violinist which ever lived, but then again that's hearsay. Certainly Paganini was the most notorious one, the people of his time called him the Devil's violinist maybe for his personal taste to play for the death at graveyards at night. (Full Answer)

Tell me about it my dude. I had the same shit, went to the emergency room with stomach pain and vomiting. Waited nearly 4 hours and then the doctor wanted to send me home with a prescription for antibiotics because he thought it was just a flu. I asked him "what about the stomach pain"? So he begrudgingly decided to press in a few different places on my stomach to see if anything was wrong. When he hit the sweet spot, I screamed, nearly jumped out of the bed I was in, and then threw up in the nearest trashcan. At that point, he decided it was probably worthwhile to get an MRI done.
Sex and intimacy can be great, but you can still have a fulfilling life without them. So if you decide this isn something you want to work through, that okay too. Ideally I would like for you to try because it seems like it important to you, but if you change your mind and feel you don want to or don feel it important enough to put your self through all the anxiety, that okay too. This doesn mean you are hopeless. This just means your path is different. That okay.

Although bad experiences (such as anxiety and agitation) are more common on 25x NBOMe due to adrenergic agonism causing unexpected stimulation, LSD itself binds to both 5 HT2a and D2   meaning it should have a higher risk for psychosis.

My best friend, 20, is a delusional 'artist' who needs to grow up. IMO, a best friend is someone who supports you and puts up with your shit. If you are doing anything that is egregiously bad, they will try to talk some sense into you   but love you through the ups and downs. Your friend is 20. That is a kid. However, you don know their potential and you don know whether they will be successful. It not sunshine and rainbow worlds that make people succeed in an arts based career. Also, pretty much anyone who has ever made it against the odds will tell you that you have to try. I can imagine telling someone to grow up, get real and accept they will never succeed as an artist at 20 years old. If you read up on successful contemporary artists   most did not taste any success until late 20s or 30s. Very few people have even come into their own at 20   they are still finding their "voice". All this aside, why are you so critical of someone who is supposed to be your best friend? This isn your BF or GF or spouse. You are not supporting them financially.

As part of the deal with New York alone, Amazon was to receive an estimated $2.8 billion in tax breaks and other business incentives. That's the equivalent of New York taxpayers paying Amazon $112,000 for each of the 25,000 jobs the tech giant had promised to create at its Long Island City headquarters. (New York offered twice as much in incentives as Virginia did.) But the deal was met with anger and protest from residents. And it appears to have been enough to sway Amazon to kill its planned HQ2 location there.

The opportunistic streak in this new England was now being fully tested. Gerrard and Parker were working another double shift against a mobile and denser Italian midfield.

Okay that's cool, you can get sick of it all you want, but don't be offended at some else's opinion. OP asked a question, and I gave him my totally subjective thoughts. I never said the game wasn't polished. That's not what OP asked. The question was "Is this game worth $60". That's great that you're having a wonderful time, but people are different. I never mentioned anything about the game being an RPG, or "leveling up". the game flat out needs more and that's my opinion, so no need to get your panties in a bunch. all my suggestions were different ammo types, different food types, just more variety to the already established systems. You're just projecting onto my comment. I don't play this game for a RPG experience. It's a sandbox game, plain and simple. And I think it needs more things for variety. Everything you see is the same. No fun in that. oh look a plank, oh look a banana, oh look a chicken. Why can't they flesh out the ship repair system? Maybe add different mechanics of repair? What if the rope would get torn and need replacing, and made a sail unusable? And different melee weapons could be purely play style choice. Doesn't mean one HAS to be better than the other. And that's one small suggestion. They've already implemented this with 3 different gun types. So not sure where this "adding variety will ruin the game" attitude comes from. my quarrels with the game have nothing to do with the genre of game. The game has been basically the same since launch, and the updates they've made have been welcome additions, but nothing has even scratched the surface of the possibilities that could be done in this game.

In particular, on exchanges that favour the maker in price improvement (do the opposite of what I believe Bitmex does), you end up with stupid situations where the price drops 90% because someone accidentally put on a sell order with a missing zero, and the exchange did the trades at the erroneous price instead of walking down the order book from the best (highest) buy price..

Drug addiction doesn't know race, gender, or socioeconomic status. It effects successful professionals as well as the poverty stricken. The fact is, you can't always recognize a drug addict by looking at him. You may not even be able to recognize addiction in yourself. Addiction is something that may happen quickly, but it can also happen gradually over time. This makes recognizing addiction in someone you love, or yourself, that much harder to grasp.

One thing about genestealers being "immune" to warp corruption though. The Warp doesn care about "science".

Killdeer young are able to fly away soon after they are hatched, but there was no way to know whether they would hatch quickly.Killdeer are not considered a species at risk, although their domestic numbers in Canada have been on the decline over the last four decades.Still, moving the nest required federal approval, which arrived ahead of a deadline that would have caused a cascade of construction problems for the 11 day festival, which gets underway next week.Monika Melichar of Woodlands Wildlife Sanctuary in Minden, Ont., some 300 kilometres west of Ottawa, began the painstaking move by placing a replica nest with the eggs inside near the real one.The mother killdeer flew away at first, but returned a short time later, resting on the replica nest."These birds are good   the parents haven't given up yet," Melichar said.She will be moving the nest one metre every 20 minutes until it reaches its new home about 30 metres away from where the stage will be located.But if the mother abandons the eggs, which is a possibility, the eggs will be transported to a facility where they have the best chance of survival.The nest' new home is far enough away that the birds won't be disturbed by the hundreds of thousands of music fans who will trample through the festival grounds to see the likes of Shawn Mendes, Bryan Adams, Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band, among a host of other acts."There was a big learning curve, those of us involved with the festival had to quickly get up to speed on what needed to be done, so certainly it's not something we'd like to go through again," Monahan said.
