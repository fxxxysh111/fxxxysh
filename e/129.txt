While it may feel overwhelming to think about how you might go about rewilding the world, rewilding the land where you live   your town, your neighborhood, maybe even just your own yard   isn't so daunting. Consider starting small: Reforest your yard with local, native trees and vegetation. Just plant trees and other greenery that would naturally grow where you live. Go one more step and work with your neighbors and your community to tie your efforts together. If you and your neighbor both go native with your yards, and you plant back to back, you've just doubled the size of your reforestation efforts.

Are you serious? Republicans shit the bed when a Democrat says a bad word in private, but they can yell "go back to Puerto Rico" to their colleagues while in session. Did you forget that the Republican president tried to deny disaster relief funding and purposefully acted slowly resulting in the current shit show. The democrats visit and suddenly that is a bad thing. They are our countrymen and deserve to be acknowledged. Your inability to see how this is offensive demonstrates your lack of maturity, and I think you should question your own grasp of logic.

It makes us feel comfortable to read an economist predictions on where she thinks the economy will be in a year. If you took economists forecasts for 2007, most would have said the economy would continue to grow at a healthy pace. Well, those forecasts were wrong because the numbers blinded the economists. Focusing on the numbers is great for the short term, but you have to understand the factors that drive the underlying economy. Those can be determined by starting at an Excel spreadsheet. One must be active in the market, speak to people who have first hand knowledge of what drives an industry, and see what other veterans in the market think. A mixture of understanding the numbers and what drives the numbers provides us with a complete view of what happening in the economy.

Athletics as a whole are a positive outlet that teaches many cooperative skills. There are a few crazies among sports parents that would lend themselves to an apt comparison, but there is little of real value in beauty pageants on the whole. They are explicitly the valuation of physical beauty in a competitive environment.

So I think it great that you backing up the school with a reasonable consequence at home. Tech time out and early bedtime for a week seems appropriate vs if you were grounding him for a month. IMO your son will more vividly remember getting in extra trouble at home vs the other kids whose parents think it solely the school responsibility to deal with it. I also talk with him about using common sense and making good decisions, though.

But isn't describing the surface of female politicians their hair, their clothes, their shoes just another way of minimizing the content of their ideas? And isn't that part of a larger misogyny? Everyone hates Dick Cheney because he's evil, but he's evil based on what he says. People hate Sarah Palin in a more personal way, because she's pretty and stupid and homey and conservative perhaps, just as people hated Hilary Clinton before Barack put her somewhere safe because she didn't care about pretty, wouldn't bake cookies, and she's smart.

Somebody had executed both men. My grandfather said his captain was furious, and was determined to discover who did it but there were no witnesses. The rumors pointed to a new lieutenant in their unit who had been nearby. The same man died in the Korean conflict years later, and my grandfather decided he earned an early trip to hell for the crime. It was a haunting event for a close knit unit who had grown to mostly trust and respect one another.

Yeah, it's a very difficult topic. It sounds counter intuitive but the bullfighting breed of cattle actually lives one of the most "free in the wild" kind of life. Only a small percentage actually get to a bullfighting ring (I think it was 1/6, 1/60, don't remember honestly), while most of them (all the females to begin with) never do, and they live a very free and open range kind of life, secluded from contact with humans and living very well. Compared to industry breeding of cattle for meat and milk, they truly live a privileged life. And in places where bullfighting is banned, well guess what happens to all those animals, straight to the slaughterhouse.

Metal detectors can penetrate the earth and detect an object down to about one foot under the surface. Just how far each machine can penetrate is determined by the type of metal or mineral you are trying to locate, the size and density of the target, the composition of the soil and the quality of the detector. Soil which contains a high concentration of minerals can cause interference and will reduce depth penetration..

Ok but what if you get a remote speaker and set it to play some preset audio files at random times. Hide it in your city at very difficult to find places and if the cops don find it, move it every few days to different locations and hide it again.

Doyle was a promising basketball player and runner in his youth but a leg injury ended any possibility of a career on the courts or athletics' tracks. After briefly flirting with a job as a salesman, Doyle found that he could make far more money playing cards and turned to poker for a full time income. He teamed up with other rounders including Amarillo Slim, and they pooled their resources and toured Texas looking for action.

To play Texas hold em and win, you need to make the best hand possible out of your hand. The two cards you receive at the beginning, and the community cards, will help you make the best hands. While you play, you can bet on how well your hand is, if you think you have the highest hand.

I think we should find a way to make oil refining and usage pollute a lot less and use it for things that specifically need it such as plastics and other petrochemical byproducts but should switch over to renewables that would make a marginal difference when done on a massive scale such as cars. I dont see why we cant have the best of both worlds. What will we do with all the oil laying underwater/underground if we switch to 100% renewables right now? As far as I know, oil when processed, is a greatly efficient fuel. It can be stored easily with minimal decay and produces massive amounts of energy when burnt. Think of it like a videogame. Would you not harvest all the possible resources to gain an advantage if your opponent does it as well or would you willingly handicap yourself by not using this resource?
As a consequence of his mother making a deal with Azazel (she was young, and she needed the money!) Sam was infected with demon blood when only six months old.

I believe that requirements for personhood must be non arbitrary (something arbitrary cannot be used to decide whether people can be killed), consistent (viability, for instance, changes based on location and time period, and I don believe that it makes logical sense for the value of human life to change over time and/or location), and must not also exclude born humans (consciousness/sentience is lost while in a coma, but if it were guaranteed that the coma patient would awake in 9 months, they would still possess their rights). The only conditions I found that do not break these rules are that it be alive, a separate organism, and possess human DNA.

She has run a technocratic campaign, focusing on education and tax policy. But she loses her cool when she talks about EKRE, Estonia's anti immigrant, Eurosceptic populist party. "They want to destroy everything," she says: all the institutions that have made her open, tech savvy nation more successful than "other countries that had the same starting point. Take Moldova, for example."

Nevermo here. My best friend is ex mormon (one of the reasons I here), she STILL believes that oral sex is sinful. Out of nowhere one day, she started spouting off all of this Mormon propaganda. I said absolutely nothing, no response at all. Because, I know better, another day when she in a better place I will bring up the subject. We been through this kind of thing before. Time and distance does a lot by itself to disabuse her of these dangerous beliefs (more like superstition) but waiting for the right time to educate and inform is best. It thoroughly amazes me the lies she continued to believe long after she quit the cult, the indoctrination is so ingrained, it is very, very difficult to beat.

There are other atomic conjoined terms in this book besides "bomb", and they are somewhat telling of the period.

So I definitely think I butchered this hand. Looking back, his pre flop play left him uncapped, so there's no reason for me to not fear AK, AQ, or AA on this board. In fact, his lead on the turn probably discounts hands like JJ/TT, as the A didn't scare him off of those.

Because the start of your commute is a place of your choosing. This sounds like you are advocating for paying employees differently for a factor that has nothing to do with their job experience or performance, which is inherently discriminatory.

Let look at the top charge. We can calculate the two net forces on this charge, which is k(2.52 )/0.1502 (note that you need to convert units, because k is usually given forCoulumbs, not microCoulumbs and). These two forces are in the direction drawn from the other charges to the top charge (they have the same sign on the charge, so the force is pushing the top charge away).

Hottest tip of the week so far has been the infamous cryptocurrency exchange lockdown; apparently the owner turned up "6 feet under" during a nice vacation, and locked up 200 million worth of crypto, all because he was the sole carrier of a vital password. I cracked many a bank account, and many safe deposit boxes, but this is the first time I tried breaking an online exchange. To be fair, it not that all different from your typical online hack, but the caveat is that every other so called "treasure hunter" is gunning after that password as well. I laugh at their vain attempts; shy from someone firing up an IMB supercomputer there no way any rig is outgunning my own. $10.000 in pure compute hardware, with the world finest hand coded tried and proven programs installed and running.
It unfortunately so true. Why should they invest anymore resources into a game on a decline especially going into its third year when they can just release another sports game or call of duty every single year, charge $80+ for it and include micro transactions?

The Ontario Chamber of Commerce reports that Canadians create new firms at a higher per capita rate than Americans.

Enabling more scale ups is essential to enhancing Canadian prosperity.

The bad news again, though, is that it doesn seem to attack the motor neurons in humans. That would tend to indicate that the paralysis is entirely pain driven. So it very likely that the spider is in unbelievable agony for the few weeks that it takes the larva to eat it.

This is important. I feel like there is a lot of trash talk in the gun community about people reaching out to the Dem side especially when it comes to manufacturer lobbying and contribution efforts. This should be a non partisan issue. Hammer home the fact that anti gun legislation can often be classist and racist.

Antonyan estimated that the game of poker is "90% simple math/general strategy, and 10% understanding the dynamics of the table and/or the attitudes of one or more players towards you as they develop."

Sorry to hear about your disappointing experience. I was at a show where Godsmack opened for Metallica. Someone my ex in laws knew was an equipment truck driver for the tour and got front row in the stands tickets for us. We were right behind the guy with the soundboard (there was a floor seating area between the stands and the stage) and his small area was roped off. After Godsmack set, Sully and some other folks came out and stood in the roped off area just before Metallica came on. I leaned over the railing and tapped Sully on the shoulder with the program and when he turned around I had a Sharpie in the other hand and asked if he would sign the program for my Son who was away from his seat at the time and he did. I was so happy to give him that as a surprise when he returned that I tapped Sully again to thank him and say "this is my Son" (kind of pushing it I know) and he looked at him, nodded and smiled, and turned back around. He and his friends stood there for most of the show so I got that as a bonus, which was nice.

And there, in the dim light of the Foster Street el stop, I kissed her for the very first time.

I ask her about the mustard colored house I saw, and she says, "Oh that one is for sale by owner, we don't buy from individuals if we don't have to."

With 450,000 Australians playing the game (or sport) each week, however, it probably time to give poker a solid definition in an era when newspapers are battling to lure more readers.

While he was a dangerous man with a gun, as well as with the long, bladed knife he carried, Doc was also famed as a gambler. In addition to playing cards for money, he was also a dealer for both Poker and Faro. The best way to represent this unusual cadre of skills is to start Doc off with the Maverick archetype of the gunslinger. Mavericks lose out on Gunslinger's Dodge, Pistol Whip, and Gunslinger's Initiative, but instead they gain Stacked Deck (allowing them to gain bonuses on Bluff, Profession (Gambler), and Sleight of Hand checks), Fist Fighter (treated as having Improved Unarmed Strike as long as they have 1 grit point left), and Gun Twirl (gaining the Dazzling Display feat, and being able to use it with any firearms even without having Weapon Focus as long as he still has 1 grit point left).

Disagree. Big self titled fan over here and The Colour In Anything puts me to sleep. Self titled is half as long, and the songs themselves are a minute shorter on average than on The Colour in Anything. The songs feel more diverse on the self titled, the production sounds more up front and full. Colour is much spacier, quieter. The songwriting is also kind of predictable: we start in a sparse echoey place with his voice, some drums, probably a piano, and then build up to an underwhelming crescendo. It too quiet and empty and the parts that feel like they supposed to stun me do anything but. Now this is just my opinion, of course.

Edit. This isn an uncommon thing. There are really 3 types of homeless: ones with mental/physical disability, ones that are addicts, and ones that literally just had life deal them a shit hand.

That not a fair comparison.

John Abernethy, the NSW coroner, is grey haired and gravel voiced, a phlegmatic character whose career has included the inquest into the deaths of six sailors in the 1998 Sydney to Hobart yacht race and co ordinating the identification and return of bodies after the 2002 Bali bombings. "I have been on this bench 21 years," he says early in the inquiry into the disappearance of Tegan Lane, "and nothing surprises me or bothers me now." But in the days to come, Abernethy world weary air gives way to something like incredulity. The more evidence he hears, the more baffled he seems to become.
