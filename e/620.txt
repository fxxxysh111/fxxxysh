In a tournament situation, frequently by the time you get to a heads up situation pre flop, the blinds are so large that the only decision to make is whether or not to go all in. If the blinds are still relatively small, pre flop play is not all that different from normal, but you may want to be a little more aggresive and try to steal more blinds. Position plays in a heads up situation becomes more complex later in the hand..

This cycle would repeat until there are about 100 men under 18 and 400 500 men over 18, with women staying at 1500. So the ratio would just by pure demographics start to shift towards men, which would put even more stress on the birth rate since you have to kill off an ever increasing number of men. If you did however start to kill off more and more unborn penis having fetuses, you eventually end up with the average age of men increasing by an incredibly amount since each generation has less and less men. So ironically, men would die out first.

There are people on the zc forums that boast about eating 4000 calories in one sitting and not gaining (from my calculations their calorie estimates always seems inaccurately high, for instance 3 lbs of medium ground beef is about 3400 cal.

HOWEVER, there are far more men in higher positions compared to women. Women tend to flood entry level positions and not move up due to various reasons. THIS is where the wage gap occurs. What you see in the media is a statistical misinterpretation of this phenomenon. Additionally, it shows us that there is still a huge issue. Why are men more likely to be an executive? Why aren't women moving up? Signs point to it being a combination of sexism AND cultural norms. Additionally, child rearing is sure to play a role as many women drop out of the workforce, which also affects results.

First off, you're arguing against the overstatement so use salt. there's no argument happening around the erasure of genocides in asia and africa or elsewhere. but if you list all the documented systematic rapes, wars, famines, genocides, blah blah blah europeans fucking take the cake. they colonized most the goddamn world through genocide and slavery. yes other countries and cultures have done this. but there's a reason the world is the way it is now and that has largely to do with empire, settler colonialism in the americas, colonization of asia and africa by white countries, the legacy of the trans atlantic slave trade, capitalism "and sho on and sho forth (zizek nose pinch emoji)"

Captain Marvel opens in outer space, where we're given a quick primer on the Kree/Skrull war, a conflict between the peace loving, heroic Kree and the villainous, shape shifting Skrulls. The title character, although not Kree by birth, is fighting on the Kree side along with Yon Rogg and his team. Her fists can launch explosive bursts of energy but she has been taught to use their power only in extreme circumstances. She has no memory prior to her arrival on the Kree homeworld six years ago but dreams offer her glimpses of her past. After escaping a Skrull trap, Carol comes to Earth, where she meets Nick Fury, rediscovers things about the person she was, learns clues about her destiny, and uncovers hidden truths about the war in which she has been embroiled. In the process, she finds an ally in one she called an enemy (Ben Mendelsohn) and a possible enemy in one she called an ally.

To answer your question, the AI is programmed to bring a teammate towards the ball when you trapped during a double team. It happens a few seconds after you double teamed so you have time to escape; if you don escape, the AI brings a player you can pass the ball to. The issue here is that, since you dribble away from the double team, you don actually get trapped til you on the baseline. So when the AI brings the player (Ferrell) over to help, he has to go right into the paint, where Nance defender is. So 2k algorithm worked, it just was applied probably when it didn need to be.

For Italian food, personally, I think lygon st is a bit of a trap. There is atmosphere and its a classic melbourne area, and some of the restaurants are great. But some are dreadful, so beware.

Otherwise, an absolute institution of melbourne is pelligrinis on Bourke st. Another great place to explore there are the lanes between those two restaurants.

Some good advice above. Although I would say that the reasons behind all your symptoms can be many and varied. Increase in intensity can be one, tight lateral leg structures (ITB) can be another, poor saddle to pedal axle relationship meaning you are using smaller weaker muscles instead of prime movers etc etc. as for your back pain, riding position will be very rider specific so be careful of making broad changes.

There is such variation in peoples spinal posture and deep core muscle control that there is no hard and fast rule for what might be right for you.

Each character is completely relatable to someone, and watching them overcome their flaws, or learn to how to deal with them when they become an issue, is likely to compel the audience to be introspective. Robin needs to learn to be vulnerable and depend on people in a healthy way, Lily and Marshall showcase the struggles of finding "the one" so young that you haven't found yourself yet, and Barney is everything wrong with hook up culture. I wish Ted had let go of Robin, and Robin and Barney had stayed together.

These promises of democracy sound quaint these days in the US, with a populace so uninformed that they are easily misled by demagogues and charlatans into acting in the most undemocratic of ways. what is to blame for the breakdown of civility and citizenship in America? like to blame it all on Fox News and the likes of Glenn Beck and Rush LImbaugh, but the truth is erosion of American democracy predates the appearance of fascism. the Undemocratic began with the destruction of equal opportunity that was contained in the educational system. the 20th century progressed, education became the engine of American democracy. children and young people out of factories and mandating public high school educations lifted an entire generation of Americans out of sweatshop labor. World War II, the GI Bill sent tens of thousands of working men into universities. the 1970s, the American educational system was increasingly open to women and/or Black and Latino Americans.

It still has some significant glitches/issues but it sounds far better than my initial series of attempts at filtering the 2ch version before I realized I had the 5.1 audio and moved to that. I haven tried running audio ID against the newest sanitized versions but I doubt it produce anything better at this point..

(Presidents usually do the precise opposite: they struggle to avoid any appearance of disunity.) This is a breathtaking gamble, and the question arises: Is it witting or not? Is the Administration's disdain for diplomatic precedent a strategy a conscious effort to challenge the institutions and arrangements of the past 50 years or merely a matter of presidential pique?

For some ChIP seq examples, some transcriptional activators and repressors work by binding near gene promoters and interacting with the transcriptional machinery there directly. Because of this, you would tend to annotate these proteins in relation to transcription start sites. On the other hand, there are certain proteins you would expect to be over gene bodies. These would include proteins like the RNA polymerase, and certain histone modifying enzymes (and the marks they themselves modify). There are other proteins whose expected regions of binding are a little less well defined in relations to genes. These could include proteins that bind to enhancers, and other proteins involved in 3D chromatin architecture, such as cohesin and CTCF. It may not necessarily be informative to annotate these naively in relation to gene features, but rather other higher order DNA architecture annotations would be better instead.

Switching from Clarinet to SaxophoneMany beginning students who want to play saxophone are instructed to begin on clarinet, because clarinet was thought a better all around instrument than sax: it was more intellectual (that is, classical) and offered more of a 'challenge'. The saxophone was originally reserved just for people who couldn't succeed on clarinet (which is more difficult to learn the fingerings for).
