Gambling losses are also disproportionately felt in our least affluent postcodes. Why? Because poker machine locations deliberately target these communities. For example, Geelong has the most pokies and poker machine venues of any Victorian council. For the past 10 consecutive months, losses in Geelong have risen compared to monthly losses recorded for the previous two years. In August alone, losses rose almost 10 per cent and are set to hit a record high of $120 million in 2018.

That approach to games is why they make some of the best games out there. It also the same approach that has created a situation where Ubisoft has made a better Mario RPG than Nintendo has in the past decade, and it also looks like Ubisoft is about to make a better Star Fox game than Nintendo is willing to (they didn even make SF: Zero, they outsourced that to Platinum Games). But in terms of hardware, that what lead to the manufactured scarcity, because Nintendo does think of themselves as a toymaker, not a video game publisher/developer.

I think the concept is a tad flawed. If the 25 bounty is added to the prize pool, the 25 you earned from getting the bounty is essential split between the first 3 prizes. So even if you went on to win the tournament, you still wouldn receive the full amount per bounty. I suppose you could argue that the added chips help you throughout the tournament, but you still wouldn receive the full 25 from the bounty. I not sure if the added chips would add up to help ICM wise for the bounty/payout amounts. Hopefully that made sense

Personally, if one of my children slaughtered my grandchildren and daughter in law I think my initial reaction would be something like "wait this can't be right, what really happened" but then after processing I'd be horrified and probably feel a sense of responsibility myself. What I think is extremely upsetting is the way they are quick to paint Shanann as the catalyst. CWs dad even did that in the first interrogation by suggesting SW did something to the kids. So I guess at first I can almost understand the denial but not after you've had time to process.

The phenomenal increases in its value are likely to be free from capital gains tax.

Absolutely. The judge sounded like he was doing his damndest to keep Manafort as happy as possible. The sentence was a joke. Manafort asked the judge if he could force the next judge to have her sentence run at the same time as his, and the judge basically said I don't think I have that power but if you find otherwise let me know. What is that shit!? He was hard nosed to the Mueller team, and soft as can be with the Manafort team. Manafort has lived a vile life of greed, drugging and gang raping his wife, having people killed and fucking with the power balance against the best interest of the people of his own god damn nation.

Sorry to hear the struggle you're facing. There is a lot good advice in this thread but it can be overwhelming to listen to any good advice when you are 'inside' the situation. I mean that as you're going through this it's natural to feel cynical about the advice and think that it's easy to say something and difficult to do it. So the first thing I say you do is recognize this and know that you may feel this way. Once you do that it would be easier to sift through the great advice you're getting here and follow something that makes sense to you.

So, why didn longships have "roofs" or shelters? The main reason is that they weren really built for very long voyages, but rather for raiding or short sailing voyages that might last a few days or a few weeks. It quite possible to be totally fine in an open boat for a limited amount of time at sea, and the "ships" really were more like boats, placing a premium on shallow draft so they could penetrate up rivers and creeks. They were also surprisingly small compared to modern ships, and were built using clinker construction, meaning that they did not have internal ribs or frames on which to hang decks (those were added later).
If you're reading this, however, there's a good chance that you're a parent holding a screaming baby and that you just really, really, want to know what's causing your baby's torment.

Be involved in the bidding: You see it all the time in auction: A player goes for well below the value he's expected to go for. Staying involved in the action has two advantages. First, it allows you the possibility of getting a great value when the crickets come early. In a 12 team league, 276 players will be put up for auction. As such, lightning only needs to strike less than 0.4 percent of the time to make it worth your while. Second, getting involved often (not every time of course) allows you to stay sharp. It is similar to fielders who stay sharp when the pitcher works fast as opposed to those who lose focus when the pitcher takes a long time between pitches.

What consumers don understand is that the vendors are funding these insane return policies. Wal Mart, Costco, home depot, Lowe etc. claim the legal limit of damage on almost every shipment from vendors essentially taking a 10% discount each time.

Now as a dtc manufacturer I have to basically mimick those same return policies regardless of the stupidity and lack of logic in the reasons. Thanks to a small percentage of people who try to take advantage or rip off of a small business you are not crafty or smart just a jerk, but that the culture we created on all sides.

Online poker can be sustained simply because fish lose money too quickly when the skill disparity is so great, especially at higher limits. Networks have to essentially make it impossible for professionals to make money in order to keep their business alive. The longer that people can play and the more variance the network can introduce into the game, the longer the network can collect rake. There was no rhyme or reason to it. They would bet 2/3 pot because that the size all the good players use so we should all use it! Players didn care whether the flop was 522r, A22, 789hhh, etc. 2/3 pot cbet. Cbetting close to 100% was all the rage and was expected to take down the pot a fair bit of the time. 3 betting was almost unheard of unless you had QQ+. If any of this sounds familiar, it should, because this is pretty much how live play is currently; even all the way up to 5/10 there are players like that.

Eventually someone mentioned blow drying and curling their hair, and I was like "what? Every day?" And that's when I realized most of those sleek glossy ladies heat style their hair every goddamn day.

Maybe. (he would have been 16 she 20). A "few" kids you might say to conceal identity or if it just wasn that important to the story. But as a 26 year old having done IVF and been the victim of a terrorist attack, to have adopted 2 or 3 children in this time would have been a major undertaking, not a footnote.

History has shown, Hufbauer says, that "successive Mexican governments   including those of [presidents] Zedillo, Fox, and Pena Nieto   do retaliate." For example, although the charter of the NAFTA established a schedule that would have opened the border states of the United States to competition from Mexican trucking companies in 1995, and all of the United States to this competition in 2000, the full implementation of these provisions was delayed due to concerns about the safety of Mexican trucks and drivers. The delay resulted in much frustration for Mexico, which ultimately implemented retaliatory tariffs on products imported from the United States.

You might not have been able to use your mortgage interest. The standard deduction jumped to 12,000 this year (24,000 if married). So, unless your mortgage interest, state taxes paid, and donations were more than 12,000, your mortgage interest will have no bearing on your return. Plus, the state tax deduction is capped at 10,000 this year. Although the standard deduction was raised, the personal exemption of around 4,000 (8,000 if married) was eliminated. If your itemized deductions were 10,000 last year, you would deduction a total of 14,000 while this year you only deduct 12,000.

Pre fine. Bet bigger flop, id go 50 60 here. There are a ton of hands you are ahead of that you can get value and most of the hands that are ahead of you are going to raise this flop bet especially multi way which makes for a relatively easy fold. As played fold to the raise for the same reason. Flatting the cr is probably the worst option as a shove will fold out some hands that beat you (10 or j and also get value from some combos you are ahead of. Lastly your rational for calling the cr is bad as there are literally NO turn blanks for your hand. You are either going to spike a 9, a draw will complete, or an over will come. 3 points  submitted 11 days ago

Besides, being a little nervous can help you stay focused during a long grind as long as you keep paying attention to all of the variables at the tables.2500 break even hands is nothing, many long time grinders have had 100k break even stretches but those are more common at higher stakes because edges are much smaller there usually.The biggest thing is try not to be so results oriented. It takes a huge sample size just to get a feel for everything.Hopefully they structure everything in such a way that they can best show it off as a skill game, rather than just pure gambling.
