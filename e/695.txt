Every nuclear scientist knows that nuclear world war 3 and its aftermath nuclear winter then ultraviolet summer will have no survivors and Nostradmus' third anti Christ thinks that by triggering nuclear world war 3 the Muslims will survive and own the world. Thanks to George Bush's attempt to conquer the Middle East's oil, and conquer the world for Christianity, if the United States were to leave Iraq now, two thirds of the world's oil would fall into the hands of Nostradamus' Third Anti Christ. With this money, the Anti Christ would have no problem purchasing more nuclear reactors from Russia like the one in Bushehr, Iran, and shiploads of nuclear weapons from North Korea. He could pay every Shiite huge salaries to conquer Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. An even worse scenario for the United States would be if all of the Muslim countries united and turned on the United States.

Hi, actually most trails are not "boardwalks." I guess the picture I linked there is a bit misleading because it is not representative of the entire park, but just a part. But, you find that stairs and associated platforms are sometimes put in where there are especially steep areas   for safety reasons and convenience I guess. In some places, without the stairs, you would have to scale boulders and sheer rock faces. Hiking is such a big activity in Korea that I guess the stairs are put in to make the areas more accessible to a wider range of people. Whether or not that is a good idea or is an eyesore is questionable though.

Then go from there. She may have some explanation you think is reasonable, but still check back in at a later time and see if things have changed.

Ce qui rend difficile l d plante  travers de telles dnominations, c qu mme nom peut tre attribu  plusieurs plantes diffrentes. C ainsi le cas de l de la sauge et de la verveine (toutes trois officinales) qui rpondent au substantif d sacre!

Playing devil's advocate here for a minute, let just suppose that online gambling is indeed the public menace that Interactive Gambling Act advocates are painting it out to be. Why then is it the sole target of the new legislation, while sports betting operators are seemingly allowed to carry out their activities without fear of legal consequences? Doesn that seem just a little bit one sided and contradictory?.

First, it is a daily. You say BB was one of the tighter but you say the table was crazy loose so I won put too much stock in that. In this spot, in a daily tourney, I am 4 bet/calling in this spot. First you do have 2 blockers to AA/KK so the odds are less likely he has that. Second, if BB is thinking at all he knows the 2 callers in between you are crazy loose and this is the perfect spot for a squeeze. You raised BIG, so odds are you have something you do not want to go multi way with. If he gets you to fold then odds are he can get 1 of the 2 of them to fold or both. As played, it is 18k to win a 75k pot and it is a daily so the structure probably is fast paced. Call.

Similarly if you lose your graph will go down by $100 and your winrate will adjust.
For instance, when looking at this wikipedia list of serial killers by country, the earliest serial killer for India is listed as (ca 1765 1840), which is pretty early, but the next ones listed aren even born until the 1950s, whereas for the United States there are cases from the 1790s consistently through to the current day. Also, I can tell since I don have access to my originally cited table dataset, but if unidentified serial killers are included in their count then it entirely possible that if the United States puts more resources into the investigation of serial killers that they would identify more cases where they have serial killers that they haven identified, adding extra padding to their statistic.

Trigger points are still relatively misunderstood but the theory is that in certain areas of muscles around the body, a small part of the muscle can become hyperactive through its innervation and form a taut band of tissue within the muscle. They can be latent, where they don produce any symptoms or they can be active and produce pain, tightness and sometimes referred pain elsewhere.

22, detectives spoke to the 16 year old and his legal guardian, after reading the boy his Miranda rights, according to the affidavit.Collins, in the interview, admitted to picking up a stick, but told investigators he didn't remember what happened after that until he saw Kulpa on the ground and thought, "Oh (expletive)."When asked by a detective how hard he hit Kulpa, on a scale of one to 10, Collins replied, "A six or something; I wanted to knock her out," adding that he did not want to kill her.According to the affidavit, Collins told investigators it was Montgomery's idea to attack Kulpa, and that Montgomery had said, "Let's kill her and take her car." Collins told investigators he chose to use a "blunt object" instead of the axes that were nearby.Collins added that he was "really, really drunk," and that Kulpa "gave me a lot of alcohol and I was stoned as hell." He also said she was hitting on him and was making him uncomfortable, according to the affidavit.But Collins also said, "I shouldn't have done it anyway," and added that, "I did think she was dead," according to the affidavit.Collins told investigators he only struck Kulpa once, although they noted, in the affidavit, that the woman "suffered two very serious injuries to her head."In a short interview at the hospital, Kulpa told investigators she did not remember the assault, only that she had picked up Collins and his friends while they were hitchhiking.While Collins is a juvenile, the Boulder County District Attorney's Office took the rare step of charging him as an adult.Berkenkotter initially prohibited prosecutors from publicly revealing what charges they filed against Collins because the proceedings in the case are temporarily under seal while she considers a defense motion to permanently seal all documents in the case.On Monday, though, District Attorney Stan Garnett released the charges his office filed last week: attempted first degree murder, first degree assault on an at risk person, and two crime of violence sentence enhancers.Collins could face eight to 24 years in prison on the attempted murder charge and 16 to 32 years in prison on the at risk assault charge, Garnett said.The teen remains in custody on $1 million bond and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in February.

The big stacks of chips represent big money, but money itself, an onlooker begins to understand, is almost without psychological weight to the top players. Eric Drache, who runs the cardroom at the fancy new Mirage casino here, was offered a job once when he was a full time card player. He had to ask a civilian friend whether $150,000 was a good year's salary. It didn't sound like much to a man who was usually up or down more than that after an evening's play. Unofficial side games here routinely slosh with more money than the World Series itself. Hundred dollar bills are banded in sheaves of 50; and sheaves are wadded in stacks of ten; and bets and raises hit the table hard, thud thud thud.

Basically, I go through all historical games whether there is a line for it or not, and do a backtest prediction and add the result to the distribution of that prediction.

Later during live betting, when I have a prediction of 145 and the line is 149, then it basic math to calculate the edge given the distribution of 145 predictions.

Gjallarhorn is in essence a military dictatorship, and like most dictatorships they adapt to using whatever schemes they need to be able to control the population under them regardless of the usual morality of it.

For example, a tournament might start with the blinds at 25 50, and progress to 50 100, 75 150, 100 200, 200 400, and so forth. The fact that blinds escalate during a tournament and there are only a set number of chips in play makes tournament play somewhat different than live game play.

We were in a really long hallway with concrete floors and cinder block walls, lit only by our flashlights. At least we were towards the end of the hallway and we could see the wall at our backs. At this point, I started to get really scared. Me and another guy said that we didn want to go down that hallway. Jim said, "what, do you think there are ghosts here?" and I said that there might be. Jim yells down that hallway, "IF THERE ARE ANY GHOSTS HERE, DO NOT FUCK WITH US." This made me really pissed off, and I asked him what the fuck he was trying to do to us. The other guys were really scared too, but Jim laughed at us and said that there aren any ghosts here and started walking down the hallway. We were pissed and scared but we kept going because who wants to be the first to bitch out when you 17 and abandoning creepy abandoned psych hospitals with your friends? We went into some rooms that had a bunch of old disgusting linens and mice in them, but then we eventually got into the morgue.

Still do it. No matter how much I want to avoid it, or if I too tired, etc., I plan for extra time to wash and dry my sheets, or have a perfectly clean set ready and waiting, and the last thing you do before you leave on a trip, vacation, weekend away   is make up your own bed with fresh sheets and make it as neat and tidy as possible.

The bard stumbles upon the sleeping ogre. She tries to wake it, and it brushes her away like a fly. She tries again, and it wakes up in a grumpy mood. She gets not ten seconds into her well rehearsed "I a lost little ogre, please help me" routine before the ogre patience runs out, it tries to eat her, she dodges, and proceeds to run like hell. The groggy ogre lumbers after her, smashing his way around. As the bard nears the mouth of the cave the party hears shouting from the bard and see a "baby ogre" tearing ass out of the cave, wailing and hollering the whole time.

Panel chairman John Walford told the 44 year old he should have reported the racial taunts to match officials, and said he gave them little weight when considering the sentence as they had not been relayed to the referee.

I not gonna downvote you because maybe English isn your first language. But the dialogue in the picture does not actually say that the key opens all locks. The phrase "all sorts of" means various kinds, a variety of types of something. It a common English expression, and I guess it is pretty confusing because of the use of the word "all". It implies that all kinds of lock can be opened, such as door locks, treasure chest locks, gate locks, secret tunnel locks, whatever. But, not necessarily every single door lock or every single treasure chest lock that exists.

In the next 30 years, he was implicated in some 12 murders, either by his own hand, or via hired killers. This sounds a little far fetched, but it's true, he admitted so frequently, and it is a matter of record. In fact he was twice convicted of murder. One enemy of Benny's, Herbert Noble, survived no less than 12 murder attempts by Benny and his henchman, including one occasion when Mrs Noble was blown to smithereens one day when she borrowed Herbert's car and it exploded when she turned the ignition key. Right car, wrong victim. Herbert was eventually murdered when his car was blown up a few years later.

Middels het uitvoeren van een neurologisch en functioneel actief onderzoek bij een patint met MS heb ik de juiste informatie kunnen verkrijgen. Met deze informatie kon ik de fysiotherapeutische diagnosen stellen en op basis daarvan een behandelplan opstellen. De docent heeft middels het beoordelingsformulier het onderdeel onderzoeken ruim voldoende beoordeel. De docent heeft aangegeven dat het onderzoek goed en nauwkeurig is uitgevoerd.

This is probably the biggest way in which "The Grand" differs from other mockumentaries, which usually just go for laughs or drama, but not both (the exception being The UK Office, which should be required watching for everybody). The laughs are aplenty, but director Zak Penn doesn't just use the actors as a vessel through which to deliver comedy; he constructs them as fleshed out, believable human beings, and when genuine drama arises between them, he isn't afraid to look it in the eye and deal with it maturely.

I was fortunate enough to finally see a restored version on TCM back in October. The literal freak show aspect aside, it's a very entertaining thriller/horror film that has more heart than it should. For being made in a time period that was very discriminatory towards a lot of people who didn't conform to the norm, it had a pretty positive message about acceptance of others who are different that didn't feel tacked on or was only there to justify the film..

It might not involve a TV or a bar, but anyplace you go to be alone can technically be defined as a man cave. And there's no reason that a home office has to be a dull, sterile place. A TV may not be appropriate if you actually have to work there, but invest in a comfy leather chair, install relaxing lighting and surround yourself with memorabilia. Make it a room you like to visit instead of somewhere you have to go.

, which allows poker rooms and other locations to host charity poker games seven days a week as long as no more than four charities hold events at the same location at the same time. The bill also would increase the daily limit for chip sales per charity from $15,000 to $20,000, with the ability to go as high as $50,000 if charities furnish and run the games themselves instead of hiring a licensed supplier. Bill sponsor Sen. Rick Jones (R Grand Ledge) said he got calls from charities from all over Michigan who asked for a solution that protects their source of fundraising. Those charities are now focusing on convincing members of the House to do the same. "The profitability of the events will be maintained with Sen. Jones' bill while also providing increased oversight that the gaming control board has been saying that they need," said Jean Kordenbrock, manager of the Michigan Charitable Gaming Association. Rick Kalm, executive director of the gaming control board, said he wasn't asked to provide input on Jones' bill, and he hasn't analyzed its potential regulatory impact. He said he's going to continue moving forward with his new rules unless the Legislature acts. As long as his rules go into effect, he plans to lift aon new millionaire party locations. The  was put in place in 2011 to slow down the rapid growth of charity poker rooms while the state could get a handle on regulations. But since then, the state has forced more than 22 locations to close for violations, leaving only about 30 left. Kalm said he prefers to have more rooms so charities can host games close to their home base instead of traveling across the state.

Their best offensive performances have been based on getting Bellerin and Nacho Monreal or Sead Kolasinac to the bar line through combination play with Arsenal narrow midfielders..

Further I admit that I was not in the shape that I wanted to be in on race day, which may have had an adverse effect on my expectation of the event.

The truth about student loans is that they became, under the incredibly pro market policies of Ronald Reagan, a way to extract profit from students. At this point, the average graduating college student is about $24,000 in debt in commercial loans to banks as well as another couple of thousand dollars in credit card debt. That because the government student loan subsidies started going to commercial banks (rather than being distributed through Pell grants and other state run programs) so banks could make a profit off of students and their families.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsTV GuideDigital Print EditionI WOULD like the community to be aware of the following:   When the Corowa Bowling Club went into receivership, a group of concerned citizens purchased the land lease and building with the intention of getting it back up and running as a community club;   Nine sporting clubs representing the community of Corowa took on the challenge along with Ivan Ross and got the club operating once again;   After five years of operation the sporting clubs sold the lease and building to the RSL Club for $500,000 which was paid back to the original group of concerned citizens;   The RSL Club was also handed more than $1,000,000 worth of poker machine licences from this community group;   The RSL stated that they would run the club for a minimum of five years to show that the purchase was genuine; and,   Just on five years lapsed, and the RSL closed the club. I feel that the RSL Club owes a debt to the community of Corowa because we have given them the poker machine licences to continue to operate the club, which they have not done. If the RSL were fair dinkum, they would give the bowling club building to the Corowa Shire (the community) for bowling activities and community purposes.

How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the weakest chapter of the three motion picture adaptations of Cressida Cowell's series and, despite the strong animation, there's a sense that the story has run out of steam. Although children may enjoy this one as much as the others (the lighter tone, in fact, may make it the favorite), adults are likely to find it less absorbing. The time has come to let the dragon training end. On the other hand, the lack of a genuine ending leaves the narrative unfinished and results in a sense of disappointment when the end credits roll. If the movie doesn't make a big enough box office splash (almost a given), this promising beginning will have no true climax or conclusion. Whatever happened to the concept of every movie having a beginning, a middle, and an ending? (If there is an Alita 2, I may have to revisit the film's star rating. As part of a series, it undoubtedly would work better than it does as a stand alone.)
I think you want to check your option preflop, you don want to bloat pots out of position, especially with marginal hands like this one and maniac villains behind you who can put you in tough spots.

Sure, but it depends what you mean by action. All of those mentioned hands are just going to call Labats 3 bet (if he did 3bet), and play somewhat passively post. Also, what happens if someone has JJ or QQ behind. Sure, they might squeeze, but they also might just flat the 3bet or just fold. If Labat flats, it gives him a great opportunity to backraise preflop and steal tons of dead money, while still preserving his stack for the time being. Overall, he played it totally reasonable

Preliminary animal studies pointed to a role of magnesium in depression, as depletion of magnesium in the diet of mice lead to enhanced depression  and anxiety related behavior such as increased immobility time in the forced swim test (12). In the forced swim test, a common assay for examining depression like behavior in rodents, the animal is confined to a container filled with water and observed as it attempts to escape. The time in which the animal exhibits immobility is used as a barometer of despair, indicating that the animal has succumbed to a fate of drowning (1).
