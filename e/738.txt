No insults or attacks of any kind. Abusive posters will be banned. We don care if they called you names first; report the abuse to us and we will deal with the offending party (getting into a name calling spat will likely just get all parties involved banned.)The skillset crossover between a professional poker player and a market trader is actually huge. Not only the statistical/probabilistic mindset required, but the psychological aspects of dealing with risk, riding out downswings/variance and concentrating on the larger picture.

That a lot of names, and you have to remember that it not always common for a priest to stay in the same parish for their whole career, so those priests could have moved to a new diocese, abusing children there, and making it seem like a hugely widespread problem throughout the entire Church, which you could argue it is since they basically giving pedophiles a wider area to abuse even more kids.

I will never forget that look of horror on my friend face as his mom turned around for a moment and made eye contact with her horrified son, who proceeded to drop the butter chicken take away container he was carrying and ran away screaming like a Bieber fan caught in an Anthrax mosh pit.
I still not over The 13th Doctor having Pythagoras shades in the pocket of her new coat in episode 2, despite not having anything in her pockets in episode 1, before reuniting with the TARDIS. That is unforgivable continuity to me, all for the sake of a casual time travel reference. I reckon Moffat would have either picked up on that and either saved the joke until a later episode post TARDIS return, or explained where she found them from, perhaps a safety deposit box The Doctor keeps on earth..

Everything else raised in the June 2017 is laughable: that failure to take a gas guage reading was a "Brady violation," that a missing voicemail would somehow have proven Teresa went to the Zipperer house last, despite the Zipperer testimony and the absence of any supporting evidence for the claim.

JONATHAN DUHAMEL: I been a Habs fan since I was born. One of my first memories is the 1993 Stanley Cup win. I was born in 1987, so I didn get to see the 1986 Stanley Cup victory. I remember one of the first times my dad, Luc, brought me to the Forum back in the day. It was the only time I saw a game there. I was probably five years old. I remember we beat the Boston Bruins 4 3 in overtime. Ever since then, I been a Habs fan. We had some pretty good seats. That was really the first time that I got to see all the people watching the game and how everyone was so passionate about the game and about the team. I think at that point I really became a Habs fan. My dad was trying to give me an appreciation for the sport of hockey. Then, you grow up watching the sport and you get hooked right away.

The only up side to this recommendation is that it might be one way of keeping the oral storytelling tradition alive (especially among those superstitious enough not to keep it in the house), but then again, many people are lazy or don have time to do learn or tell the story properly, at least as far as I can guess..

Fantasies are just that, fantasies. Separate the real world from the fictional world, but you can really (and shouldn suppress yourself; it is unhealthy. I think people our age (I 28, so still young) have issues with this because we grew up with social media which paints unrealistic pictures of everybody and their lives and makes people seem more exciting and interesting than they really are.

Where right now they are (as far as I know) generated upon each circle close, this leads to fewer end circles near the coast like we see on Vikendi.

He also said "you're good", which basically conveys you should table your hand. Some people will table their bluffs very confidently and without saying anything, hoping to get their opponent to muck accidentally   I'd say that is more angle shooty.

Spaying or neutering a dog also has a positive effect on behavior. If there's a female dog in heat practically anywhere in the known universe, an unaltered male dog will know it. He'll try to get out, roam far and wide, mark your furniture and other things with urine, and may become overly aggressive. An unspayed female goes through the mess of heat (estrus) about twice a year, during which she may also try to escape or become more unpredictable in her behavior. Without the ebb and flow of those hormonal tides, spayed and neutered dogs are more consistent in their temperament   which makes training easier   yet their zeal in protecting you and your home is undiminished.

It takes a while to get a Champion though, so for the investment, probably worth it.

Knowing who the players are who can't control themselves and taking advantage of them is vital. I am at my worst when I play too many hands, call down too many bets just to see the other guy's cards, and get aggressive in situations where it's unlikely to pay off.

My ex did the same thing, two separate incidents  I found another girl's thong in his bedsheets, and then a girl messaged me apologizing frantically that she didn't know he was in a relationship.

So, while fans may be suffering through short/split seasons now, the disappointing scenario could potentially pay off in the form of a spinoff (maybe). "If you're a creator on a show, having one of these split seasons, or having two final seasons gives you a point to aim for, narratively," Fienberg says. "It lets you know where you're headed, and how many episodes you have to get there and often gives you a break in the middle for writing or just for preparing for the scale of the closing episodes.

Your story hits close to home too. My youngest brother is still in college, so even though he can contribute financially, in many ways, I say he provides the most (in terms of emotional support, since he stays with my mom over all of his breaks.)

But it sounds like you are asking about whether it okay to share a news article (for example) that uses Facebook or Disqus to run their comments section? Our rule against linking to social media is to protect users anonymity, and the things we remove under this rule include people sharing unedited screenshots of their family Facebook conversations or blogs that have a bunch of identifying information. Honestly, I can think of a time when we removed a news article just because it had a comments section (except in this case of an article bringing out the estranged parents in the comments, which happens every so often). I happy to check with the other mods in case they have a different opinion, but your example feels like an edge case that we wouldn remove unless there was something else obviously problematic [EDIT: for example, if it broke our drive by diagnosis rule]..

Compared to perfume, cologne is one of the lighter types of fragrances in terms of the concentration and strength of the aromatic oils it contains. However, colognes can still have heavier, long lasting scents. When applying, dab a little onto your neck, just above your collarbone and the pulse points on your wrist. Let your body heat trigger the scent. If you're really afraid of overdoing it, spray one spritz in the air above you and walk through the mist it creates so that the scent is more evenly distributed. If you can't smell it on you right after you put it on, don't just add more. It can take a good 15 minutes for the scent to really sink in and react with your chemical makeup.
If the blinds did not escalate, then tournaments could take quite a long time. For example, a tournament might start with the blinds at 25 50, and progress to 50 100, 75 150, 100 200, 200 400, and so forth. The fact that blinds escalate during a tournament and there are only a set number of chips in play makes tournament play somewhat different than live game play.

It just seems that the ideology of the left and the ideology of masculinity are simply irreconcilable and that men who would be swayed by MRA will be swayed by MRA.

They can hardly be assuaged from their value in masculinity, and incorporating this value is counterproductive to leftist goals..

That way, you can include the registry information in the invitation. Guests like to know what the new mother needs   it makes gift buying much easier and will help to ensure that the new baby has everything that he or she needs.

There are four types of Hold'em, with different betting structures: Limit Holdem The bet or raise value is a fixed amount on all streets, equal to the Big Blind pre flop and on the flop and DOUBLE the Big Blind (equal to a Big Bet) on the turn and river. A maximum of 3 raises are allowed during each betting round (raise, re raise and cap), putting a betting ceiling of 4 x Big Blind pre flop and on the flop and 8 x Big Blind (or 4 x Big Bet) on the turn and river.

Everybody who talks about atomic energy knows Albert Einstein equation E=Mc2: viz., the energy release in a nuclear reaction can be calculated from the decrease in mass. In the fission of the uranium nucleus, one tenth of one per cent of the mass is converted into energy; in the fusion of four hydrogen nuclei to form helium, seven tenths of one percent is so converted. When these statements are made in newspaper reports, it is usually implied that there ought to be some way in which all the mass of a nucleus could be converted into energy, and that we are merely waiting for technical developments to make this practical.

The situation should be perfect in order to make the slow play the best possible move. For example, if you hold a pair of three's, the flop is Ace of clubs, King of spades and a 3, the pot is relatively high, and there are 5 players in the pot, slow playing isn't the best move..

It really quick to switch them, and you could use a batch file to switch the config files with nothing more than a double click if you wanted.

But too many commentators on the left and the right have accepted the ridiculous idea that the Obama administration is actually socialist. Time to do our homework and show that the Emporer New Clothes may just be the same ol neoliberal con job of making the rich richer gussied up as populist policy.What if the result of all this consolidation of financial power in the hands of a few is that the rich get richer? There is no guarantee that the economic collapse is going to result in a redistribution of wealth, despite the screams of socialism coming from Fox News commentators.In fact, some experts are suggesting that what is really going on is that class interests are being protected by Secretary Geithner and his gang. In other words, there may be a veneer of populism in the new administration rhetoric, but it is disguising the same old class interests and the consolidation of wealth in the hands of the few that has been going on under the guise of neoliberalism for three decades.If Harvey right and what we seeing is the continuation of the consolidation of wealth and assets rather than the reversal of this trend, then it time for an organized and concentrated effort by the media and grass roots movements to reveal what going on.

Weil Walter Saxer, Produktionsleiter vieler Filme Herzogs und derjenige, der Kinski in dem berhmten Clip hat wissen lassen, da er den Scheifra nicht essen msse, klipp und klar gesagt hat, da das Verhltnis zwischen Herzog und Kinski, so wie es in "Mein liebster Feind" dargestellt wurde, nicht der Realitt entsprach, sondern, da sich Herzog in Szene gesetzt hat.

We write this feeling as if we have to grab our community back from the clutches of the gay marriage movement. We're frightened by its path and its incessant desire to assimilate. Believe it or not, we felt incredibly safe, happy, taken care of, and fulfilled with the many queer biological and chosen parents who raised us without the right to marry. Having grown up in queer families and communities we strongly believe that queers are like everyone else. Our families are tangled, messy and beautiful   just like so many straight families who don't fit into the official version of family.

As the wedding ceremony ends, the party is just starting. You, and the rest of the guests, are ushered to a different part of the garden where there are tents and dance floors set up. A band is already playing on a mini stage. The place is covered with little colorful lanterns and vases spilling with flowers.

The next decade, active safety systems will become increasingly intelligent as greater efforts are made to reduce the number of road fatalities worldwide, said TRW chairman and CEO John Plant. automated functions will be introduced that will operate continuously in certain situations in addition to providing emergency support when needed. At IAA 2013, TRW is outlining its portfolio of semi automated driving functions. Moreover, we will see a greater market penetration of both active and passive safety technologies as new mandates, changes to NCAP schemes and insurance incentives come into force worldwide. Our technology roadmap has been specifically designed to support these trends and to ensure that our systems are affordable for all vehicle segments and in all markets. highlights include:

Another introvert here. I do love going out and socializing with my friends but as far as making new ones, it hard for me. I tend to not like most people and have a difficult time trying to figure out what things to say and how to act. 
Customers would try to sell us stolen stuff, too. It was like a trading caravan in Sherwood Forest. I got cornered in the parking lot by two girls with iodine stained fingers who were determined to sell me a bag of women's cosmetics that I'm pretty sure still had shards of broken glass in it.

Leaves of baby kale add a pleasantly bitter bite, cleansing your palate from the richness of the cheese and bacon. House fried potato chips add a textural complement, though you could opt for a side salad instead.One bite of the Florentine Chicken Crepe brings the delicate richness of sweet cream. Is that a hint of nutmeg your tongue detects? Another bite uncovers the nuttiness of melted Gruyere grounded by the earthiness of sauteed shitakes.

They much cheaper than honey bees, perhaps you don really need to worry about funds. 
Your friends are results oriented. You played this hand fine, especially as you didn seem to realize just how stupidly sticky he was until he showed up with this AK. If the turn was any other T, I think I consider betting again intending to check back all rivers, but like you said, it literally the worst card in the deck, and the majority of combos that you beat still have a ton of equity against your hand, and I really doubt he folding most of them if he calling fucking AK on that board in a bomb pot.

Inquisitive students may ask many questions about your "why" explanation. 
Range advantage can mean two things and it important to differentiate between having more nut combinations and having more equity. When your range has more equity, usually the bet frequency is what increases first. 
3. If you take advance rent, you must record the income in the year you receive it. It is constructive receipt. Individuals and many small businesses have cash basis accounting, not accrual. If you get 12 months of rent on 8/1/16, that money is 2016 income, but you won't have but 5 months of expense. Do the math and visit a CPA.
If you're looking to get things started on the right foot and have a few dollars to spend, you can invest in a set of chips from Paulson. Paulson poker chips are pretty much the Rolls Royce of chips, and you'll certainly be spoiling the regulars at your poker nights by having a set of them. Picking up a set of these will set you back around a buck a chip, but are almost an investment in themselves as they tend to maintain a decent resale value, which may come in handy when your wife of girlfriend kicks you and your buddies out of the house for getting too rowdy on your poker night.. 
Losing the face of the franchise wouldn just leave a crater sized hole to fill on the Eskimos roster, it would also be a big blow to the business side of the equation.

The veracity of Jones claims remained in doubt Friday. 
It actually not unreasonable to claim a dose that low would have some sort of an effect, maybe not with LSD but certainly with other drugs that act on HT2a. Look at Charles Nichols (yup, David Nichols son) studies on the anti inflammatory effects of DOI in vivo. They have demonstrated potent anti TNF effects in rats at far below the cognitive/CNS effects that recreational users associate with the drugs. There are ongoing studies to test as an athesma treatment in humans and patents filed. Also look at the FDA approved drug lorcaserin, which is a psychedelic acting on the HT2c receptors, the ones in question for causing heart problems. As long as the patients take the medicinally active amount far below threashold CNS effects, there nothing "psychedelic" about it unless you "OD" in which case you have an uncomfortable trip.
They don have any coins their wallet is empty. They have to refill it. So those coins on their site in your wallet they give to other players that cash out ahead of you. They need someone that knows how to run a poker site properly to succeed. And they cleary don have it. Why the coin is under 1 penny now. they didn make it decentralized so this kind of stuff is going to happen. They have no business giving away the coins you won to other players. Its like putting your money in the bank and you want to do a withdrawal and they say oh we need to print up more money we gave your money to someone else that wanted to cash out. You will have to wait until we refill our bank with cash. Imo thats ridiculous.
Yes, they are! And guns are more dangerous than cars. But cigarettes are chronically dangerous, in that it takes a really long time to die from it. Guns are acutely dangerous, in that they kill you right here right now.
If there are no price controls, the prices will go up to absorb the higher wages. If there are price controls, most likely suppliers will find other sources of those materials/services, most likely in other countries that don have the same strictures.

This lone county jail in a remote corner of Appalachia offers an agonizing glimpse into how the tidal wave of opioids and methamphetamines has ravaged America. Here and in countless other places, addiction is driving skyrocketing rates of incarcerated women, tearing apart families while squeezing communities that lack money, treatment programs and permanent solutions to close the revolving door. More than a decade ago, there were rarely more than 10 women in the Campbell County Jail in northeast Tennessee. Now the population is routinely around 60. Most who end up here have followed a similar path: they arrested on a drug related charge and confined to a cell 23 hours a day. Many of their bunkmates also are addicts. They receive no counseling. Then weeks, months or years later, they released into the same community where friends   and in some cases, family   are using drugs. Soon they are again, too. And the cycle begins anew: Another arrest, another booking photo, another pink uniform and off to a cell to simmer in regret and despair. By David Goldman/Associated Press
This was the norm, not the exception. So calling a brothel a "nunnery" is a typically Elizabethan sort of wordplay; it not just a joke that funny because it not true, it layered with truths and competing meanings. It also funny because it is true.
Some of the Churches we worshiped in have fallen into damnable disgrace. Huge pharmaceutical companies have been caught doing far more harm to peoples heath than good. Soulless corporations bloody mindedly and shamelessly rape our world.

Schremf got an emerald.Aside: a lot of people give credit to Dwight Howard for that 2009 run, but because of hedo, lewis, nelson, reddick (and the guy everyone forgets, mikael pietrus who played out of his mind.) Howard barely ever got doubled. He could feast all day. Because nobody on the cavs could match up 1v1 on howard, they got lit up.As a reaction to this, they got Shaq to guard howard, which caused the cavs to give up way too many assets, and destroy themselves from within.

Lastly in this short post I include an interesting view of the future, found at the end of an appreciation of John Roebling in a volume of the Journal of the Franklin Institute for 1867. It is a statement on the plans for building the Brooklyn Bridge at teh time it was still the "New York and Brooklyn Bridge", and then the "East River Bridge", though "Brooklyn Bridge" was also used, the official designation of that final name coming in 1915. The recipient of this effort was the McVickers Building in Chicago, a theater that opened in 1857 and came to it slow end in 1922. It looks like the last bit of currency was squeezed out of this old building, performances being given right to the very end while foundations for the new building were being constructed 24 hours a day. Int he world of cross sections this is a good one, and also pretty unusual. Also in the top left corner we see a photo of a caisson under construction a shot I don see very often in my searches of old stuff.

So, even if a European would normally, say. be less likely to bluff. (which I am just using as an example. I have no idea if it is true), he would have to change his style occasionally, just to be able to compete.
