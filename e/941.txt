This is nothing like a seizure, it's not even mixed. Your body simply does not move this way in a seizure state. The electrical storm sends impulses to muscle groups that don't usually work together. It's part of the reason seizures are so unsettling, seeing someone move in such an unnatural fashion is immediately recognisable as someone's body 'malfunctioning' for want of a better word. It looks nothing like this coordinated shiver/spasm. All I see is someone shaking their own legs and torso, as the camera pans back up you even see her left shoulder tense and move in order to gain more leverage due to the effort that is required to do that. No facial grimace, no unnatural splaying of digits.

I would say that if you did want to see him in the future I wouldn do it alone. I would suggest if you and your friends have card night you do that together.

I'm sure eventually it will get sorted either by one murdering the other or getting kicked out by the realestate. In my opinion the only time to involve the police is if there are young children present in the household and maybe then they will do something, but even so, unlikely.

Focus more on the human side of management. In his 1996 article, "The Human Side of Management", Thomas Teal noted that "mediocre management is the norm" and that one reason for this is that "in educating and training managers, we focus too much on technical proficiency and too little on character But we're still in the Dark Ages when it comes to teaching people how to behave like great managers   somehow instilling in them capacities such as courage and integrity that can't be taught. Perhaps as a consequence, we've developed a tendency to downplay the importance of the human element in managing." Twenty years later, this still rings true. Poor management demoralises people and ultimately takes a toll on performance. At a minimum, perhaps we should have everyone read Bob Sutton's first book, on building a civilised workplace and his second one on surviving one that isn't.

Vanmorgen werden we gebeld dat er in het ziekenhuis een plaats was vrijgekomen. Jan zou de plaats kunnen innemen. Dat Jan de plaats heeft gekregen heeft volgens ons te maken met het feit dat de dokters Jan al eens in levende lijve hadden ontmoet.

Anna is worldly and chic, but like her bourgeois literary cousin Emma Bovary, she's naive enough to still believe in romantic love. She resists the seductive come ons of the young army officer Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor Johnson) until she doesn't; then she follows her heart to social ostracism, paranoia, and ruin. Wright, though, understands that Tolstoy was writing about more than one woman's passion   that the novelist was painting his country and times on an immense canvas   and that Anna's drama is just the central panel of a vast, teeming triptych.
Enter the raked stage.

This response is also known as sympatho adrenal response of the body, as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla (but also all other sympathetic fibers) secrete acetylcholine, which activates the secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from it. Therefore, this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.Science typically looks at the SNS as an automatic regulation system, that is, one that operates without the intervention of conscious thought.

I pulled from the current US law code. Your source (which you didnt really give) is from the 1790 and the law I cited was modified in 1956. Now I dont claim to be a legal expert, but I dont think its unreasonable to say that the law has been modified since the 1790 Tell me, which source is more correct? How am I wrong for citing from current US law? Because pointing to a bill written when the US government was literally younger that I am isnt very convincing..

The old Good Buildings have felt the pinch from a bevy of new luxury condos with tasteful design elements (such as limestone faades instead of glass) and vastly superior amenities. What's more, condos don't have intrusive co op boards, which dissect an applicant's financials to an embarrassing degree. Now the trader who wants to live in his business rival's building doesn't have to pull his pants down to get in. Stern is the fashionable designer of the new Good Building. His 15 Central Park West   boasting new classical limestone structures that match the grandeur (and occasionally beauty) of its elders   was the first one to arrive 10 years ago. Further buildings by Stern, including 15 Central Park West, 30 Park Place, 70 Vestry, 20 East End Ave. and, when they are completed, 220 Central Park South and 520 Park Ave., all make the cut. Walker Tower, with 18 inch thick walls, 14 foot ceilings, stunning Art Deco architecture and important residents (if you don't mind living with a few celebs) is a new Good Building.

Now ironically, the spread of STIs and access to safe reproductive healthcare which is very deeply connected to the rise of HIV cases is a part of Planned Parenthood, a concept that Trump and his cult mob stand against.

There is an increasing number of places that explicitly and shamelessly practice "believe the accuser" method of dealing with sexual assault cases. People have been denied representation, denied the right to face their accuser, denied cross examination, evidence viewed with absurd bias, etc. Often done to comically absurd degree. Such as many reported University cases. So the fear is very real and it not because of how likely it is to happen statistically but that you can end up in one of these spaces where you have no chance of justice. In fact the rarity shouldn be used as an excuse to play down this fear, it is more often than not the unlikely event that is the most horrifying. Not to mention the people that do make false allegations, even when it absolutely proven that it what they did, face no consequences.

You spazzed on the flop. I know you trying to justify it, but it a spazz. You said yourself that the Villain can have K8s or 97s so that means he has ALL the sets, ALL the combo draws, ALL the two pair combos, ALL the Aces, and he uncapped.

The catch for Zynga is that the Facebook gravy train may not last forever, and the company will eventually need more distribution partners. and Facebook will continue to exist in a relationship of cooperative competition, according to Werbach. can afford to put all its eggs in Facebook basket, but neither can it live without the enormous push that it gets from its Facebook relationship. which recently launched a new social network called Google+ to compete with Facebook, would seem to be a natural diversification option for Zynga. However, Zynga would still be dependent on what Clemons calls parallel monopolies. that in five years, the world is 50% Google and 50% Facebook, Clemons says. will still need both. Half of its revenues go away if it gets into a fight with either. Distribution does not diversify as easily as other resources. 2010, Zynga cut a distribution deal with Yahoo to feature games, including poker, FishVille and Mafia Wars, on the search engine games channel. The company has not disclosed revenue generated from the Yahoo partnership. In its broadest global diversification move to date, Zynga on July 26 announced that it has partnered with Tencent, one of China top Internet service providers. The move could give Zynga a much broader reach and keep the company Facebook deal intact because the social network does not operate in China.

So why did the 2004 National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines expand the previous guidelines to recommend that more people take statins (from 13 million to 40 million) and that people who don't have heart disease should take them to prevent heart disease.

Thirty four other non industry affiliated experts sent a petition to protest the recommendations to the National Institutes of Health saying the evidence was weak.

There might be some better plan than that, but it would make the situation for attributes alone balanced at least. Tree balance in general is a much tougher problem, but it would at least be made slightly easier if attribute nodes had a simpler meaning.poe9Hipster > Meta 1 point  submitted 7 days agoThe point you are trying to make doesn't make much sense.

Being number one in a tournament is very difficult. You should cash in a tournament about 20% of the time. Cashing in a tournament means finishing in the top spots that pay. Usually top 10 or 20 percent of the field. The question really depends on the way you want to play poker, though. If you a professional playing the big tournaments, Phirad nailed it. But if you a professional playing online tournaments with variable playing fields and (usually) shorter tournaments, you could play 100 games in a year (probably a lot more.) Some of the top online players are known to hit the money in roughly %15 of their online tournaments. It may not seem like much, but that %15 of their tournaments, and probably a very deep finish for them with lots of money on the line.

Editor's Note: The gut brain axis an imaginary line between the brain and the gut is one of the new frontiers of neuroscience.Microbiota in our gut, sometimes referred to as the "second genome" or the "second brain," may influence our mood in ways that scientists are just now beginning to understand.Unlike with inherited genes, it may be possible to reshape, or even to cultivate, this second genome.As research evolves from mice to people, further understanding of microbiota's relationship to the human brain could have significant mental health implications.a scientist, I often find myself chatting with friends and neighbors about the latest advances in neuroscience.In the past few years I have found more and more people asking about microbiota the microorganisms that typically inhabit a bodily organ.In the last 10 years, I've been one of many neuroscientists advancing new ideas about how microbiota in the gut affects brain function.The media has taken notice as well.Recent stories on the gut brain axis among the most exciting new frontiers in neuroscience include "Some of My Best Friends Are Germs" in the New York Times Magazine and "Gut Microbes Contribute to Mysterious Malnutrition" in National Geographic.In 2012, the editors of Science thought the research important enough to devote a special issue to the topic.Why is the issue so fascinating? For one thing, it's heightened consciousness of how diet and nutrition impact our health.For another, it's sheer numbers.Our brains contain billions of neurons, but we less often talk about the fact that trillions of "good" bacteria are alive and well in our intestinal tracts.Remarkably, these naturally occurring, ever present commensal bacteria may be instrumental in how our brain develops, how we behave, react to stress, and respond to treatment for depression and anxiety.With such serious mental health implications to consider, there is substantial buzz among neuroscientists about the bidirectional nature of these seemingly infinite relationships.I am continually impressed by the creative ways that my colleagues are making discoveries, especially in how microbiota may influence the brain and the immune system during early life.And just last week researchers at UCLA found that regularly eating yogurt with probiotics, which contain "good" bacteria, seems to affect brain functioning in women.Scientists have recognized communication between the brain and the gut for more than 100 years, with studies in the early 19th and 20th centuries showing that a person's emotional state can alter the function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.1 3 One of the best examples is the work of William Beaumont, an army surgeon, who became known as the "Father of Gastric Physiology." In the 1830s, Beaumont, who was able to monitor gastric secretions through a fistula (a permanent opening in the stomach wall), noted an association between changing moods and gastric secretions.

You don't have anything in your hand, but your opponent checks to you. Imagine you're considering betting $15. In that case, you can make an assumption about your opponent's chances of folding let's say you estimate it to be two thirds, based on their folding behavior in the past.

It that whole glass house thing.

This limit is in the name of the poker game ($3/6, $20/40, etc.).

"We don't exclude common phrases and clich expressions from the algorithm," a representative from Turnitin explains to me about the process. "We check student work against our database, and if there are instances where student writing is similar to, or matches against, one of our sources, we will flag this for an instructor to review. Ultimately, human judgement is required to make a determination about plagiarism, and it's likely that, if a commonly used phrase is flagged, an instructor would make the distinction.".

The tensions that the police ops in Lyari are instigating are dangerous and widespread. They go far beyond the problems of urban decay, or ethnic ghettoisation in Karachi. The majority of Lyari is Sindhi and Baloch. It doesn take a genius to figure out that a cheap and easy route to the hearts and minds in the Sindhi countryside is through blood in Lyari. Claiming victimhood in Lyari will resonate with Sindhis across the province. This is an exceptionally opportune thing. It isn every day that Sindhis get a headline in discussions about Karachi.
