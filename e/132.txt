They raised it this year. The lowest pension in China today is 88 RMB per month. I bet most old rural people got this type of pension in China, somewhere around 100 RMB per month or a couple of hundreds. Might be higher in rural areas in richer provinces. In which province? Pensions might also differ between different areas within a province, some villages might be more generous than others. These low pensions are for rural areas. Pensions in cities should be at least 2000 per month, probably 3000 is common pension in Chongqing city. Heard some old guy in Beijing in a hutong who said he had a pension on around 5000 per month.

Set (metaphorical) traps. An old saying describes cunning as "finding the path that your enemy has chosen, then digging holes along that path." Though it's highly unlikely that you'll ever have to set real traps for anyone, take the metaphor to heart. By judging another's strengths, weaknesses, and motivations, you can ascertain the "path" they are on and sabotage it for your personal benefit. Look for ways to exploit your enemy's weaknesses while rendering their strengths useless. Try to put your enemies in situations where they're likely to mess up.

Mass bombings, burglaries, rapes, murders, death toll in the millions, maimed and injured in the tens of millions, psychologically damaged in the hundreds of millions, property losses and damages in the trillions, the losses of skilled tradesmen and experienced professionals and families are incalculable. Warlords and factions spring up overnight. Power shifts, and power vaccums become the new norm. And as the end of the purge draws near people rush to seek vengeance and redemption against those that wronged them. Times up, but everyone is still going at it, trying to get as much out of it as they can. Military and police are called in, anger turns to fear and panic. The factions and warlords push hard to consolidate their power, lines are drawn and sides are taken. Society has collapsed.

Reasons Why You May Be Suffering With Depression Ronald J.
This is an additional pathway that microbiota and pathogenic bacteria use to communicate with the brain via the immune system or through activation of local neurons in the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is a part of the autonomic nervous system that is housed in the gut and is responsible for gut motility and other normal gut functions.28 It is a vast network of neurons that are the first points of contact for microbiota in the intestinal lumen and are an important component of the brain gut axis.One of the most common clinical features of depression is dysregulation of the stress response system, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis.29 As was previously noted, in response to psychological, physiological, and pathological challenges, neurons in the hypothalamus are activated and signal the pituitary to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone into the bloodstream, which in turn activates the adrenal gland to release the stress hormone cortisol. The stress response, or HPA activation, is part of our normal homeostatic processes, and yet, in depression, it is often overactive or, in some cases, underactive.29 One of the first studies considering stress and microbiota demonstrated that germ free mice have an overactive stress response.23 A more recent study has shown that stress exposure during early life in rats disrupts the microbiota profile and leads to increased stress reactivity in adulthood.30 Importantly, in this study, treatment of rat pups with probiotic Lactobacillus sp.

Now this was funny as well a very serious charge. We had no access to check this out from Big Khan as he had stopped coming to Parliament. Sheikh Aftab had a point when he asked why did the PTI take oath if the elections were rigged. More important, why did they question the PML (N) mandate after a year and not earlier. Well, we too fail to understand why can't the PTI tell us its demands about electoral reforms. We can understand if Imran is keeping his political strategy close to his chest but why not share his electoral demands. Quite possibly, they could be accepted without having to turn the country upside down and risking myriad lives. But then this is not the only thing that we don't understand about the illogical Khan.

Yeah I can say 88 is marginal. You might get 1 or even 2 folds by raising. Checking pre guarantees you are against 2 players OOP and honestly you got one of the only flops that you don hate. The flop raise was really small. If someone has an A they are calling bigger raises. You gave them over 2 1 to call which means almost any hand other than stone cold nothing was going to call. Turn bet was good. Don hate the river bet either really. You are never check folding. Maybe you check call but not sure the bet sizing is different. And betting say half pot then folding is not happening when that would only be another 40 to call. Just got drawn out on.

I think your idea of the Eastern Front is a bit off. Firstly, Russia had about half of their forces stationed over in the east preparing from a Japanese attack. The Russo Japanese War wasn all that long ago, and Japan had been running amok for a while in China. So opening up a second front against a nation that isn fully prepared is a strategic move. Especially when that nation has been aiding you and has signed a non aggression pact with you up until this point.

In germ free mice, the adaptive immune system is undeveloped. Since gut microbiota are essential for immune system development, germ free mice can be considered to have a low level of inflammation. When we consider the link between inflammation and anxiety like behavior, we observe that a low inflammatory state is associated with low anxiety like behavior, whereas higher levels of inflammation lead to increased anxiety like behavior.17 For example, infection with the parasite Trichuris muris in mice results in gut inflammation and increased anxiety like behavior.24 In addition, chemically induced gut inflammation in an animal model of colitis also results in gut inflammation and increased anxiety like behavior.24 Evidence that the microbiota acts as a modulator of this immune related increase in anxiety like behavior is provided in the same reports stating that treatment with probiotic Bifidobacterium longum alleviated the anxiety like behavior.24,25 These observations suggest that probiotic treatment may have potential for treatment of inflammation and related anxiety symptoms.Commensal bacteria play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal tract, and in situations of stress or disease, increased intestinal permeability can contribute to increased inflammation.26, 27 Increased intestinal permeability, sometimes referred to as "leaky gut," can lead to translocation of bacteria out of the lumen of the GI tract across the intestinal layer.

For comparison, if we consider the Falcon Heavy, it has a combined thrust slightly higher than a single three (see below) F1 engine on the Saturn V. It also has a slightly higher specific impulse. It carries about half as much fuel as the SV, but critically, while FH has about half the payload capacity (in reusable configuration afaik), even in expendable configuration, the FH costs a tenth of what the Saturn V cost to fly.

This question is a little bit tricky. In a deck of 52 cards, one fourth or 13 cards are spades. So, the chance of drawing one spade = 13/52 or 0.25. If a second card drawn, there's one less spade in the deck, so the probability on the second draw is 12/51. In quality control, it is very common to sample without replacement as bad parts are discarded. If we consider drawing one card, putting it back in the deck, regardless if it is a spade or not, then reshuffling the deck and drawing the second card, the probability is 0.25 x 0.25 = 0.0625, a bit higher with replacement. This is the same as 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/8 or saying the odds are 1:8. I've included a couple of links on sampling with replacement and without replacement. Generally, for calculating statistics, we attempt to get independent results. The draw of one card, will reduce the population, and change the probabilities on the second draw, so sampling without replacement is not independent sampling. See related links. (Full Answer)

Likewise, a loved one may not want to face the fact that his or her friend or family member has a drug or alcohol problem. He may ignore evidence when it first begins to appear, and even make excuses for the person to avoid facing the issue. Only when more severe issues come into play is the addiction acknowledged. Other times, the addict is good at hiding the evidence, and loved ones may not notice the more subtle clues pointing toward a substance dependency.

Maybe we should all get guns and never comply with the police or the courts. Maybe we should all view the police as a common enemy and never allow them to take a fellow citizen into custody. Maybe we should revolt. We all fear the breakdown of "the system," so no matter how fucked up "the system" gets, we all put up with it. It is going to get worse. I don think we will revolt until things get far worse. We will just continue to go to our bullshit jobs so that we can pay our bullshit bills while elitists like Manafort and Judge Cocksucker live it up immune from any checks on their behavior.

The same thing happens in the startup world. We develop unrealistic expectations of success. Pinterest becomes the hottest new social network overnight. Instagram closes a $1 billion buyout only 2 years after launching. Draw Something hits 50 million downloads in just a few weeks.

You know what my main gripe is with all these "how to deal with introverts" thing is. That it goes both ways with extroversion and introversion. Not all extroverts have heaps of friends, because sometimes when a tendency towards extroversion is mixed with an intense personality (note that intro/extro have nothing to do with personality outright) they will not be good at keeping people around that they crave for their energy. As extroverted people tend to gain energy from being around people and being alone drains them. So as an introvert myself i try be understanding when someone is trying really hard to communicate with me, because maybe they are just as lonely as a lot of so called "introverted" people claim to be. They are living in their own lonely hell but being alone nearly destroys them. See example, Micheal Scott From the American Office. /endrant

Those docs do work training residents but you can request to be a "midwives only" patient if you don't like that and will only see a fellow or attending (more experienced doc) in case of emergency or if you like that doc on call and say you're okay with it.

Last but not least I wonder if there would not be a better timing to get a sky to have more contrast to the skyline. The clouds on the top edge look interesting enough but are so monotonous towards the building tops/horizon that they lack impact on the whole image. And so does the uniformity of the water. There is no added value to the image by showing so much water. From the framing point of view I am not sure if it would not have a higher impact if less water and more sky was visible. Or generally a tighter crop to expose the density of the buildings rather than trying to show that wide of an angle.

For some ChIP seq examples, some transcriptional activators and repressors work by binding near gene promoters and interacting with the transcriptional machinery there directly. Because of this, you would tend to annotate these proteins in relation to transcription start sites. On the other hand, there are certain proteins you would expect to be over gene bodies. These would include proteins like the RNA polymerase, and certain histone modifying enzymes (and the marks they themselves modify). There are other proteins whose expected regions of binding are a little less well defined in relations to genes. These could include proteins that bind to enhancers, and other proteins involved in 3D chromatin architecture, such as cohesin and CTCF. It may not necessarily be informative to annotate these naively in relation to gene features, but rather other higher order DNA architecture annotations would be better instead.

A. Vaccines don't shed. Shedding is the process of virus erupting from cells due to its replication process. Vaccines in the US are all acellular or attenuated, meaning they are incapable of replication of any sort. The only exception to this in common use is the oral polio vaccine, which in exceedingly rare cases can mutate to a pathogenic form. Hence, it's not used in the USA. To reiterate, all vaccines your child will receive are bits of virus that aren't capable of causing a disease, but which will reliably generate an immune response (mild moderate fever, slight swelling, mild inflammation at injection site, in addition to antibody production).

Sometimes you will be up against a maniac, or at least a very loose player and know you are probably ahead. Your strategy here is to re raise, isolate and not let him draw out. That means over betting the pot against maniacs. Again, your poker calculator is just not going to agree with this strategy here. Surviving against such players means you have to create certain aggressive opportunities or they will just simply take you down hand by hand.

3. Levels means thinking about what you have, what your opponent has, what your opponent thinks you have, what your opponent thinks you think he/she has, and so on. Thinking beyond the first two or three levels is rarely necessary in low limit Hold'em, but as you advance in limits and as your opponents become stronger players, it becomes necessary to think on many levels. Remember that poker is a game of information, and the better your opponents play, the more information you will need to be successful.

We didn and we are being punished for every mistake we make at this moment and time. The game was always going to be uphill then. Even when we did get a chance, Karl Moore hits the post and then it bobbles out.

It must have just been the picture in my head or something because the ESPN Poker Club Wooden 4 Deck Dealer Shoe has action better than any other one I've used before. Maybe not, but since my expectations weren't necessarily thinking this was going to be a homerun purchase it just made it a lot better. However, it wasn't the wood appeal that made this an exceptional buy, it was the other benefits as well..

Bluffing is an important part of your game but if you are beginner, don't try to hone your skills of bluffing in big stakes games or tournaments. That's what free online poker is for. 
In the past few years, hold 'em has evolved again into a hyperaggressive contest for betting bullies who risk all their chips at bizarre moments. The new breed of player seems to ignore the cards in his hand and instead bases his bets on patterns discovered by playing countless online hands. It didn't take long for the best online players to figure out how to use that data in live play, and they have come to treat even the most prestigious live tournaments like just another online table. 
Right now, I got a nonfiction history (library), a guide on event planning (my own copy), and an autobiography on audio.

I work for insurance companies, and generally, it is different. Most carriers adopt a scoring model from a third party in the insurance industry that generates a "credit based insurance score." My understanding is it is based on the information you'd see in a credit report, but weighted differently to more heavily reflect the indicators for risk when it comes to insurance.

Whereas in contrast, the first interpretation is more literal as she legitimately asks the birds, "How can you sing and fly? Why can't I?" She gets more frustrated as the piece goes on, begging the bird to tell her how it sings, even asking, "Are you screaming?" as if to attempt to make some further connection between her and the bird. Since I was fascinated by those two different interpretations and also because I felt this piece needed to be accessible to all listeners, not just those that had seen the musical, my ultimate decision was to do a combination of both interpretations combined with my own experience. I believed it was vital, as with any art, that I put myself in to it.

The thing that Reddit (mostly) doesn't get is that this idea was mainly pushed from the bottom up by Chinese citizens as a response to the many videos that popped up over the past few years in social media showcasing bad public behaviour. No doubt that the fact that these viral videos painted Chinese people in a bad light as a collective contributed to the support of this scheme..

She was referring to Jeffrey Daniel, Casper Candidate and Cooley Jaxson, who had appeared on the dance show a few years earlier to perform a dance called the boogaloo.

I listen to audiobooks at work on poker. Most of Jonathan Little books are audio and Jonathan is the one that is reading them so it read in the context in which he intended it. That would give you a little more time if you can listen, comprehend, and still do your job. That being said, nothing is better than getting hands in at the table. Playing and experiencing the highs and lows of poker makes me want to be a better player. The analytical discussion of hands and my experience after a session with my close poker friends helps with my decisions in the future. Playing and tracking your play will also affirm or deny your thought if you are a winning player. It takes a lot of hands to really get that picture painted. When I started, I was winning 17 BB/hour and thought I was a king (easy game!), now many thousands of hands later, I winning 7 BB/hour which is more realistic. And could still be high to be honest.

So Jenny kept running away. Every time Forrest gets close and saves her, she runs off before she falters. She won let herself get near him, and as the movie goes on, she fails a little more each time. First she blows him off after the strip club, telling him to stay away. Then she walks with him in DC, but still leaves with her boyfriend. Then she stays with him in his house and finally sleeps with him, after that one critical moment.

A sandy beach at the lake or sea shore is an excellent place to start your hunt. While you may find items along the waters edge, try thinking as if you were coming to this beach to swim or picnic. Most people will look for shade and place their towel and belongings away from the water and, if available, under a shade tree.

Many wives make the mistake of hiring an expensive detective or purchasing pricey spy equipment. 
As for the holdover (again in ontario on the boilerplate listing agreement), it doesn work quite the way you described it. The agent would have a burden of proof to show that they introduced the buyer to the property during the contract in order to have a claim to the commission. This is to prevent people from having the agent market the property and work with buyers only to have the buyer wait for the contract to expire and cut the agent out of the deal, saving the commission costs. For context, in my area, it is common to ask for a 1 year listing and a 6 month holdover even though the average days on market is less than 60 for residential properties.
I was an assistant manager at Blockbuster (Yes I know it dates me a bit) and I was severely underpaid for my role. We were also a training store so I would be training all the new assistant managers that were hired throughout the district.

It was stated very often that is taken into account So clearly there an element of interpretation whenever something is being reviewed. If a huge chunk of Twitter review team has a giant leftwing bias (or an anti rightwing bias), then there going to be way more instances where the interpretation is in favor of someone on the left, and against someone on the right. For example, you might have someone on the left and someone on the right commit equally egregious offenses, but the person reviewing could have an easier time rationalizing "this left winger twitter is full of the kinds of jokes and hyperbole that lefties use all the time.

The definition of ''sexual misconduct'' includes ''any sexual relationship with a child''. 
And this is all when they decide to treat me at all, given how eventually each doctor wants to cut me down to tylenol and acupuncture because I'm "too young to be treated for this much pain." Or they want me to do physical therapy again (even though they tell me they don't feel comfortable treating me since they don't know enough about my condition) after I tell them about how that went for me last time (irreparable neurological damage that lost me use of some pretty important bodily functions and severely damaged my organs as a result). It's so fucking apparent I know more about my condition and the possible treatments than every "specialist" I see, it's gross..

"Our criminal justice system is desperately in need of reform. The obstacles to getting a new trial are simply too great," Brown said. "There was a credible alibi witness who was with Adnan at the precise time of the murder and now the Court of Appeals has said that witness would not have affected the outcome of the proceeding. We think just the opposite is true. From the perspective of the defendant, there is no stronger evidence than an alibi witness."
As I mentioned in other threads last week, yesterday, 2/24 was the Hyannis Marathon. It was my first race of 2019 and my second marathon of my life. It was also the worst race that I have ever run. My damn callous got a damn blister! And it is due to the terrible weather and the my equally terrible training. Officially the temp was 40F at race start. With the rain and the wind (weather app said gusts around 20mph) the feel like temp was 29F. My training was effectively 6 weeks worth and that included only one long run. I was confident that I would finish and I did, yet it was a close thing. Around mile 14 the wind picked up and when it was a tail wind it was great, but running into it was was less than enjoyable. So my performance crashed and the last mile, well, let just say if I hadn heard the sounds coming from the finish line I might not have finished. By that point I was wondering if I needed medical attention.

First, let's discuss limits to arbitrage, more commonly referred to as market frictions. The efficient market hypothesis predicts that prices reflect fundamental value. Why? People are greedy and any mispricings are immediately corrected by those smart, savvy investors that can make a quick profit. But in today's world of instant information, supercomputers and interconnected markets, true arbitrage profits earned with zero risk after all possible costs rarely, if ever, exists. Most arbitrage involves some form of cost or risk (risk of buying at the wrong price, risk of paying high transaction costs, liquidity, etc). Let's look at a simple example:

You weren overreacting that exactly what that creep was doing, which is why your intuition was warning you to get the hell away from him. He wasn concerned about you at all.

And why on earth did she leave you by yourself, as young as you were? That didn make any sense right there she should have kept you with her at all times you almost came close to being kidnapped, for goodness sakes.

I'm sure eventually it will get sorted either by one murdering the other or getting kicked out by the realestate. In my opinion the only time to involve the police is if there are young children present in the household and maybe then they will do something, but even so, unlikely.

He bluffed us all and said he went to a lawyer and I still don't believe him, I've given him two days to give us our money back otherwise I'll be going to the police station. Don't know if this was a scum move or not but $1500 is a lot of money to us so we want it back especially if someone was cheating for most of the game.
