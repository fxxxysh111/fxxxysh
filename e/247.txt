On average, an online poker game will move three times as fast as a real casino. That means your weaknesses will be magnified three times. That means the rake is three times as much.

The best one can do, most of the time, is "make a very broad guess," he says. Per the Time Lord (blogging way back in 2004):

Some may wonder why the possibility of a straight with a heart flush isn't an automatic call on the flop. While it's true that the possibility of two hearts hitting the turn and river (often called runner runner) improve your odds slightly, the odds are knocked back down by the fact that if you hit a flush, it may not be the best flush because the A is out and may be in an opponent's hand; or if you improve to two pair, you could be beat by trips. Remember, don't ever let the possibility of runner runner enter into your calculations until the first runner hits. When you need two cards to make a hand (often called a two outer), you are getting terrible odds.

A pinched nerve occurs when too much pressure is placed on a nerve from the surrounding tissues, bones, muscles or tendons. The pressure causes inflammation of the nerve, resulting in the nerve not functioning properly. No permanent damage will occur if the nerve is pinched for a short period of time, and you'll be able to function normally once the pressure is relieved.

Yeah you can make servers pay for dine and dashers, because wtf are they supposed to do? A server isn the fucking food police profiling people and watching them constantly, they are running around doing their job. If someone leaves without paying they can do much nor should they. I wouldn even chase someone who I saw doing it, not worth getting stabbed. I was a server once upon a time and the hostess seated a single probably homeless lady in my section. She ordered lamb chops and left after eating half of it. I never saw her leave, just assumed she was in the ladies room when I didn see her there anymore until it became apparent. If you want to profile and screen people who might not pay, do it yourself at the host area   don put that on a server. It not a good look for a restaurant though, since you will inevitably have false positives.

Constand, who worked as a women's basketball administrator at Temple University, his alma mater, said Cosby offered her pills and a sip of wine after she said she was "stressed" about telling the Temple coach of her plans to leave to study massage therapy in her native Canada.

When they arrive at the swamp, I want it to stand out as a dangerous area that will (literally) eat them alive if they aren cautious. So, a short way in, they discover clues of a large beast that has been knocking over trees and leaving giant footprints. Do they turn back? Hell no. They looking for ogres in the swamp! (These players were teenagers and thought "finding Shrek" in the swamp sounded like a grand adventure). Eventually, the druid decides to stand in the middle of the swamp and shout at the top of her lungs, introducing herself to the unknown monster.

No, it was a once in a lifetime thing. Grimm was filmed in Portland, OR (near me) for 6 seasons. 
No I get that. I understand you not absolved of all punishment. I just want to know why/how serial killers are allowed to claim they broken and wired wrong and unable to control their urges and serial pedophiles (who are also broken, wired wrong, and can control their urges) are not. There maybe nothing more I hate in this world than sexual crimes against children. I cannot fathom what I would be capable of if I found out someone was doing something to my daughter. If there is a hell, there no group of people more deserving to be there. I just want to know why they treated different than say a serial killer.
A public health approach emphasises prevention, it certainly provides support for people who do have problems, but the emphasis should be on prevention. A good public health approach would first of all control the supply of the product, like drugs or alcohol, and it would also regulate or manage the demand for the product. So issues about where the machines are located, issues of access that I talked about before so the way you define the problem inevitably shapes the solutions that you develop to try and address the problems.

The importance of natural plant products for cognition has been underestimated, in part because the active ingredient(s) in the plant extracts remained unknown, limiting data interpretation. In the majority of studies the compounds under investigation are a mixture of ingredients in which the most potent factor is likely to be diluted. Indeed, animal studies were often performed in aged rodents or transgenic mouse models for neurodegenerative disease [43] because compounds had minimal effects in normal young subjects [44]. However, it seems that plant polyphenols, which are the principal sources of flavanols, a subclass of phytochemicals known as flavonoids, might mediate the observed cognitive effects [42]. In cell culture, flavanols have europrotective, antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties [45]. In vivo, individual flavanols can enhance synaptic plasticity and learning [12,46]. The flavanol (!)epicatechin is of particular interest because this compound crosses the blood brain barrier after ingestion in food or drink [12,42]. Consumption of this flavanol improved retention of spatial memory in the water maze, whereas the approved AD drug memantine did not [12].

Generally, you have more 60 40s or 70 30s in this scenario when you push from lp and mostly get called by sb/bb, both calling optimally. And hence, you MIGHT have an edge long term.

Your weapons are strong, and can quickly kill the flagship as is, however killing the crew can make it safer in phase 2 and 3. On hard, the key is to use your weapons on the missile launcher and medbay if they enter with low health only, preserving as much hull as possible. Use your crew to prevent repairs and pick them off as they run for the medbay but get stuck at the hacked doors. knock down the door to the missile room. Of course a bomb is great here, but conventional weapons can work. Don take too much hull damage doing this though. If things don go well, just knock it out.

Food and candy. This can be a fun way to play poker. If you bet using small pieces of candy, you can end up with a delicious treat at the end. Though I wouldn't take the game too seriously, as people may use whatever food they have lying around. Just don't eat your winnings until the game is over!

We don't often think of sci fi geeks as the manliest of men, but they need their man caves, too. Like most man caves, the nerd sanctuary is a place to show off collections and memorabilia that might not necessarily be welcome elsewhere the house. It can certainly (and does usually) feature a big screen TV. But in other ways, the geek cave is a little different from the rest. The focal point here isn't the bar, it's the stuff: think shrink wrapped first edition comic books and X Men figurines in their original packaging. And the TV is for "Star Trek," not the Super Bowl.

Sounds like the teacher has never heard of this (or the 1A) and thought he was just being a dumbass, I remember growing up in a nice small town and being shocked at how many of my very progressive teachers barely knew anything outside the subject they taught and many of them sucked at that too, I had a teacher who when I told her "AD means domini" she told me to stop making up words. Oh and how quickly their treatment would change when they found out I was libertarian and atheist who thought their job shouldn exist. The popular vote polls were very accurate.

The hardest part is getting your raiders to understand this and not kill themselves trying to eek out every last dps they can when they could just play it safe, avoid the mechanics, and easily get a kill.

When discussing sex work, it's important to distinguish between the different types of services offered by the workers. Generally, sex work can be divided into two categories: street workers and indoor workers. Street workers are prostitutes who actively search for new clients on the street.

On the other hand, so called indoor workers may be part of an organized brothel, or they may offer their sexual services on the side in addition to exotic entertainment such as dancing or massage.
