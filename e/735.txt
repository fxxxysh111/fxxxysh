It also explains a lot about how to establish healthy boundaries and speak honestly.

Some may wonder why the possibility of a straight with a heart flush isn't an automatic call on the flop. While it's true that the possibility of two hearts hitting the turn and river (often called runner runner) improve your odds slightly, the odds are knocked back down by the fact that if you hit a flush, it may not be the best flush because the A is out and may be in an opponent's hand; or if you improve to two pair, you could be beat by trips. Remember, don't ever let the possibility of runner runner enter into your calculations until the first runner hits.

All youre doing otherwise is educating the fish while giving the general community more reason to think poker players are dull, unlikeable people.
Yes, a very important point you made Empiar. That of the social dynamics of such situations. It incredible how we tend to go to great lengths to create safeguards, protections / rules and regs about such things; only to have them stab deeper upon one trying to seek recourse or some form of being assuaged.

Several visits a day is not acceptable. One hour notice is not acceptable either. And just knocking at the door as a complete stranger is appalling. It the same "fuck you" attitude that leads to schedules being changed and information passed on at the last minute in the workplace even when things could be done differently. I say it objectively rude, not just a cultural difference. 6 points  submitted 1 month ago

2) believe it or not, jewish muslim relations were less shit than jewish christian relations historically.

Their first concern is buying a larger home. In fact, they can move up right away, Moran says. If they sell the condo for $380,000 and take off five per cent selling fees, they will net $361,000. They pay $1,736 per month on their present mortgage with a 21 year amortization. If they add $139,000 to their mortgage, payments will increase by about $800 per month, depending on the terms they select. The couple can easily support the higher payments from monthly cash savings. Carry forward rules would allow Mary to play catch up, and essentially receive two years worth of benefits if she makes two years worth of contributions. She should take the $1,500 in annual Canada Child Benefit payments that she currently holds in her TFSA and put them into a Registered Education Savings Plan and add $3,500 from cash to make the total balance $5,000. The Canada Education Savings Grant will add $500 per year to make the sums contributed $6,000. If the parents then add $2,500 per year for another 15 years to Ethan age 17 and if the contributions then attract the 20 per cent CESG for that period up to the $7,200 lifetime limit per beneficiary, then assuming that the plan grows at 3 per cent per year after inflation, Ethan will have $75,300 in 2019 dollars for post secondary education.

Gee, $600,000 seems like a reasonable salary. Especially in this economy. After all, minimum wage is going up. A Democrat controlled Congress finally managed to raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. So full time minimum wage workers will now earn about $15,000. Since $15,000 is still below the poverty level for a family, the average person might get the idea that it is completely unfair for Goldman Sachs employees to earn 300 times the poverty level and 400 times what a minimum wage worker earns.

Nearly every aspect of the orgasm   what's required to have one, why some people can't seem to achieve one, why we have them at all   has been the subject of much research and debate. What happens to the body during an orgasm is pretty well known, and it's no surprise that the brain plays a big part in reaching one. But researchers are still in the process of figuring out exactly what's happening in the brain during an orgasm. Let's start with looking at the messages that the body sends to the brain.

While he was a dangerous man with a gun, as well as with the long, bladed knife he carried, Doc was also famed as a gambler. In addition to playing cards for money, he was also a dealer for both Poker and Faro.

Patenting the WWW would have most certainly prevented it from ever becoming successful. The Web is mostly a communication standard   a contract between servers and clients for how to exchange data.

Most early Web pages did not earn money at all, they were provided by universities for free or used by companies as address book pages   here our name, our phone number, and what we do. Why would anyone have paid money for this?

The partner was threatening to sue over it all and the brother was told that they had screwed up royally and that they needed to execute the will correctly or the sister would be on the hook for all of it.

The PPP's newly discovered addiction to this mutilated Constitution is not unexpected. Given the personal trials (undeserved), and political tribulations (deserved), that the president has gone through, his affinity for a souped up version of the presidency was entirely predictable. A mutilated Constitution that validates a hyper powerful presidency has meshed perfectly with the deeply insecure model of governance adopted by the president. When presidential spokespersons express indignation at the Kerry Lugar Bill outrage as being a proxy for opposition to the president they are simply living out the structural and contextual reality of the office of president in a Pakistan that is governed by a mutilated Constitution.

As Lee Edelman points out in an essay about the Jenkins affair, "Tearooms and Sympathy: An Epistemology of the Water Closet," having gay sex meant certain death for a political career because having gay sex meant vulnerability and breached borders and that the Soviets would invade any minute. This was all the more true since Jenkins was the receptive partner in the exchange and his lover was "foreign born.".

My story isn life threatening, but I also gone through a medical lottery win, so to speak, and it was scary when it happened. Long story short I have scoliosis and had rods installed to correct it at 19. At 22, I developed a nasty infection that attached itself to the metal hardware. It required six months of continuous IV antibiotics and a wound vacuum, and ultimately resulted in removal of the metal hardware, essentially reversing the correction to my spine. Doctor that did my surgeries has corrected over 30,000 spinal deformities. I was the 2nd patient to ever have this occur.

Hopefully you don't end up short stacked too often (were you really playing correctly) and someone outdrew you on a bad call or two, but when you find yourself short, you MUST be strategizing to double up. The best way to double up is to get heads up with just one other player with a decent hand. Even if you are behind with KQos and get called with A9, you are in the right spot to double up, but not against more than one player.

And see what they advise you to do. Now, of course you can meet a dishonest manager who will let you do way more without ultimately rewarding you for it, but I believe that many managers will recognise your drive and will at the very least want to see what you capable of.In Nederland mag je vrij weinig geld inleggen in een pensioenpotje. Stel dat je 50.000 euro per jaar verdient (bruto), dan mag je in totaal 5000 euro belastingvriendelijk opzij leggen voor je pensioen.(NB Veel mensen moeten al inleggen via hun werk   zoals jij bijvoorbeeld waarschijnlijk "gedwongen" inlegt bij BeFrank   dat bedrag gaat al af van het totaal wat je belastingvriendelijk in kan leggen).Nou, als je vervroegd met pensioen wilt, dan wil je meestal per jaar wel veel meer opzij leggen dan 5000 euro van 50.000 euro bruto inkomen.Zelf leg ik daarom maximaal in in mijn pensioenpotjes (op het werk, en omdat ik daarna nog wat jaarruimte overhoud, ook nog bij een pensioenbeleggingsrekening die ik zelf geopend heb).

Mr. 
A family in my church had 12 brainwashed kids. I'm amazed they were never on the news for their shenanigans. They decided that the oldest daughter would be allowed to go to college. I was surprised at this and wanted to know all about it. She was going for business management and God had told the mother of this girl that she was going to open a "Christian family restaurant" that they would all work at. I asked what would specifically be Christian about it. She said it would have a dress code mainly for the women and only let in people who were modestly dressed. I waited to hear the rest but that was it. Sounded like a fun place. The girl ended up moving in with her boyfriend and scandalizing the family. By the time that occurred I was at a place in my evolution to feel happy for her.

I guess if he verbally said he folded before tabling his hand it is a fold, but I don understand why anyone would do that. Probably the correct but stupid ruling. Somewhat of an angle, but more just people being dumb. Another reason to just table your damn hand when this shit happens. Don even say anything just table the hand or fold if someone shows something better first. You aren becoming a jedi poker master by refusing to show hands at showdown at 1 2.

I still a little confused on the sword hate. I haven played that much since it been out, but minus the early game fight over it, it seems like a joke weapon. Every scenario, in solos and duos, we have killed it. 2v2 end game, easy win because we flew around with balloons after lasering the non sword guy. Sword just jumped around with no chance to do damage. It seems like a hopeless weapon since you have to drop everything else. I saw the video in the tournament, but it seems more like people were handing him the kills. 75 damage/swipe is strong, but doesn a tactical shotgun out DPS that? The leap has plenty of lag on the end to hit a couple shots. It not a one shot weapon if you have shield. The only thing it seems to be good for is disruption, so maybe it be solid in squads. 1 point  submitted 8 months ago
Instead of relying just on what he reads, Stout makes several trips to the construction site to speak with the workers and learn for himself what is going on.

There is a historical explanation for why Brisbane's city streets are so narrow! When Queensland became a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859, it did so with very little public money. A consequence of this was that the early CBD was developed mostly by private investors. The CBD was designed using Melbourne's Hoddle Grid as a basis, with some alterations (including the removal of 'little streets' which were not popular in Melbourne at the time.

The IMF had set meaningless quantitative targets in designing and approving the EFF programme on September 4, 2013, and has since shown great in monitoring them to help the government keep the programme operational and raise foreign exchange resources to repay its debt. As the government failed to meet even those meaningless targets, the IMF came to its rescue in each of the last five reviews of the programme. The first review was completed by giving one waiver, and the second, third, and fourth/fifth combined by giving two waivers each time. Moreover, the performance criteria that were declared to have been met were mostly based on fake statistics blindly accepted by the IMF.

Something similar happened to me on a 9 hour trans Atlantic flight. I checked in super early, and since I 6ft tall, I asked for an exit row for extra leg room and managed to get one by the window. I already boarded and seated and this couple who checked in late and didn get seats together asked me if I would switch seats with one of them and sit farther back in economy in one of the middle seats in a row of 5. They were very adamant in trying to convince me but I told them I had had a bad experience on the flight there with a child constantly banging her seat against my knees and that I specifically asked for an aisle seat for the extra leg room given my height. I told them if they really had to sit together, they could switch with someone back in the other row. Obviously, they weren willing to do that. Surprise surprise.

To be on top of your poker game is to block out everything around you and completely focus on each hand that is dealt to you.

I still SUPER new to sex, but one thing my FWB and I do that neat is we hang out and touch, get some foreplay, he gets me off with his fingers, and then we have sex. My vagina is really tight right at the opening (hence no sex ever til a few months ago   too painful and I had other shit in my life going on), so all the times we had sex without some exploratory fingers first, I bleed.

My story isn life threatening, but I also gone through a medical lottery win, so to speak, and it was scary when it happened. Long story short I have scoliosis and had rods installed to correct it at 19. At 22, I developed a nasty infection that attached itself to the metal hardware. It required six months of continuous IV antibiotics and a wound vacuum, and ultimately resulted in removal of the metal hardware, essentially reversing the correction to my spine. Doctor that did my surgeries has corrected over 30,000 spinal deformities. I was the 2nd patient to ever have this occur.

To be honest, many people still have no idea how to remember their outs. This is so important when calling a raise, checking down, or simply folding those unfortunate good hands at times.

LOL! I just don't think people outside the Midwest understand it was deadly cold out when all this was supposed to have happened. NO ONE was standing around outside in Streeterville (a nice part of town) at 2 am, waiting around with weird random objects looking for B list actors, who would likely be completely covered in hats gloves and scarves if they were out!. Pipes were bursting, cars wouldn't start, it was frostbite cold. 
Battlepass usually has 2 tiers a free one and a paid one. The free one will give you a couple shit items just so that they can say they have a free one. Then they have the paid one which usually includes items "worth" wayyy more than the asking price. The whole point of the battlepass is to keep players engaged with your game. So the more you play the further you progress the battle pass. In a BR this fills in for the lack of in game progression.

Dude. I have a really good friend who has Been on dialysis for 21 years. He has been diagnosed with liver cancer and then told he was eligible for a mulit organ transplant because of the liver. Then they told him he doesn have cancer and that his urgency for a transplant has been downgraded. Then two days ago he was told he had fibrosis of the liver but his whole system was compromised due to some edict over a month ago saying only half the fluids would be extracted during dialysis sessions leaving him run down and toxic. The hospital has been offering him transplants for over a decade only to pull the rug out from under him every time. I convinced they do not want to take him on as a transplant patient in fear he might screw up their success statistics. He lives alone and this time of year really gets to him. He thinks he going to die alone. I showed him your post. He told me that he knows how one good person in life can make a total shit sandwich better. Thank you for putting this up man.

Also zero clue on what sort of art would fit the rest of the room or your taste so just added what could be a nice layout.

On the other pole, Plato writes laughingly about the portrayal of gods in these stories. To him, the thought of gods strapping on armor and entering battle was obviously allegorical. A professor I worked with in the early 2000s, Bob Stein, always said that a sophisticated reader or listener would have understood these texts as allegories. In modern circles, this is a very common reading. But I had a professor, Jeff Shoulson, push back hard on seeing these texts only through an allegorical lens. "An allegorical reading is one way to understand these texts," he said.

That being said, it would take less time, money and effort to strengthen the judiciary than it would take to corral the military, reinvigorate civil society or rehabilitate the bureaucracy. And if indeed that succeeded, and a 'strong and fearless' judiciary did emerge, one unafraid to find the missing and speak for the dead, unafraid to challenge parallel systems of justice, unafraid to contest the usurpation of power by those clearly unqualified to wield it, why then we might have a safety net should we go into freefall. Of course since I am a woman I obviously understand nothing.
