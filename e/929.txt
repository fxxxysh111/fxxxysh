Fast forward to yesterday massage, I made a same day evening appointment for 45 minutes with him again since I was feeling extremely tense. When I walked in and he greeted me, it seemed like he was staring at my breasts, but I didn think anything of it since I wasn wearing anything revealing/form fitting. He an older man, so I chalked it up to a lazy eye sort of thing (and maybe it truly was). We got to the massage   he did my neck/shoulders/lower back from the back, and when I turned to face up, he did my neck/shoulders from the front. He also did my pecs again when I pointed to the spot of tension near my armpit. He then offered to massage my sternum again, and I think he still had me draped at that point but I definitely felt like one or both of my breasts were being exposed slightly from beneath the sheets. Again, I thought I was just imagining it and didn want to awkwardly open my eyes to check since he was right above me. Now I think he was just testing the waters to see if I would react, because he then proceeded to remove the sheets completely without asking me and left my breasts and stomach completely exposed. Only my panties and down were draped.

Then, assured of your privacy, you jam as much of your finger into your nostril as you can, pulling the finger tip forward very slightly, forming a hook. You pierce the crust of the nasal interloper ever so gently with your fingernail, for to sever it at this point would be beyond heartbreaking. You pause for a few seconds, taking a few deep breaths, aiming to truly savor the moment.

For instance, why isn there any in game progression? In his manifesto, Garfield wrote, "Many games allow the players to level their characters or their tools. Technically I believe this could be done in a non exploitive way, if the cost to level weren't open ended (or progressively more expensive making them effectively open ended). For example, if free players had a 10% disadvantage to paying players and a player could only pay one time to level   that would be a capped and probably well distributed cost to the community. In practice, leveling in a multiplayer game appears to be almost always effectively open ended and positioned to exploit addictive players.

The problem comes with Baylor vs the other playoff contenders and trying to compare their strength of schedules. To me, I would rank Utah and Clemson above Baylor if we looking at teams they have played (both Clemson and Utah have 10 P5 games scheduled compared to Baylor 9). And here where it really comes into play. Given Utah, Clemson, Baylor, OSU, and LSU all go undefeated, who would you say deserves the playoff spots? Utah (11 P5 wins), Clemson (11 P5 wins), Baylor (9 P5 wins), OSU (10 P5 wins), and LSU (10 P5 wins). I would easily leave Baylor out because it doesn matter that they put up 70 on Rice and Kansas, their schedule doesn come close. And I can guarantee you that if UCLA wins out the rest of the year and wins the PAC 12 I would put them in the playoffs over an undefeated Baylor.

4) For me, I like to always carry a sniper so I can see farther as I travel, then I like having an assault rifle in my second slot and an smg/shotgun in the third. This means as opponents get closer I wheel mouse down, and having a gun for every range is nice. I always upgrade for color, but I find the AK47 does the most damage for ARs, the Pump does the most damage for shotguns, and i like the P90 for smgs, so i prioritize those over others. I like the bolt sniper and hate the VSS (very shitty sniper). Only grab a pistol or anything gray if it the only thing you can get and upgrade immediately, Don carry two ARs, but you can pick them up because you get extra ammo. I sometimes exchange the sniper for a specialty gun, like Rubber or minigun. They sometimes seem OP against bad players but good players will kill you every time, so it depends on who you run into. Miniguns have crazy range but are easy to defend against and take forever to reload. Basically you always want a long, medium and short range weapon and 1 2 heals.

Some players use the combined odds for both the turn and river while others use them separately. If you use the turn odds on the turn, reevaluate the situation after the turn card is revealed, and use the pot odds on the river separately. The problem when using the combined odds is that you almost have to call on the turn to see the river even if you don't improve. This can lead to a dangerous mindset, and you can become a calling station. First, consider each situation by itself, and then, add in other factors.

I also don't wanna wait too long and end up giving her the benefit of filing on top of the benefit she already has of being mom.

A little word of advice in case anyone else decides to do the same thing: the laws in Georgia allow a conversation to be recorded without the other parties consent if there is no expectation of privacy, which is the case if you are in the front room of an office that has general admission. However, once you go into a private room in the back that no longer applies. So if you do try to record a conversation, make sure you stop recording before you are invited into the back should that occur.

They get frustrated with the lower increments, which slows the whole auction process to a grinding halt. They will also try and overbid a property, by changing their increments from say $100 to $500 or even $1000. This just causes them to spendmore money.

Its probably losing money when you 4bet bluff/shove these hands, because you are either flipping or absolutely destroyed by the top of their range. Try sticking to only flatting their 3bets with 22 99, its even fine to cold call a 3bet if you think the original raiser is unlikely to 4bet the 3bettor, in fact you will give the original raiser better pot odds to get into the hand which will in turn give you even better implied/pot odds to set mine. 
Then you want hand selection. Try to use hands that block your opponents premiums and value range but still have some equity when called.(In your example A2s is a better hand to bluff with than A9s because of the extra equity for the straight and you reduce the combos of Ax he can have).

The house is about 15 minutes southwest of the airport. It is reasonably close to downtown and all of the sites. The house has 4 large, clean bedrooms along with 2.5 bathrooms. Each BR has a television. We were surprised to learn that the owners lived in the basement due to no one mentioning it in earlier reviews. The freezer kept fluctuating in temperature with a small puddle as a result. I have seen scratch and dent fridges before but this one took the cake, While the front was nice, the bottom looks like it had been beaten in with a sledgehammer. The dishwasher also leaked into the owner's basement area. The front door was worked on due to it not having a doorknob and then it turned into a larger job due to a problem. The furnace failed to heat the first floor adequately and on the first cold night, we really felt it. It was also taken care of. The owner, Ambrose, is extremely attentive, kind and understanding. We arrived into Atlanta early and he had no problem with us checking in early. He kept us up to date, via text, on the problems and when they were repaired, if necessary. The washing machines were great to use and the laundry room is on the second floor!! Beds were very clean and comfortable. A nice, roomy place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. If it weren't for the problems encountered, we would probably given it 5 stars (but four is still good). The owner Ambrose, is a gentleman, and I give him 5 stars. If you have no problem with the owner and his family living in the basement, I highly recommend Ambrose's home.

So JTs might be better as a 3b bluff with a smaller sizing (maybe 2.5x?) than as a call. With like KJs or KQs you have more over cards to their pp so maybe these play better as a call. Obviously we'd have to do the math to see exactly what our best 3b are here, it might still just be better to go for raw equity with 3b, but just off the top of my head while sitting in the sauna my reasoning for raising the question is essentially this. You don't want to play a T or J on the flop really you're just dominated so often and OOP and their entire non paired range has straight outs and over cards outs. Even 99 will have back door straights often. So your real strength lies in implied odds like you said. If you hit a straight or flush or top two you're going to stack his strongest holdings often. So by 3b and cutting the SPR you're making it more likely that you will stack him if you get a strong holding while maintaining the ability to get away from marginal spots. Also it is very possible he will fold pretty much any non paired hand and maybe 99 JJ because he is so nitty I once shoved A6o for like 13bb on the button into a SB with 40bb and he showed me AK and mucked because he "didn't want to draw vs a made hand". And if UTG 4b you you have a very easy fold.

People dont like to talk about the fact that amogst all trans people, pre and post transition, or pre and post op, the suicide rate stays at a clean 40%, which tells me that transitioning solves absolutely nothing. We, naturally, want a cure, or a treatment, but we so desperate to just accept others and not ask questions, we taking the disease word for what the solution is! Theres a reason we dont handle any other illness like that, mental or physical..

I was at a 2/5 table and a new player just sat down across from me and his dad sat down at the table to play too. This guy was probably in his late 20 He was bragging a little bit about how he was a pro and plays 5/10 and bigger and was waiting for his seat at the bigger game. Anyway, I made a big bluff and he folded and I could tell he was really pissed about it. About 10 minutes after the bluff this guy is basically life tilted and talking smack to everyone at the table. He says exactly this to the player to my right who was really quiet and seemed like a nice guy. "I fuck your mother". It took me a few seconds to process what was just said and I look at him and say "Wow, if you said that to me, we have to take a walk outside" he says "Fuck your mother". I stand up, all 6 220 lbs of me and start to walk outside. He gets up and is probably 140 soaking wet. His dad immediately grabs and stops him. I keep walking and ended up just walking around the casino floor clearing my mind. I get back and security is waiting for me. They were really nice tho and I told them what happened and they sided with me but decided to just kick us both out.

You can really play loose aggressive in limit holdem, so everyone plays tight, but a tight player has more variance in limit holdem than no limit imo.

Some people think that they'd be truly happy with themselves if they had a perfect body, a high powered job, a lot of money or fame.

The Maasai don't generally have the things that people in the developed world consider to be happiness generators, such as material wealth. But they still overwhelmingly think of themselves as happy. This doesn't mean that wealthy people can't be happy   it just means that being wealthy doesn't automatically confer happiness. The same goes for any other attribute.

Eddy Martinez Esteve is a good (or bad) example of Tidrow utter inability to identify talented hitters. EME is a bust. He has a bad attitude to begin with, and he can stay healthy. When he plays he hits for neither power nor average, though he was supposed to be a stud at both.

In the US we have what's called Shopkeeper's Privilege, which says a shopkeeper or his agent may detain a suspected thief if the suspicion of theft is reasonable. It also says the detention must be carried out in a reasonable manner, for a reasonable amount of time, and only for the purpose of investigating or summoning police. It seems like everyone acted within their bounds in this situation. Shopkeeper invoked his right, police arrived and allowed the search, nothing was found, suspects were released. It worked just how it should have. However, if the suspects want to bring a civil suit, they may be permitted to by claiming False Imprisonment. IANAL but am studying for finals right now.

When you play poker games and win in actual casinos, it is also a practice to tip the dealer, and sometimes even tip some members of the audience. Part of the benefits of poker on the Web, therefore, is this: you shell out lesser money, thus, the game becomes more affordable..

A good poker table is going to be one where everyone can be seated comfortably, where the cards can move easily and which fills up the space well, and one of the best options that you might want to consider when you are looking for a good table is going to be a folding oval poker table.

He was at Repton when a boy, where at cricket he joined the remarkable and enduring roll of superb young players emanating from the school   Fry, Palairet, Ford, JN Crawford, to name a few. At Oxford he won first class honours in Classical Moderations at Wadham, and it is a tribute to his calibre as a scholar and personal force that most of the obituary articles written after the death of Viscount Simon named Fry in a Wadham trinity with Birkenhead. Not the least doughty and idealistic of his many sided achievements was as a Liberal candidate for Brighton, where he actually polled 20,000 votes long after he had ceased to live in Sussex and dominate the cricket field.

In their statements to police, both John and Paul Parmeter described how the priest's early hugs in the presbytery during music lessons gradually became something more after the priest initiated strip poker. John Parmeter described the powerlessness of a young child left alone with a priest who was his father's drinking partner and his mother's close friend, but who was also introducing sexual behaviour in secret. ''I could never at this time tell anyone that this had happened,'' Mr Parmeter told police about serious and humiliating sexual incidents at the presbytery.

Another thing I tend to look for is bet timing. There is a very general tendency for people to bet more quickly with a 3 bet/continuation bet/preflop bet with a weaker hand, and take more time with a premium hand. For example if someone immediately puts in a raise as soon as it gets round to them, because they know they will usually raise in that spot with any two cards.

Start packing non essentials right now. Literally everything but clothes, dishes, and toiletries before you actually have to. List what is inside on the outside of the boxes. Carry your clothing and toiletries separately so you can use them immediately because if you are like me, you're going to need to get ready for work the next day. If possible, load your stuff so that the most necessary items will be unpacked first and always load the bed and sheets last. You want that bed set up immediately. As long as you have clothes and somewhere to sleep on day one, everything else will work it's way out eventually.

When WWII began it was decided to keep the right arm/right hand firmly over the heart.
