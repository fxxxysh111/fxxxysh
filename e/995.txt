I went to VCU and worked in the film/TV industry for several years in Richmond. While it gave me lots of good experience, I ended up moving to Los Angeles because I wasn working often enough and there didn seem to be any room to advance my career. Because the market is so small there (usually one movie/tv series shooting at a time), certain people have a monopoly on the good paying positions and, understandably, won be vacating them any time soon.

I not saying that these Chinese guys are better than Phil. My point is that for people who have the skills to establish businesses profitable enough for them to join a 1 million buy in Euro cash game, or professional gamers who play games that involve similar skills, poker is not going to be difficult for them to understand on a deep level. Skills you learn in one area are applicable to others. Not too farfetched of a claim, no?

His mind is no doubt still lodged firmly in the 1970s and 1980s and, since he has almost certainly spent most of the time from then until now inebriated and locked away in private gatherings with other rich old men and their hired sycophants, the social and lifestyle changes in Japan have gone completely over his head. All he knows is that there exist some problems, and that there also exist people younger and poorer than him. A little simple mental arithmetic is all it takes for him to be declaring the youth of Japan the sole cause of the entire nation issues.

For your second paragraph, consider the alternative. If we say that a person level of morality is determined not by the degree to which they fall short of their maximum potential contribution, but instead by the size of their contribution in absolute terms, isn that to say that it is easier to be moral if one is powerful, and as a corollary that the powerless are morally inferior since they do not (and cannot) make a meaningful difference?. 
Appropriately, the actual game of poker is a great place to practice your poker face. In poker, if you want to win, you'll need to keep your external faade completely calm when you have winning hands. You'll also need to appear confident when you have awful hands.

Bleach is a very useful chemical both around the house and for large scale use. You can use bleach to remove stains on clothing or to whiten your laundry. It's used to disinfect surfaces, too, especially in the kitchen and bathroom. You may have tried bleach to remove mold and mildew. Hospital personnel use bleach as a disinfectant, hotels use bleach to clean and disinfect bed linens and surfaces, and restaurants disinfect food preparation surfaces with chlorine bleach. People use chlorine in swimming pools to keep the water clean and raise the pH, and in much smaller concentrations to help keep municipal water supplies free of harmful organisms. Companies sometimes add chlorine bleach to industrial wastewater to reduce odor, and chlorine is used by the glass, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, agriculture, paint and paper industries [source: Lenntech]. With its many uses, bleach its a very familiar product to most people. in 1913, for use as an institutional disinfectant and a water treatment. Clorox Chemical, later called the Clorox Company, first gave samples of bleach to consumers for household use in 1922 [source: American Chemistry Council]. Since chlorine bleach was faster and more effective than the bleaches people had been using, it quickly became the most popular household bleach. Today, when we say "bleach," we usually mean chlorine bleach. So what exactly is chlorine bleach, and how does it work?

The sheer scale of the universe is what leads most to believe there is probably life. Our galaxy has the mass of 100 billion of our suns, but probably has closer to the range of 200 400 billion stars of varying sizes. Solar systems (stars with planets) in our galaxy could be as high as 100 billion as well. The number of galaxies in our observable universe is between (on the lowest end of math using observed galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field image) 176 billion and (far more likely knowing the limits of the instruments) 2 trillion galaxies.

It depends on your interpretation of how the power is transferred. I always imagined power from Patrons is actually more like a one time bank transfer that matures over time   like in sorcerers, they don't actually get more powerful over time, they just learn how to harness power potential they already have as they 'level up'   for warlocks it's the same   the pact gives them the power, but once given they can't retract the powers given, even if the pact is unfulfilled   that's the risk the patron undergoes as a character: if the pact has not been completed (eg release uktoa for life and power) when the powers are given over, they risk the warlock running off with their already infused eldritch power. Clerics and Paladins (and to a lesser extent, druids) are a little more complicated, the powers I think are still given over, however if they deny following one god, like an oath breaker they are simply picked up by another god, the pieces of the divine game of chess are still needed by all, and they change their domain if they break their oath or turn away from their god..

Scalia was passionate about the death penalty. He wrote for the court when in 1989 it allowed states to use capital punishment for killers who were 16 or 17 when they committed their crimes. He was on the losing side in 2005 when the court changed course and declared it unconstitutional for states to execute killers that young.. 
Also there something to be very aware of if you interested. Contrary to their advertisements, they don only make money when you make money. You have to pay a 500 EUR security deposit and fully understand the terms that allow them to take it and revoke your membership. That deposit is returned to you at the completion of your contract, but the advertising is not honest in my opinion. You not simply paying a portion of your winnings, you paying 500 EUR and/or a portion of your winnings. If you are unable to become a winning poker player or if the effort required to do so is not monetarily efficient, you will be stuck for that deposit. They clearly produced winning players and I don have any inside intel on their system, but it something to understand when comparing your options.

One caution: Even a skilled player on 100 percent plus machines will have more losing sessions than winners. Those percentages assume that over the long haul the player will hit a normal share of royal flushes with full coins played. Royal flushes are expected about once every 40,000 hands   about once every 80 hours of play. There are no guarantees, however. Without a normal number of royal flushes, or if fewer than the maximum number of coins are played, the payout percentages will be lower.

Don't go wholly raw. Yes, there are legitimate reasons to enjoy raw plants in your diet, but I don't support the practice as a movement or exclusionary principle for eating. Humans have been cooking for well over a hundred thousand years. Some nutrients are enhanced by heat. Some anti nutrients (like lectins) are at least partially "disarmed" by it. Cooking methods with a mind toward maximizing overall nutrient value and bioavailability make good Primal sense and can lower your exposure to lectins.

You know, back in my day when the parents were picking up, the school literally handed out badges for parents to put in their vehicles, like a little thing to go in the dashboard with the kid name and grade. The thing had the school logo on it, and the pickup person would have the kid name in the dashboard when they were picking up. Teachers could see at a glance what kid needed to go where. Some parents would have little badges going all the way across with all the kids names they were picking up.

Y'all remember those bones we found and didn't photograph? We gave them to a funeral home owned by the family of the officer that came out of retirement to initially find them on the Avery property without getting any signatures to confirm the final hand off. No word on what they did to the bones yet, strange.We noticed that the Halbach family was going to have a funeral for their other relative that passed and thought what a nice surprise it would be for them to finally get some closure and save some money on a 2 for 1 cremation. No word on what they did to the bones and when yet, strange.Depends what the evidence bags still have in them.Taking samples of the bones is a scientific professional task that should be documented and witnessed.If I'm guessing right, when it comes out that no samples were taken the State will argue they were not exculpatory and that they were given to the funeral home for some honorable reason.
What about introverts or other less socially adept people that just don't understand it? Or can't communicate effectively with it? I sure as hell don't understand anything beyond the most obvious body language and I tend not to use it, sometimes communicating the opposite of what I mean with my body language accidentally. I'd say that requires some innate social understanding or training, which would pretty much equate to "talent".

The notion that two people should marry by their own decision and for "true love" is a fairly modern notion, it didn start to go mainstream in the west until around the 18th century.

The people involved in the marriage typically had little to say in the matter..

Your comment made me think about how DH has approached realizing what he did badly and how he made things better. I had a major concern which I voiced to our therapist that DH was going to transition from living his life to make his mother happy to doing the same to me because he only knows how to be a servant. I thought about how he speaks to me, how he approaches working on things, and it sheepish? Like he unsure of what he doing and nervous. And while that could be considered a bad thing, it positive to me that his reaction is something I never seen before and makes it seem like what he doing is entirely new and something he not experienced in because he not just approaching me like he did his mother. In the past with his mom it was cold, distant, "ok this is how I be now" or "ok this is what I do for you, happy now?". He would shut off a part of himself to serve his mother. In collecting his thoughts, taking pauses, being unsure but positive, and confusingly smiling it shows me that he trying really hard to consider all he learned in therapy and about me and trying to actually integrate it into his life rather than destroy part of his life to make me happy. The concept of compromise is very, very new to him and I think what I been seeing is what it looks like when he tries to compromise.

Like the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of a pair of dice. Since any number we roll must be either odd or even, then the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of a pair of dice is one. An odd or an even number must turn up, and that is why the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of the dice is one.

I guess King wanted the book to be about something other than just the Kennedy assassination and thought he could add some heart to the story at the same time.

Ici, j'interviens sur l'angle, pour rsumer, de la majorit sexuelle et de la possibilit pour un mineur de plus de 15 ans d'avoir des relations sexuelles avec le partenaire de son choix, avec consentement.

Gauge your sensitivity. For those of us who are most sensitive to lectins, more dramatic measures might be needed. If you know or believe that you've already suffered some serious intestinal damage, you might do well to steer clear of as many high and moderate lectin level foods as possible. That means perhaps forgoing nightshades, dairy, legumes and even nuts and eggs in addition to all grains and processed foods. dairy, etc.) and be mindful of any physiological effects (however minor) that accompany them.

I had this same problem when I wanted to adopt a dog. I work from home, so I have all the time in the world to take a dog on walks on the miles of walk able paths in my neighborhood, plus access to a dog park a five minute walk down the street, but I was afraid of getting denied simply because I couldn check the box on an application. We had a German Shepherd living quite happily with us from the ages of 10 until he passed away at the age of 16 and he had the energy of a puppy up until about his last month of life. I think other factors have to be taken into consideration when shelters adopt out dogs.

Body language tells a lot. Dasan often uses body language, expressing his needs and feelings through his actions and reactions. One of his issues is a need for pressure. He will use our Labrador retriever to show what he wants at times. Dasan will lightly press on the dog's side to let us know that he needs pressure. Pressure can be relieved by a massage, a weighted blanket or vest, a big hug or being wrapped in a blanket. If he has a headache, he will lightly bang his head with both hands.

Coconut water is naturally found inside young coconuts, and it contains a wide variety of minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, amino acids, and enzymes.It contains negligible fatty acids compared to coconut milk, which is a liquid obtained by grating the solid inside of the coconut. Coconut oil, a third health conveying food, is oil extracted from the meat of the mature coconut.Side note: Good video on Coconut oilIn a review in the journal Molecules, researchers call coconut water "a refreshing and nutritious beverage which is widely consumed due to its beneficial properties to health, some of which are based on cultural/traditional beliefs."In remote regions coconut water is well known as an oral and intravenous rehydration solution.Coconut water is famous for containing the electrolytes potassium and sodium, which are important for keeping the body properly hydrated.Potassium exists in every cell in the body, and one of its main roles is to draw water inside cells to maintain hydration.Sodium exists in the extra cellular fluid of every cell and is also involved in drawing water into the cells.An imbalance in these two minerals can cause serious problems with hydration and adrenal fatigue.Coconut water also provides a nice dose of vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, arginine, alanine, lysine, glutamic acid, and other micronutrients and enzymes that are anti inflammatory.In 100 grams of coconut water, there are about 5 grams of carbs of which half is glucose and half is fructose.Coconut water has received some negative press due to the aggressive marketing claims made by coconut water companies and because analysis of the chemical composition of the most popular varieties contained about half the sodium and 75 percent of the magnesium listed.Errors in listed ingredient content are not rare in the food industry, and the main concern with coconut water is whether it is pure or diluted since you shouldn't be relying on a beverage for all your nutrient intake needs anyway.The main advantage of drinking coconut water is that it provides extra electrolytes and antioxidants when you are training, making it useful for rehydration and great for overall health.Exercise, Hydration, and Coconut WaterRecent studies have shown coconut water is equally as effective as straight water or a carbohydrate electrolyte sport drink in replenishing fluids after exhaustive exercise, whereas word of mouth reports suggest it is far superior to water and sports drink options.The most recent study in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found no statistical difference between water, coconut water, and a sports drink on rehydration, heart rate, blood pressure, or performance from 90 minutes of exhaustive exercise in trained men.The coconut water did produce slightly better blood volume restoration than the other beverages.It's possible that the benefits of coconut water would be clinically significant on hydration status and performance if it was used for hydration regularly for a longer period rather than just one time, as in this study.Researchers note that coconut water may be preferable to sports drinks because it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup or added sugar, and the electrolytes and vitamins are naturally occurring rather than added in.Plus, it has rich antioxidant properties, which aid in neutralizing reactive oxygen species produced after endurance exercise.Antioxidant Benefits of Coconut WaterThe antioxidant content in coconut water may actually be one of its greatest benefits.It contains a wealth of micronutrients such as inorganic ions and vitamins that enhance the natural antioxidant system of the body.. 
What is the correct way? All we can do is look for ways to bring peace and love to our country. Until we can come up with a plan and get it right the first time, we have this.

You can see here that the orchestration jumps back to Step 1 after I resume the workflow. Now the Atomic Scope above may be unnecessary given that no other persistence points exist within it, so if an error occurred, it would always jump back to the Receive Shape. But, what if I added a Construct Shape and move the Send Shape to a spot earlier in the process. Now, I have ANOTHER persistence point at the top of my workflow. If I cause an error, the workflow now jumps back to the Send Shape, not all the way back to the beginning.

Excellent answer.

To be clear this was a conversation directly about Halloween and she gave some specific examples regarding dressing as celebrities.

It a huge disappointment. They went from 31 poker tables to 21 poker tables. The room is more claustrophobic than Bellagio or the main area of Commerce. They severed ties with WPT and won be hosting the Shooting Star in the spring. I don get cell coverage in the room, wifi is piss poor (can load a youtube video). They short staffed on waitresses who you must pay upfront in cash/credit card (no chips). New restaurant is nice but smaller portions and over priced. No free coffee station anymore. They upped rake in some of the games. It took them a month before the phone worked so you could call in. It was verified that the architect/designer of the room forgot to account for chairs which is why it as cramped as it is. You not allowed to have anyone on your rail (no wifey can have a glass of wine behind you while you play poker)   she be asked to sit in the lounge.

I would do terrible and I would guess the vast majority of those here would to. So much of the tasting experience in my eyes is atmosphere, what you've had to eat and how you're feeling that day. I think I could always pick out Stagg jr because of the cherry I taste in it but short of that out of the 15 or so bottles I have open now I doubt I could pin point much more.

We reported at the weekend how central bankers and investment bank analysts are increasingly discussing when this might happen. And yesterday, Italy sold a two year bond at an interest rate of  0.023%, which means investors have to pay to lend Italy money rather than receive interest on their loans. (Why would you buy such a bond? Well, if you believe that you get even worse terms in the future from other creditors hello, Sweden! then suddenly  0.023% starts to look pretty good.).

In part 1 of this series I discussed play at the beginning of a sit and go (SNG) tournament, where you should be very tight. Here we are going to talk about the theory behind the "push fold" strategy used in the middle game or "bubble" stage of a sit and go, which can be defined as the following:  There are four or five players remaining (in a ten man SNG)  The average stack size is 15 big blinds or lessUnlike the early stages, on the "bubble" of a sit and go you need to open up your game. 
Living in a nice area with expensive rent means that most likely nearby restaurants + grocery stores are more expensive as well.
Also should you have gone another round and let your stack drop to, say 40,000, another situation occurs. Lets say you pick up 2 Kings and move all in. The big blind has already invested 16000 in this pot. When the action reaches him, he has only 24,000 to call, whilst he can see 64,000 on offer in the middle. Excellent pot odds. So you will then see many of the professionals calling with unlikely looking hands such as 6,8 off suit.

The scope of the experiments and projects increased dramatically when confronted with the reality of an entire planet to use as a research lab, and that of course meant the footprint of the facilities and staff grew much larger.

Thanks for the tip! I really enjoy this conversation, and again, despite my attempts to understand and be able to describe core positions, I am at the same time deeply disturbed by attempts to censor unwanted opinions as "trolling" and unable to personally agree that small, hard forked changes like a 2x increase in block size along with segwit (if appropriately reviewed and vetted by core developers) are anathema and universally more dangerous than a high fee market.

Freerolls are hyper turbos with some good prizes including WPT seats, and MTTs are turbos that run nightly (and during sea days).

It def a fun poker environment with great dealers and nice tables/chips/cards, but maybe a past cruiser might explain better from their perspective.

A thorough walkthrough of how to build fault tolerance, resilient cloud systems on AWS. Students construct a solution made up of redundant storage in EBS, databases with RDS and DynamoDB, queues with SQS, compute with EC2, load balancing through ELB, and DNS via Route 53. Each individual module focuses on best practices and deployment guidance for deploying bullet proof, secure cloud systems. We see how to configure the application and then customize it. In the configuration oriented modules, I show you how to model data, build reports, apply security and invoke native SOAP/REST interfaces. In the customization oriented modules, I highlight how to build custom Visualforce UI screens, write custom Apex code, and develop custom SOAP/REST services.

It funny when people take the fact someone doesn like or even hates what they saying as proof that they right. It doesn mean they wrong, but it proves nothing.

People know you a dedicated Habs fan. Do they sometimes ask you to share your thoughts on the team?
One of the most interesting things about playing poker was learning the discipline of not confusing the right decision with the individual outcome of any single hand, but that's what a lot of poker players do. If they win a hand, they assume they made the right bet, and if they lose a hand, they often assume they made the wrong bet. With the coin that lands on heads a third of the time, this would be like seeing the coin land on heads once (the individual outcome) and changing your behavior so you bet on heads, when the mathematically correct thing to do is to always bet on tails no matter what happened in the previous coin flip (the right decision).
