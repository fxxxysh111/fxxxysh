I think you should give XXX another listen, because the way you characterize the lyrics on it seems pretty inaccurate.

Finally, on "30", which is in my opinion his most emotionally impactful song, he shows how desparate he is for success because he feels death is right around the corner if he doesn make enough money to escape his situation.

Subjective experience and meaning are the essence of life.

The last major revenue this state got in the last 50 years came from gaming. It's when the state started its lottery. My plan is to bring back video poker, a $4 billion industry, and tax it. I will also bring gaming to Myrtle Beach, and South Carolina could get $1 billion from the (casino) licensing alone and $2 billion in revenue. The state has been undergoing a tremendous, unimaginable amount of pain and suffering.

My strategy has always been to limp any suited cards and connectors, and limp with sub premiums such as A10, KJ, A9, low pocket pairs, etc. All of the good hands (AJ+) I will raise to either 12 or 15.

The controllers in question have little in the way of IO, save a few hardwired watchdog pulses on the embedded DI/DOs. If they do go down for a minute or two, it shouldn pose much of an issue.

Fair enough for trying to justify his selection but this is clutching at straws, even if we pretend that euro tour/floor events don count towards selection and that the World Series is remotely relevant then you can just say that Barney reaching the semi of some random exbo event in Australia has the same weighting as Whitlock reaching a ranked TV major final. Hypothetically speaking should someone reaching the World Championship + World Matchplay finals yet losing in the first round of two world series events count for the same as reaching the final of two world series events but losing in the first round of the World Champs and Matchplay? No of course not, but your scoring system grants those achievements equal weighting..

We study a very small three player poker game (one third street Kuhn poker), and a simplified version of the game that is interesting because it has three distinct equilibrium solutions. For one third street Kuhn poker, we are able to find all of the equilibrium solutions analytically. For large enough pot size, P, there is a degree of freedom in the solution that allows one player to transfer profit between the other two players without changing their own profit. This has potentially interesting consequences in repeated play of the game. We also show that in a simplified version of the game with P>5, there is one equilibrium solution if 5P . This may be the simplest non trivial multiplayer poker game with more than one distinct equilibrium solution and provides us with a test case for theories of dynamic strategy adjustment over multiple realisations of the game.We then study a third order system of ordinary differential equations that models the dynamics of three players who try to maximise their expectation by continuously varying their betting frequencies. We find that the dynamics of this system are oscillatory, with two distinct types of solution. We then study a difference equation model, based on repeated play of the game, in which each player continually updates their estimates of the other players' betting frequencies. We find that the dynamics are noisy, but basically oscillatory for short enough estimation periods and slow enough frequency adjustments, but that the dynamics can be very different for other parameter values.

The organ is one of the few that requires three lobes. Since we aren used to using three in everyday life, it doesn happen automatically.

I was issued a permanent health care card from the hospital and admitted quickly, within 15 minutes. They put me on an IV, sent me home with antibiotics and 5 others medications. It was all very streamlined and low stress, plus affordable!

The city already owns the property between the historically preserved Mother Lode and the Wheeler Opera House, and there are no specific, or even vague. 
I'm more or less in agreement with your conclusions here. As far as demographic shifts are concerned, I think the statistics you cited wrt second amendment sentiment is a symptom of the highly autocorrelated nature of political opinions, and thus their surveys. To me, the solution is to work with those who I may agree with on other issues to improve education and critical thinking regarding the second amendment. The ballot box is too late to do that   you're already voting on too aggregate a platform to send an effective message about one issue. So instead, I do what I'm doing here. I visibly demonstrate the degree to which liberalism is compatible with supporting the second amendment. "I think undocumented immigrants should be able to own guns" is a hell of a thought starter.

Also, what people never talk about with tip based employment is incentive. If I am making the same amount of money as that lazy shit of a coworker that's always on his phone, bitter to talk to, has almost no customer service skills, then why should I try to work any harder? After all, a server is part of the experience when you go out to eat. Part of the reason they're so calm when you say some condescending shit is because they're hopping for that tip. Take the tip out of the equation, there's no incentive to get your beer any faster, refill that soda, or keep my mouth shut when the customer is being a prick. People bust their ass for that tip, it's part of the culture in the States, and I think if you got rid of it you'd see a decline in quality service.

That what gets me every single day I look at the news. These people had their identities stolen and sold to a hostile foreign power who then used their identities to manipulate them into voting for a puppet administration. It sounds like it should be some 1960s scifi political cyberpunk novel, and that what makes it so effective; it just sounds so fantastical that it couldn be real and every time the point is argued with evidence all the Trump supporters have to do is revert to their safe spaces that tell them not to believe their lying eyes.

4. Slow playing too much   it gives much pleasure to be able to hide your strength and deceive your opponents, but it isn't as profitable as betting most of the time. The situation should be perfect in order to make the slow play the best possible move. For example, if you hold a pair of three's, the flop is Ace of clubs, King of spades and a 3, the pot is relatively high, and there are 5 players in the pot, slow playing isn't the best move.
If nothing else a wall would slow them down giving border patrol more time to intercept them, or funnel them into smaller unprotected areas like the hot gates.

You will learn pretty quick that the key to poker is about aggression. i say this because of this reason. wen u play tight/conservative poker, you can only win the pot by having the best hand. one thing to keep in mind is timing. all this will be learnt over time and theres no real way of explaining it because assuming your playing hold'em chances are u will never face the 7 same cards (2 in hand, 5 community) and the ones your opponents are holding, in one hand again. finally. practice. and practice. and practice. you should be playing in freeroll tournaments and play money tournaments to get the feel of a tournament structure. you should stick to playing one where u know how many people enter each time and what blind structure (blind time limits) you feel comfortable playing with your style. if you feel there are alot of donkeys going all in because its a free tournament remember it happens. the best thing u can do is sit out for the first half hour or so until they knock themselves out, then people play seriously. you should be always aiming to win a tournament and not just a place because remember when you have a chip stack over someone, you ultimately control their fate.

The fact that the Sindhi language, Sindhi culture, and Sindhi socio political discourse at large are so removed from the overarching discussions about Karachi is telling.

Where is that story in the larger national discourse? Think hard.
