Basically i would consider it 80% discipline, and 20% read. The read she had on him was probably that he was a respectable player who got it in good. 3 bet preflop basically says "I have a good hand lets gamble." Checking the flop gave a lot of it away. She would be suspecting that he either had aces, kings, queens, or AQ AK. Checking the flop after 3 betting preflop basically narrows a lot of it down. Slow Aces, or AQ or AK. Turn comes, he checks the queen, which means he either is slow playing AQ, which doesn't really make sense, or he really thinks he has a weaker hand. Bet, he calls, the information here is that he does have a hand, just not a good one. River comes an ace, she bet, check shove. If you look at the information just based on what you have it makes total sense for him to have Aces, or AQ, there's no way he has the confidence the check shove AK because he has already represented a good hand. So here are her options, she is calling for a chop, the 5% he is bluffing AK, or he has Aces. AK here has represented too much to shove confidently, so very unlikely. So really her options are call for a chop, or lose. Generally you should never call for a chop unless you are certain what they have. It's a very very disciplined fold to admit that you are beat with a boat. But given the information the dude gave away too much to check shove the river. He gets a call if he shoves straight up.

But most of the soldiers I encountered joined the military because they love their country and wanted to do what was right. They also joined to get a college degree and a better life down the road. What they encountered in Iraq (and for some reason they had all served in Iraq) was racism against the Iraqi people, religious bigotry, and even racism and religious bigotry within the military itself. They also encountered the truth that America had been "misled" (lied to) about the reasons for being in Iraq. And finally, they encountered the awful truth that they could be sent back indefinitely, that making it through one or even two tours of duty did not guarantee them freedom.

Know how to play a basic game. Video poker is simple and similar to regular poker in that you are aiming for a hand that will give you the most return. To play video poker you will tap on the cards you wish to keep or on a button on the console, and then draw cards you wish to replace. You win by having a traditional poker hand, and the amount you win is determined by the machine you are playing on.

This saloon has been running continuously for almost 100 years, 2013 marked its 100th Anniversary. The saloon is actually built from old tin tiles that were thought to have been bought from Sears and Roebuck back in 1913. one of the oldest remaining building structures in the United States that was made from these tin tiles. When you first look at it from the outside, it almost looks as if it is made from old cinder block, but upon closer inspection, you realize it is, indeed, made of these tin tiles. The saloon is both fascinating to look at and full of history.

And then there's Night Shift Lovejoy Wharf, an industrial building with the Bunker Hill bridge painted behind it. The brewery, restaurant, and cafe will open to the public on Wednesday, March 20, in the burgeoning West End neighborhood as Night Shift's most creative project to date. The brewery calls Lovejoy its innovation factory, and for good reason: One new beer will be produced here each week, with the kitchen and brewery swapping ingredients and ideas to create beers and dishes that complement each other. "When we started, one of our phrases was 'culinary inspired beers,' which is part of our DNA. On the opening beer list, patrons will find the Fixed Wing, an ale with sweet cherries, butterfly pea flower, lemon, and lemongrass; and the Living Dead, which uses molasses, pineapple, pink guava, lime, and cinnamon. The 30 tap lines at Lovejoy will include a selection of Night Shift staples   Nite Lite, Whirlpool, Santilli, and The 87  and Lovejoy exclusives, including the Lovejoy house IPA, a recipe that emerged after the brewery presented four versions to the public last year and gave them the opportunity to vote for a favorite. (Lovejoy 4 emerged victorious.)

Felonies. Yes we all know people who have them and some for really good reasons. But I don think this should be an excuse to take away your right to vote for life nor your Second Amendment rights for life. Now, hear me out. Look at all the felonies we have in this country. Is it fair that someone who commits fraud should no longer own a gun or vote? I can understand if you go in with a pistol and shoot up a 7Eleven, then I think you shouldn be allowed your weapon for a while but still, you should be allowed to vote. I think for Second Amendment rights it should be by the crime and once you have done your time, you should be on a list for like 7 or 10 years and if you don do any more crimes after that, then your right should be reinstated. We hold judgment over people even after prison which is wrong. Would you hold that same judgment on your child who just got out of time out? No. You move on and if they keep repeating the pattern you do your best to change the behavior. This is the same with prison. Some people never learn and we know this. But others do, and I think they should be given the respect they deserve. If you think about all our laws and you think about all the things that could make you a felon, then you will see what I am talking about. You could someday be in the same situation, wouldn you want dignity and respect once you came out? Wouldn you want your right to vote or have a firearm? We all would and we all should.

Usually people want any information tying their reddit profile back to their identity deleted as soon as possible.

Personally I am not a fan of people bringing up other subreddits people post in as a reason to dislike or remove their posts here. I not a Trump fan, but that is not relevant in this subreddit.

You need to accept that people may not like what you say, and either stop saying it or make your peace with that fact.

I personally like it, I think it looks a bit off right now because there are so few building at that height in the area, but as the negative space is filled with taller and thicker buildings, I think these super skinny buildings will look better. Personally, I would enjoy some more varied design among the super skinnies. But it hard to judge in a sim like this, we just have to wait and see. Varied architecture patterns through the city are what makes NY, NY. That said, I can understand the opposing opinions. Personally, I like the innovation, I don want to stay stuck in the 20th century as much as I love the architecture from that period.

Bangkok isn a superficial city, but instead a city with hundreds of years of history and development, with much of it still there, layered on top of the previous, going back as far as the 18th century, if you look deep enough. But Bangkok is also layered at the street level, in that in one street you will see a big modern mall, but if you look closer and around you see a mixture of all sorts of other kinds of street life of all levels of society and history..

But walking improves your overall health in an even more important way: If you do it briskly (at a rate of between three and five miles per hour) and continuously for at least 20 to 30 minutes, it becomes an aerobic exercise. An exercise is aerobic if you can do it rhythmically and continuously and at a brisk enough pace to force your heart and lungs to work harder to supply your major muscles with oxygen. By forcing your cardiovascular system to pump blood and oxygen continuously throughout your body, aerobic exercise stimulates and strengthens the heart, lungs, and muscles..

The persistence of the memory of pain that can last beyond its beneficial function has led to research into ways of alleviating chronic pain. Research has shown that the best way to thwart chronic pain is to prevent pain memories from forming in the first place. Anesthesia prevents the conscious mind from forming pain memories during a purposeful injury like surgery. Yet, the nervous system can still form its own pain memories. Medical professionals are finding that analgesics   drugs that prevent pain in the nervous system   given to patients before surgery prevent chronic formation of pain memory, which diminishes the development of chronic pain later on [source: Ackerman].

As sci fi action/adventure films go, Alita is suitably thrilling. Rodriguez's strengths   a strong visual sense and the ability to work in a CGI heavy environment   are in evidence. Alita looks good (even if the "preferred" 3D is superfluous), although its future interpretation of a deteriorated Earth isn't especially unique now that we've seen countless YA films with a similar vision. James Cameron's screenplay isn't a masterpiece of unique ideas   in fact, it seems oddly like a PG 13 version of the hard R rated Netflix series, Altered Carbon   but Cameron's talent has always been recycling existing stories and tropes and making something compulsively watchable out of the result (not unlike George Lucas and Steven Spielberg).

Dodds makes the case here that "respect for knowledge" is precisely what leads to Oedipus destruction, and I suspect it a reading that Nietzsche would have appreciated. Bear in mind that the Dionysian in The Birth of Tragedy is more than just strong emotion: it is also the death wish of all appearance, the yearning for the annihilation of the individual in being reunited with the primal unity underlying all of existence. 
Annie: I got asked to comeand talk about risk management. That what they really wanted me totalk about. The way that I thinkabout risk in poker isyou have some sort of estimate of whatyour edges.

Then that kindof determines how much total money youneed in terms of each individual thebest investment. I could have talkedabout that, but I felt like there werelots of people who can talk about thatvery eloquently.

Option Number One   Be your own Valentine. I know it sounds like some cheesy ass thing your Aunt Bertha would say, but hear me out. I'm not telling you to stand in a mirror like Stuart Smalley and tell yourself you're OK (I may vomit just writing it). No I'm saying this is a good time to do a little damage on you.

Come on, live a little! That's right! Happy Valentine's Day to Moi!
For some ChIP seq examples, some transcriptional activators and repressors work by binding near gene promoters and interacting with the transcriptional machinery there directly. Because of this, you would tend to annotate these proteins in relation to transcription start sites. On the other hand, there are certain proteins you would expect to be over gene bodies. These would include proteins like the RNA polymerase, and certain histone modifying enzymes (and the marks they themselves modify). There are other proteins whose expected regions of binding are a little less well defined in relations to genes. These could include proteins that bind to enhancers, and other proteins involved in 3D chromatin architecture, such as cohesin and CTCF. It may not necessarily be informative to annotate these naively in relation to gene features, but rather other higher order DNA architecture annotations would be better instead.

Take the time to ask him for his ideas and opinions next time you need to make a decision, then make sure to listen. Also, he might not realize how strong of a term "bridezilla " is. I know I was super paranoid during my wedding planning and I wasted a lot of time worrying about whether people thought I was a bridezilla. I was not a bridezilla, but I was so afraid of looking like one that I was scared to even share my opinions! Anyway, have fun with planning your wedding and make sure your fianc feels valued.

It so great when other people step up to help a woman being harassed in public. When I was a teen, I was standing at a bus stop and a man kept getting too close to me, asking me pushy questions and making me uncomfortable. Some middle aged women walking past immediately picked up on what was happening and one of them said, "Hey honey would you like to walk with us to the next stop?" Then glared at the man. I was so grateful to her. He wasn doing anything overtly threatening but he was clearly pushing my boundaries and making me uncomfortable and this lady was like, "none of that shit today, creep."

The reason people bring up circumcision so much is that unlike FGM circumcision is still widely practiced in the US. If circumcision wasn a huge problem in the US, people wouldn bring it up when you start talking about how horrible it is to chop off parts of children genitals, but as long it continues to happen on a daily basis in America you can expect Americans are going to bring it up whenever the topic of cutting healthy baby parts comes up. It would be weird if it wasn brought up..

First off, the traditional ship we think of when we think of "Vikings" is most likely a longship, the most famous example of which is preserved at the Viking Ship Museum in Norway. The Oseberg ship has is a 15 "room" ship, meaning it has 15 pairs of oars, or "rooms" for 15 pairs of rowers (30 men in all). The Norse and early English ships seem to be divided that way into "rooms," from what we know from record keeping; Alfred the Great seems to have ordered several ships of 20 rooms and there were some that were larger. In any case, the Oseberg ship is fairly well preserved and has served as a model for perceptions of Norse ships since then.

I couldn't agree more with that comment by Forward Plenty. My SO had a similar issue where his mom Grimhilde made him her emotional spouse   non stop calls, always needing him to be available, constant begging for visits (we live quite far away from her, funny that). After a while I'm like   I know your mom is important but this is really starting to cut into our personal time and I don't feel comfortable about this. Of course he went into a rage about it but I said how would you like it if I did the same to you. "I don't care!", he'd say. So I did. I fucked off every time he had to ring her. Eventually he realized that this was really messed up and so the long journey began.

The reasons they are aligned with Trump seem clear. There are many. I am not trying to debate that. But you said the idea they interfered in the election was not a legitimate one. That is the point I originally questioned. Because as I understand it many independent intelligence organizations have reached that conclusion. They have also concluded that Russia was directly involved in the DNC hack. It is not interference for them to say they prefer Trump. It is interference to hack the DNC and RNC emails, then release only one side on a slow drip over the entire campaign.

Taking a shot is different than moving up in stakes because the term "taking a shot" implies a temporary, one time attempt at moving up in stakes before having the proper bankroll to do so permanently.

Edit: I commented this below, but since people are asking. I wasn't working at the bar at 15. I was working in a separate hotel restaurant as a busser, and there was also a bar in said hotel. The management was the same for the whole place. Long story short, our hotel maintenance guy was out sick, a blizzard hit, and the one manager who couldn't tell his head from his ass was working that night. The restaurant was slow, so naturally he decided the barely 5 foot, 15 year old female was the best person to shovel the entire corner of sidewalk outside the hotel. The guy who said what he did was some drunk guy in his 40s or 50s who stumbled outta the bar while I was shovelling that side of the walkway.

This highly depends on exactly which poker variant is being played. In a simple draw of 5 cards from a deck there are 624 ways to get four of a kind. This is calculated by taking the 13 quads of each rank multiplied by the number of extra cards which can be the fifth card in the hand. The chance is increased since there are now 7 cards rather than 5 from which to form a hand. (Full Answer)

We study a simplified version of full street, three player Kuhn poker, in which the weakest card, J, must be checked and/or folded by a player who holds it. The number of nontrivial betting frequencies that must be calculated is thereby reduced from 23 to 11, and all equilibrium solutions can be found analytically. In particular, there are three ranges of values of the pot size, P, for which there are three distinct, coexisting equilibrium solutions. We also study an ordinary differential equation model of repeated play of the game, which we expect to be at least qualitatively accurate when all players both adjust their betting frequencies sufficiently slowly and have sufficiently short memories. We find that none of the equilibrium solutions of the game is asymptotically stable as a solution of the ordinary differential equations. Depending on the pot size, the solution may be periodic, close to periodic or have long chaotic transients. In each case, the rates at which the players accumulate profit closely match those associated with one of the equilibrium solutions of the game.

The Henderson City Council will vote tonight on a four month ban to prevent new massage parlors from opening and give staff time to craft new rules to crack down on prostitution in the industry.The 120 day moratorium would stop the licensing of any new massage establishments until September.The target of the new rules would be massage parlors that engage in prostitution and human trafficking.City Attorney Josh Reid said the vast majority of the city's 83 massage establishments follow the law, but there are a few "bad apples" that need to be weeded out.The current enforcement strategy focuses on issuing misdemeanor citations to individual workers caught breaking the law, whether for prostitution or any other violation of regulations. The problem businesses, meanwhile, tend to stay open, Reid said."What these establishments are doing, when the business owner gets in trouble, they just transfer the license," Reid said.
