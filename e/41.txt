The only part of this response that I don't buy at all is that the right is "calm." If you've talked to a Trump supporter, you'd know how fucking batshit crazy they are because they are completely divorced from reality. Liberals yelling about how the Trump Admin should not abuse children/babies, shaming the President for encouraging violence toward the press, colluding with a foreign enemy (along with other member of the GOP, several of whom spent the 4th of July in motherfucking Russia) is not the same as people on the right screaming about how Obama is a secret Muslim from Africa, and Hillary and the Deep State are conspiring to attack Trump, and Hillary is also running a pedophile ring out of the non existent basement of a fucking pizza restaurant. The difference is one side is making arguments from real events and the other is in the safe space of their imaginations where all sorts of mental gymnastics can confirm their beliefs.

Clothing, Footwear and Equipment   This risk factor is based on how suitable the equipment is in training and competition situations. If an individual is wearing incorrect footwear then their foot or ankle will not be protected effectively and forces placed on these areas will not be displaced efficiently increasing this person's risk of injury. For example, if a football player is wearing running shoes on a wet, slippery football pitch instead of the correct football boots then they are going to slip over. Not wearing the correct footwear increased their risk of injury. Training or competing with equipment that isn't the correct size or weight can make movements biomechanically inefficient, increasing the amount of strain placed on joints, tissues and muscles.

The broadcast in Athens of the October 14, 2010, Prix de l de Triomphe marked the debut of PMU partnership with Odie and was the first step in a chain of events that might ultimately result in PMU acquiring its first ever international subsidiary. On December 2, 2010, George Kyriakos, special secretary of state owned enterprises at the Greek Ministry of Finance, presented Odie as an example of one of numerous privatizations planned to raise a portion of the 54 billion (US$72.5 billion) required from Greece as part of the 118 billion (US$159 billion) bail out orchestrated by the IMF. The partnership between Odie and PMU and French horse racing associations could double revenues by increasing the number of races, introduce a 50/50 mix of Greek and French products, increase Odie physical network to 1,000 points of sale, and leverage PMU marketing expertise to broadcast races on a new, dedicated national television channel. Greece also planned changes to its Internet gaming laws in hopes of tapping into the estimated 4.3 billion (US$5.8 billion) Internet gaming black market.

Two individuals have taken it upon themselves to grind government to a depressingly historic halt while putting 800,000 Americans out of work, all in the hopes of enacting a singular campaign promise that a failure by design.

As my father doctor explained to me: in California, the trick is to take the elderly patient to the hospital and then you refuse to take responsibility when the hospital wants to release the patient. If there no one to help with the patient, the hospital cannot release them. Once a certain amount of time has passed   48 or 72 hours, cannot remember exactly, then the hospital will move the patient to a care facility. Sounds brutal, but that how to play it for medicare.
I get especially skeptical when events such as these are highly politicized and used as a tool in geopolitics (just like how Israel like to mention Genocide as a way to piss of Turkish government officials in times of disagreements).I read all the links you gave me and half of them are useless links where they have never mentioned why its called genocide.

Do not put words in my mouth. If you are asking me to not presume to know Sam Hyde, do not presume to know me. I actively did not call him a Nazi or a white supremacist. I said that, functionally, it does not matter whether he is or not because the shitty thing that he did supported those groups. If Sam Hyde wants to have his cake and eat it too, wants to have his opinions be confusing and nebulous and also wants to contribute to groups he disagrees with, that his right. He can do that. But the only thing I definitely know about him is that he made that donation and I don have to spend another second pondering or considering every possible nuance of his decision to know that I disagree with it. If he was trying to make a point, there were tons of other and better ways to do so. If he just made a mistake, fine. But the position and mindset he was in when he did the shitty thing that he did in no way absolves him of that shitty thing.

A large portion of Russian oil bound for Western Europe passes through Ukraine. And twice in the past decade, in 2006 and 2009, Russia has turned off natural gas shipments to Ukraine during disputes over gas prices. That in turn created shortages in some EU member nations.

These are numbers that show how strong the gambling industry is and also that it doesn't intend to stop.

Modern Macau was set up on December 20, 1999 when China incorporated it as a special administrative region.

And then, when Coney Island Democrat Pamela Harris found out the feds were on to her, she instructed witnesses to lie to investigators, according to an 11 count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn federal court.Prosecutors say Harris, 57, who was arrested Tuesday, accepted $35,000 in City Council discretionary funds for a non profit she ran before taking office   but instead funneled the dough into her personal bank account, before spending the cash on frilly things from Victoria's Secret, paying down the mortgage on her Coney Island home, and dropping $10,000 on vacations with her husband.Harris, who was elected to a two year term in 2016, refused to say whether she would step down as she left Brooklyn federal court Tuesday afternoon.Prosecutors say she forged a lease stating she was renting space for her Coney Island youth non profit Generation Gap, when in reality, she ran the group out of her own Neptune Avenue house and pocketed the funds, an indictment states.She is also accused of stealing nearly $25,000 from a federal program to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy by taking aid meant for displaced storm victims.Despite being able to stay in her Neptune Avenue home, she claimed she was displaced and forged a lease and rent receipts to collect $1,500 a month in federal emergency housing money, the indictment alleges.She also is accused of committing bankruptcy court fraud by hiding $10,000 in investments and lying about her income when she filed for Chapter 13 protection in November 2013, prosecutors say.Harris, elected to the Assembly in 2015, caught wind of the FBI investigation in 2016 and, despite her oath of office, instructed two witnesses to lie to the feds, prosecutors allege."The brazen corruption charged as a result of this investigation tramples on the very definition of a public servant," Department of Investigation Commissioner Mark Peters said in a statement.Political mentor and Coney Island Councilman Mark Treyger   who is not named in the indictment   has directed at least $65,000 in city funds to Harris's non profit since 2014, public records show.Treyger spokesman Aaron Hecht said the allegations are "serious and troubling, and are deeply disappointing if true."The cash came after the council tightened restrictions on discretionary spending in 2014 to tamp down on corruption.If convicted, Harris could face up to 30 years imprisonment for making false statements to FEMA; 20 years each on wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice conspiracy charges; and five years apiece on five other fraud charges, prosecutors said.A friend posted her $150,000 bail, and Judge Ramon Reyes limited her travel to New York City, Long Island and Albany."[Harris] has pleaded not guilty and we look forward to our day in court and an opportunity there to present the full facts," lawyer Joel Cohen said.

Jackson famously debuted this step, to gasps, during his performance of Jean on the 1983 25 anniversary TV special. Was this an act of artistic genius? Michael sister La Toya said in 2004 that a Train regular taught him the move, originally called the backslide: was this dancer Geoffrey, who was always doing the moonwalk on that show. He taught Michael how to do it. She was referring to Jeffrey Daniel, Casper Candidate and Cooley Jaxson, who had appeared on the dance show a few years earlier to perform a dance called the boogaloo. Jaxson himself later complained that the King of Pop avoided giving full credit to his teachers: kind of ended up being invisible, but we never said anything about it. true that Jackson seemed to draw on many different sources for the moonwalk. A YouTube video posted after his death shows variations of the move from Cab Calloway, Sammy Davis Jr., Fred Astaire and numerous others. And in his 1988 memoir Jackson mentions kids who taught him the basics of the street dance.

When players make mistakes because something upsets them emotionally, it is called a "tilt" or "being on a tilt." An example is a player who is a huge favorite in a hand but loses to an opponent who hits a miracle card on the river (often called a "bad beat"). That player becomes so emotionally upset that he/she begins to make bad decisions. Another instance that sometimes puts players on a tilt is when an opponent is loud, obnoxious, rude, or otherwise annoying. Players who are on a tilt react in many different ways with the most common being entering pots with weaker hands than usual and calling bets when the pot odds don't warrant it. While it's important to realize when one of your opponents is on a tilt, it is more important to realize when you may be going on a tilt and figuring out how not to let your emotions get the best of you.

It is a fact that republicans have controlled a house in the California State Legislature as recent as 1995, regardless of slim or not(They had a mere 51 in the US senate and we see how powerful that is). It doesn matter if its 50%+1 or 50%+48%, you need 50%+1 to pass legislation without a tiebreaker.Thus it is very easy to validate the claim whether or not only democrats have had a majority in both houses of the California State Legislature and if OP wanted to put a thought into knowing if person ensure then OP could have done so.

Certainly, classical thinking tells us that there are neural connections from the body to the brain through peripheral nerves, and, in particular, the vagus nerve, which provides information from the gut to the brain. Evidence that bacteria in the GI tract can activate the vagus connection to the brain comes from work showing that administering food borne pathogens, such as Citrobacter rodentium and Campylobacter jejuni, to mice activated vagal pathways and related brain regions.20, 21 This neural activation occurred in the absence of a peripheral immune response, suggesting the presence of a direct link between the bacteria in the gut and the nervous system. In a recent study, feeding healthy mice probiotics, or "good bacteria," decreased anxiety like and depressive like behaviors compared to control mice,22 while a related study showed that feeding mice probiotics activates neurons in the hypothalamus, a brain region known to play a role in stress reactivity.23 In the latter study, the activation of neurons in the hypothalamus was greater when mice were fed infectious bacteria leading to a robust peripheral immune response.

Vonk broke down the process to a few basic questions: What cards do I have? What range of cards do I think my opponent has? Given these, what is the probability I will win the hand after all cards have been dealt? And most important: given that probability, will I make money in the long run when I pay the bet?
