I used to have a wide nose and was a very happy camper (health wise), although I didn like the way it looked.

Hence Italy steamrolls in Africa with 4 divisions. If you actually station some troops in Africa, use your Navy, you can easily take the ports in Ethiopia and Libya.

Was working in a small town 9 and a half hours away from my wife and true home. I was living in Said small town paying two rents, one in the small town and the other back home. I was working about 50 hours a week and we were months behind schedule and it wasn't slowing down. The management refused to hire more workers. One night, working late again, my immediate supervisor admitted to me that he too loathed the job. After writing a note that explained how we couldn't take it any more. We left our keys and garage door openers and drove off to leave said small town. He to his home me to mine and my wife. Left my apt to be picked up later and drove straight home to my wife the next morning. Never returned to that building again.

E: /u/dellett makes a good point that Gideon Bible do differ slightly from normal bibles   at the beginning they feature a list of sections to turn to that offer encouragement in troubling times. Along with that, some folks have been asking for proof that it does lower suicide rates. I can say for certain it does, but I can point to This Study on if Religion lowers Suicide Rates that concludes "They do in the US and Russia, but it increases them elsewhere." Why Russia and the US are outliers is a great question, and some theorize that it not them, but Christianity that the outlier, since Christianity is the dominant religion in both counties. I don know if it actually lowers rates but. Again, we get the bibles free, so if the possibility exists, there no harm in trying.
For me it really drove home the disparity between the live action productions and the animated stuff. It something that been discussed to death in certain circles, but while a lot of the live action podcasts and shows have a fair amount of lgbt cast and crew, the animated side of things frequently still uses gay stuff as a "just a joke" joke that we not supposed to be offended by/annoyed with.

So, what is up and why does it matter? Scale ups, according to the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD), are defined as enterprises with average annualized growth greater than 20 per cent per annum, over a three year period, and with 10 or more employees at the beginning of the observation period. now we know. why should we care? These scale ups account for less than five per cent of all Canadian firms, but create more than 50 per cent of all new jobs. That why we should care and we should care a lot.

For this trial, prosecutors had the strategic advantage of putting Constand on the witness stand after a parade of other accusers who told jurors that Cosby had used the same tactics on them: preying on women who saw him as a mentor, debilitating them with pills or alcohol and then violating them when they were unable to fight back. 
I get so so tired of it that I start to get so exasperated as it is absolutely constant. If you call him out in front of the class, the anger behaviour takes over and you lost him. I found the best thing to do is walk up to his desk, crouch down so my face is level just over the top of his desk, look him in the eye and say have one more chance and you gone. I know you can do this. I don want to have to send you out." I say it so quietly that no one else can hear me but you better believe he can. It works so well that I usually don have to send him out for a cool down. I can reward his bad behaviour by letting him stay in the class but I also can reward it by letting him roam the halls for 20 minutes because he bored and jumpy and being an idiot and doesn want to stay in class anymore

Especially because, even for private centers that are not subject to central planning, the healthcare system strongly discourages the installation of advanced techniques in centers where they would not meet a certain number of treatments a year, they favour having few centers with lots of patients (and machines) for "second level" treatments. 
Another fact is that the traditional poker rooms are not really much in favor of offering poker gaming as it does not benefit then or fetch the same amount of profits like the other games do. In the case of online gaming, the aim is to provide a good gaming experience to the players rather than the conventional objective of profit maximization. The time charge as charged by the traditional poker rooms are often very highly quoted. Such high rakes are far beyond the reach of a common man. This is just not it, The opportunity costs incurred with respect to a traditional poker room are in fact much higher than even the already very high rakes. The traditional gaming rooms have devised a new way of profit maximization which is to remove all the poker rooms and in stead of them go on to add more and more slot machines which are ultimately likely to yield more profit than poker rooms do.

I'm American, here people are much ruder by your standards lol. People really getting butthurt about my apparent bad manners. I've also traveled around Europe and Central America where people are much more direct and less cordial. I worked in a restaurant for 3 years and people are much, MUCH ruder. Honestly, I like how you guys really care about being cordial and would love for a world in which this is common standards. I worked in the service industry so I understand not being wanted to be treated poorly and am often very cordial and thankful for people's efforts to which I receive little cordiality in response. Yet, I do believe y'all need to get off your high horses because it really isn't this universal standard as many seem to think. Arguably that sort of response to my request is rude in itself.
And I've come to notice a pattern of people simply being too afraid to be honest or they want to avoid the awkwardness that comes along with the confrontation, which I've learned from the ghosters I've met.

Part of the issue was that the B17 wasn built mainly for range and payload like other strategic bombers, it was with bigger wings and more durable construction along with a heavy dose of defensive firepower and internal armor to be able to fight through to a target and back on it own (in the sense of being part of a unit of bombers without escort), while aircraft like the B24 and Lancaster were built for long range with heavier payloads, but to do that they had to be built lighter, which meant less room for wing and armor and consequently more sensitivity to damage.

The options for more affordable education are there, they just don't know enough so a lot of kids are taking out massive loans, going to shitty schools that market themselves as good choices to naive students, choosing bad majors because recruiters and advisors promise that there's jobs, or going to overpriced private schools. Schools are pushing them to college but are often times not elaborating on that aside from "follow your passions", which often times results in people living in poverty until they give up on their passions.

At first it was a fairly technocratic arrangement, because the research institutions wanted to ensure the projects they had marked out would not be cancelled or the land repurposed. The political history of Shaja was dominated by the slow persuasion of the institutions by the increasingly complex government that they could be trusted not to do that. These days it a democratic socialist government and economy with a single chamber of representatives; these are proportional to population so the numbers of said representatives are slowly increasing over time. The Prime Minister is voted for separately, and to some extent has a position akin to presidencies in some 21st century countries of being party. Complex laws and arrangements underpin protections for the great prehistoric biomes but there is also now several centuries worth of cultural momentum behind their existence and importance to Shaja identity.

Absolutely yes.

Its not well hidden that Poe is being portrayed as a "toxic" male and needs to have faith in his commander, who seems to have and shares no plan, simply because she is a woman.

Climate changes the texture of your hair. Change in the season or a geographical shift means that you need to change your shampoo and conditioners. Medium hair cuts can alter the shape of your facial features. When hair is left open, the features look different and a high pony tail is perfect to beat the summer heat. Accessorize your hair and maintain a fall. Looks can be cultivated for casual daily wear and also formal party times.

What would happen if you found a man that was not a child? Asking appropriate questions and that kind of thing! She suffered through political turmoil in her childhood and teen years via a prison camp, and at a minimum was psychologically abused; my guess is that she was also sexually abused or at least ogled by the guards. I was so confused, and thought that perhaps he had only ever been sexually attracted to me, and had never really intended on having a real relationship with me.

Once we arrived to Jodhpur we basically slept for half the morning. Jodhpur was once the capital of the state Marwar ("Land of Death") and is nicknamed "The Blue City" because of the beautiful blue washed buildings. After getting waiting list train tickets for two days later, we took a rickshaw up to the Mehrangarh fort, originally built in 1459. Our rickshaw driver waited for us while we snuck past the entrance (not wanting to pay the inflated tourist entry fee which included a headset).
Pioneer Saloon is a fully operating saloon today and many visitors are fascinated by its colorful history and checkered, some might even say fabled, past. It seems that another famous event occurred at the Pioneer Saloon, this one happening on July 3, 1915, just two years after the saloon had opened for business. It seems that a group of prospectors, miners and other assorted.

A lot of things go through your head when you get stabbed, usually along the lines of, "There's a long piece of metal inside my body. I may require assistance to deal with this." Funny thing, though: When those thoughts leave your head through your mouth, they apparently take the form of a blood curdling scream of pants shitting terror."And for my next trick I'll make my knife disappear .

If thermonuclear reactions are to be initiated on earth, one must take into consideration that any nuclear energy released will be carried away rapidly by radiation, so that it will not be possible to keep the temperature high for a long time. Therefore, if the reaction is to proceed at all, it must proceed very quickly. Reaction times of billions of years, like those in the sun, would never lead to an appreciable energy release; we must think rather in terms of millionths of a second.

Thats if they take it out of your bones, if you do the Peripheral stem cell transplantation (the one I did) you receive a series of injections filgrastim (it was 6 for me  one each day) to increase the production of the "good stuff" they take out for the donation. Honestly, that part was the worst. I had a nurse come to my office to give me the injections so i never even missed work for that part, but it made your bones feel a little sore, like if you fell on the ice on a cold day, but as soon as you donate, that soreness goes away. The actual removal involves a needle (like giving blood) and it doesn hurt, its just boring as you have to sit still for hours (you can watch tv, I tried to sleep to kill time) as my veins in my arm were deep and hard to get to, they did a central line by my neck, which actually cut the donation time in half (yeah!) I did NOT have to stay over in a hospital after and I went to work the next day (I did wear a turtleneck to cover up the bruise from the central line) a day or two later, it was like it never happened and the person I donated to lived (at least a year, because I got his card one year later) I have no idea if he is still alive, maybe if he is, he on Reddit and he will say Hi. The bag of "good stuff" was taken in a cooler to O airport and flown to France.

I figured with all the unwanted children in foster care .? But it might be different to have the adoptive parents go to the hospital get the baby strait from birth.

The tensions that the police ops in Lyari are instigating are dangerous and widespread. They go far beyond the problems of urban decay, or ethnic ghettoisation in Karachi. The majority of Lyari is Sindhi and Baloch. It doesn take a genius to figure out that a cheap and easy route to the hearts and minds in the Sindhi countryside is through blood in Lyari. Claiming victimhood in Lyari will resonate with Sindhis across the province. This is an exceptionally opportune thing. It isn every day that Sindhis get a headline in discussions about Karachi.

And while I can speak only for myself, I know that many in the brony community also agree with me that we do not condone the pony porn. It represents a gross and serious violation of the spirit of the show, and before I misinterpreted, I not trying to aspire any deeper meaning to the show   it a good show, but at the end of the day it just a 22 minute long commercial for Hasbro toys. I just mean that the smut represents a very deep and jolting departure from what the show is supposed to be about, and many of us want nothing more than to distance ourselves from that. If nothing else, it contributes nothing constructive to the PR problem that the brony community has. A lot of us are not into that kind of stuff, but given that our interest in the show is already considered unorthodox it inevitable that non fans will derive and stereotype it into some sort of fetish.

Me continuing to support them is of course a choice; it a choice I stand by and am frankly proud of.

Then I was rewatching (binging) 30Rock and I saw when Nancy husband, Mark, moves out to New Orleans and the reason he gives is Pitt and Sharon Stone did a crap job rebuilding those Katrina homes, and he thinks that he can make a fortune down there. It like one of those awesome moments. Like when Johnny Bravo predicted 9/11, or when The Janitor in Scrubs says should be looking for Osama in Pakistan (though not as serious). This series is awesome. :))

I find it worrying, but also oddly comforting. Like we're so small and insignificant that nothing we do will ever truly matter, but that also means we shouldn't worry about problems as much as we do cause they won't affect the grand scheme of things. The vastness of the universe in comparison to our tiny existence is also exciting because of the possibility that so many things are out there somewhere, anything we could think of! we might never discover some of those things  but that curiosity, that hope of someday encountering something new, is enough drive for us tiny little humans to want to keep going..

Level 1 warding patterns and level 1 strategies for red/blue can be pre baked to some extent and applied at random during a 5 game series. Certain cheese strategies (level 2 ganks / baron or dragon sneaks) can also be attempted with some degree of randomness though this one is harder to achieve and team comp is always factor. Randomisation with juking should only work if you don believe you can out level your opponent. Also application is difficult since different juke directions rarely have equal values given other game factors.

It is too late now for that, so would be petitioners will probably have to wait two years, although commissioners noted a special election could be called.Commissioners Candice Trummell and Patricia Cox voted in favor of putting the issue on the ballot. Trummell, who proposed the move, said afterward she was "dismayed, but not surprised" by the item's defeat."I certainly wasn't surprised after I found out that behind closed doors negotiations were going on with certain members of the commission" and the brothel industry, Trummell said.Trummell said she personally opposes prostitution, but "On a commissioner level all I want is to see what the community feels about the issue."Many paint the conflict over brothels as pitting Nye's old timers, who value the lingering Old West ethos of rural Nevada, against a bevy of puritanical, family oriented newcomers.The county's population has more than doubled since 1980, to more than 36,000, with most of the increase coming in Pahrump, which is increasingly a bedroom community for commuters to Las Vegas who want to raise children away from Sin City's tawdry displays."I specifically moved out from Las Vegas to move into a safe place for my children," said Pahrump resident Susette Vitto, who also spoke at the meeting.She told the commission, "I have six children and I've got to drive down the street and I have to tell my children to look at the floor" when passing the nude club..

To translate such depth into what is a relatively young language, like English, there is sometimes difficulty getting the point across. So the recommendation is this, upon hearing unfamiliar usage of English words, use the Heart to understand the MEANING of the words, the depth of their meaning, instead of the common, surface meanings, which at first sound out of place . Please keep this in mind and heart as you peruse the following passages.Translation: in the following pages, some things might sound like bullshit. If this happens, it is the fault of the language and the reader is advised to choose to have it mean whatever the fuck they would like it to mean.Shadrach451  3 points  submitted 4 days agoI did this for a long time with the word "Segue".

"Impressive" is not the word I use to describe that kind of behavior. Imagine starting a sub and then searching other subs to find people to ban, people you can easily see have never participated in your sub, but because they hold a different opinion they must be banned, even though they not broken your rules because they don belong to or go to your sub. And it has nothing to do with "defending their rules," since none of their rules were broken in the first place by someone who never actually visited the sub.

However, water can only hold so much sugar in it at a certain temperature, so if you put then maximum amount of sugar that can dissolve in water at a temperature (called a saturated solution) and then cool it down, you may start to see some sugar crystals form. This is actually how rock candy is formed because you put in excess sugar and then cool down the solution and the sugar crystals form into the stick for the rock candy.. 
NTA. Parents who force their kids into a certain lifestyle and actually have the audacity to get mad if the kid doesn't wanna comply with their BS are absolutely stupid.

The mark 19 models can be swapped between .44 and 50ae with a barrel change, and a .357 swap requires a barrel and bolt change. Caliber specific magazines are also required. I have to take a look at mine to see if the slide is marked with the caliber, as opposed to just the end of the barrel.

Really, nothing has changed. We shouldn expect that to improve anything we believe villain has. If anything, the double flush draw now gives weaker players more incentive to bet the 2p and sets, and the combo draws more incentive to bet as well because there are tons of draws out there to scare away a better hand on the river. The downside is this adds how many hands we might reasonably expect to bet against us, as some of the more aggressive players that were better draws with that backdoor diamond draw to bet again if they did the first go. So while we didn consider them before, we do have to consider hands like Kd Qd, Qd Td, Td 9d in the mix now.

Invest some time in researching the area where you want to try your luck. Study the history of the area, visit the courthouse for old maps and records and read newspaper archives. You don t even have to go to the library, the internet allows you to research locations anywhere in the world. If you can locate the site of old fair grounds, carnivals and concerts locations or perhaps a field where auctions are held, you will often find a lot of coins that were dropped. Another way to find local historical information is to shop local antique stores for old pictures or postcards. Most old postcards have a photo of a significant locale, such as parks, casinos, festivals, important buildings and beaches which can inspire you to hunt in otherwise overlooked locations. You will find as you explore these old sites that while the buildings may have changed the land remains, hiding the treasures beneath. More lost treasures have been found by carefully research than by swinging a metal detector at random.
