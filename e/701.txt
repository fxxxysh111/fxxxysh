Had an ex who was German so his English was fairly good but not as good as mine (my first language) and he would use the word "annoying" to describe something when he meant "interesting" or "worthy of note." For example, he referred to the way that I speak (high voice) as "annoying." Another time he said that he was "annoyed" to learn that I had taken him to a vegetarian restaurant. As an inveterate people pleaser, I spent the whole week I stayed with him worried that he was displeased with every thing I did or thought about. Despite my repeated attempts to explain to him what the word really means and let him know politely that he might accidentally offend some native English speakers he kept using the word often. Needless to say, I was quite annoyed by the end of my stay.

I assume it was used as an onomatopoeia in some parts of the world, maybe a battle cry, maybe a weird first name in Mesopotamia who knows? But I know why it is used now. And it has to stop. Wandering aimlessly for centuries with no way of interacting with anyone or anything is hard enough, but knowing why, knowing that you owe this unending torture to such a disgusting practice, such a degrading act, is nothing short of hell on earth..

Once you have selected a beauty salon that completely meets your requirements and expectations, never hesitate to remain faithful to its personnel.

You haven't told us what Pablo/Palbo is using to roll the numberwith. Is it a pair of dice? A single die ? A wheel of fortune ? Let's assume he has a pair of dice. Then there are 5 possible oddnumbers that he can roll . . . 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. So there are five possible ways to get apoint. == I have a feeling that what you really want to know is:What's the probability that Pablito will win a point with (one roll and one toss).   There are 11 possible results of the roll . the numbers from 2to 12.   There are 2 possible results of the toss . . . H eads or T ails.   So there are (11 x 2) = 22 possible results of (a roll and atoss).   Out of those 22, only 5 results will win a point.   So the probability of getting a point is 5 / 22 = 22.7 percent. On a roll of the dice alone, the probability would have been 45.5percent. But if a coin toss also has to come up favorably, you cut thechance of winning in half.(Full Answer)
Meta regression analyses reported that poorer quality studies and those with a greater percentage of men in the sample had a greater effect size. Sensitivity analyses did not significantly alter the results at six months (analyses were not possible at 12 months or 24 months and beyond). There was no evidence of publication bias. Outcome measures were only broadly defined. Only one electronic database was searched and the search was resticted to published studies in English, so there was potential for language and publication biases. However, formal assessment of publication bias was conducted and no evidence was found. Validity was assessed and effects of quality on effect size were explored. It was unclear whether appropriate steps were taken to reduce reviewer error and bias in the review process. Studies were combined in a meta analysis. It was unclear whether any tests for statistical heterogeneity were conducted. The number of studies for analysis at 12 or more months were small.
In the United States, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), as amended by the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (JVTA), defines sex trafficking as "recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of an individual through the means of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of commercial sex".

Moving on to sports massage therapy in Sydney, for a person that struggles with sore muscles it can only do wonders. This style of massage will relieve you from any pain you might be dealing with, caused by undergoing too much physical activity. If you are a person who enjoys an intense workout, then such a therapy will help you prevent your muscles from soreness. 
If you can get the person with the specialty experience and that is more important, I'd make up or have him/her make up a map with traffic patterns at various times of day, so the VA can do estimates. (Pizza delivery places are good at this: you might investigate which software they use.) Google maps may also be useful for this. I do recommend that you minimally hire someone on the same continent or know how much you can flex your business hours to accommodate the VA's time zone.

The downtown casino is housed in the Higbee Building, built in 1931 as a department store. Unlike more typical casinos that have a single, expansive gaming floor and a field of free parking, the Jack Downtown is spread over four floors and patrons who drive in must park in a multi story parking garage linked to the second floor of the Higbee Building. As a result, it lacks the glamor of a grand entrance typical of a Las Vegas casino..

Also as far as weapon combinations I feel like laser plus missile combo is a waste. Lasers bypass shields completely but the missiles fare very poorly against shields. So if somebody has a build with decent armor and shields you splitting your firepower between some lasers nibbling at armor and your missiles all hitting shields and point defenses. Better from my experience to either stack one weapon type, or do a combo including high rate of fire ballistics.

The Theon Cross album is hands down my AOTY so far. He plays tuba in Sons of Kemet, so if you listened to them that will give you an idea of what his playing sounds like. The album almost feels like jazz musicians making electronic music, the tuba has a great low end, the drums played by Moses Boyd are straight in the pocket and he uses a lot of four on the floor type beats, and the sax playing by Nubiya Garcia creates some nice melodic lines on top. Highly recommend the album

A few times, I observed his vocal reaction to a neighbourhood cat trying to get into the house through an open window.

What OnThings to doFood and DrinkFamily and KidsTV GuideDigital Print EditionTHE Commercial Club in Albury will spend $3.5million adding a 300 person function room to what has become one of the largest licensed clubs in regional Australia. It will also revamp the outdoor courtyard on Dean Street to benefit members who wish to smoke and play poker machines. A third component will be to reconfigure the Elizabeth Street central foyer and enlarge the Elizabeth Room. The club, which employs 268 full time and part time staff, continues to trade well as the clubs industry prepares for the impact of poker machine restrictions planned by the Gillard government. Chief executive Bruce Duck said yesterday the proposed improvements were a case of "dealing with the future". Teilion Architects' Rob Simmons has submitted the plans to the council showing how the new lounge would be built near the Elizabeth Street entrance with the loss of 17 car parking spaces and a roadway. Mr Duck said the new function room lounge would strengthen the club's facilities and require more staff. A glass awning will cover the set down area and the construction materials will include black granite tiles. The club will install a new 21 person lift in the Elizabeth Street foyer, removing the need for wheelchair users to turn within the lift area. An extension of the Elizabeth Room will require the snooker room to be reduced from seven to five tables, but folding doors will enable the two spaces to be used together in an eight table snooker tournament. This revamp will create a general purpose function room for about 100 people. The club has parking for 823 cars and the loss of 17 will still leave the club with enough to meet council requirements.

And then in the next book, he shows up again, and it was six months between the American publications of those books, which seemed like a million years to me. So all that time I thought Gandalf was dead, and now he's back and now he's Gandalf the White. And, ehh, he's more or less the same as always, except he's more powerful. It always felt a little bit like a cheat to me. And as I got older and considered it more, it also seemed to me that death doesn't make you more powerful. That's, in some ways, me talking to Tolkien in the dialogue, saying, "Yeah, if someone comes back from being dead, especially if they suffer a violent, traumatic death, they're not going to come back as nice as ever."

Just follow these easy and quick steps and you will be surprised with the results. For faster results, allot at least thirty minutes of your time when treating varicose veins. Create a daily schedule that constitutes fifteen minutes in the morning and another fifteen minutes at night. Clean the affected area with warm sponge. Pat it dry. You then put the oil and slowly massage it into your skin. Be very gentle. Do this for at least five minutes, every single day. Soon, you will notice the difference. And before you know it, you can start flaunting those amazing legs with sexy shorts and skirts. You can also give this to your loved ones and friends. They will greatly appreciate it when they find out that you made it for them. You can use this up to one month so it is highly recommended that you put an expiration date on the bottle. Store it in a dark and cool place and make sure it is not exposed to direct sunlight. Good luck and have fun!

Catalan nationalists have shown willingness to escalate the situation to a completely economically destabilising degree and furthermore there is little to no correlation between class or right wing or liberal politics and Catalan nationalism, which represents a very broad spectrum of economic and political views.

Some states have good Samaritan Duty to Rescue laws that require you to assist in any way practical, but more to the point, people can sue for just about anything. Whether they win or not is a different matter, but the reality is it would cost them millions upon millions to fight the case, especially if they broken it up into individual suits from every victim family and survivor. The cheaper, easier, and, right or wrongly, better publicly perceived option is to simply pay out one large lump settlement and move on.. 
The elaboration likelihood model proposed by Richard E. Petty and John T. Cacioppo in 1986 is an example of self persuasion theory. It posits three forces that cause receivers to elaborate in one of two ways when processing an ad. Here the term "elaboration" implies issue relevant thinking about such aspects of the ad as its topics, arguments, implications, consequences, promises and executional elements. The two routes that receivers can elaborate on are the central and the peripheral routes.
Now relating that to my example. If you are in position against an opponent with a strong range and the flop comes 7 2 5 and your opponent checks. It would be safe to assume this flop did not hit their range so a bet would most likely cause them to fold. Hope this helps!

She also made of my brother's speech impediment when she'd force him to read out loud. He started getting migraines so bad that he had to be medicated. My mom showed some real restraint by not scalping that cunt when she called for a PT conference with the Principal, IMO. We'd been out casually a couple of times. When he arrived, I told him to make himself comfortable, and that I was going to change into something more comfy as well. Put on this really cute nightie. Nothing too revealing, really just a super soft, slinky tank dress (easy access to all lady goods). Cuddled up to him on the couch. And nothing happened. No kiss, no nothing. Lol. He texted me later saying he wish that he'd made a move, but wasn't sure if I was up for it.

I in the same boat   I thought it was childish   although I also can see the humorous side. Honestly I get the impression that V is a little childish and selfish   those are his flaws, and they more visible sometimes than some of the other members flaws. Maybe we forget that they have flaws. My bias wrecker Suga, for instance, can be too mean sometimes. They all have good qualities to counterbalance the flaws as well, of course. I love how V holds the members very close to his heart, for instance; I thinking of when he started crying when reading his letter to Jimin in Bon Voyage 2 and when he started crying when talking over his fight with Jin in Burn the Stage. 43 points  submitted 3 months ago

Having an external HDD would not fix this issue either. Disks go bad all the time OSes go corrupt all the time. I have a career because computers suck! Every app you install that has data that is important to you you have to look and see where it store the data. Make sure that location is backed up. It a PITA but loosing data is more of a PITA. Carbonite will back up all well known folders but things like HM2 might not store it data in the usual places. So make sure you are looking up on the web how to back up your database. There is normally a menu option for this and you can back it up to your my documents and then that will get backed up to Carbonite cloud. Or back it up to Google drive so it not on your machine it in the cloud. Remember fires, floods, theft makes data go away also and is stored close or in the same house.

And that the reason why we always spread our word to this very day. We have a reason on the hatred of women and minorities, and that reason is justified.

Both the video game companies and the social justice warriors, inside the company and outside of it, will get what is coming for what they have done and what they are doing. We will not stand down, and in the end, we will be victorious.

Another thing the Mohegan Tribal Police can do is investigate crimes and haul your ass off to casino jail, which they will do if you try to cheat. We may not have AI super software to help us catch con men like in Ocean's Thirteen, but remember our closed circuit porn channel that I mentioned earlier?

From there, the other dealers and I board a private shuttle bus that takes us to a secret employee entrance, all to protect us from the more unbalanced patrons. Casino dealers only deal cards (it's sort of in the name)   we don't control the cards and cannot influence the outcome of a deal, even if we wanted to.

Answer  South Carolina is broke. What this state needs is revenue. Either we can raise taxes or fees or we can have gaming. The federal government can't keep bailing (South Carolina) out. The last major revenue this state got in the last 50 years came from gaming. It's when the state started its lottery. My plan is to bring back video poker, a $4 billion industry, and tax it. I will also bring gaming to Myrtle Beach, and South Carolina could get $1 billion from the (casino) licensing alone and $2 billion in revenue.

This is the one that set me off last night, it was actually at the top of the posts yesterday, because it got so many upvotes. I actually avoided the forum during the Kavanaugh hearings for the most part, and again after a couple weeks of the Forth suicide, because SSC endorses the cultivated delusions of persecution I initially encountered after my own attack. The top portion of that post gets people (correctly) enraged, but it priming, used to slide in the second nonsensical point.
I think the best thing about the Campaign Diaries is that it explains this very well. Matt has told why these deaths have happened and in terms of just the game itself I think of it like any form of media. There are plenty of time characters I love die or dont die in tv, movies, books, etc but even if I dont like it as long as the story is good it keeps me hooked and I think the story here is awesome.

Preflop she bet, he 3 bet in the big blind and she calls. He checked the K9Qss flop which i think is questionable for AA but makes sense for KK and some other pocket pairs. She checks behind. Turn gives her a set. He checks, she bets, he calls. River brings the As and both make a full house. He checks, she bets, he shoves. There a flush and straights available. Neither of which he goes all in with. Anything with showdown value flats or folds, depending on her bet size. If he bluffing it an insane bluff. So he polarised to having either air or he has her beat.

This would actually be really cool because one of the main problems with Main stream starcraft is that they don bring enough knowledge to the commentating. While they addressing this with bringing in Gm casters (Tod, QxC, Nathanias etc.), It making it a lot harder for newer players to understand or follow what happening. In contrast, having a noob stream where they explain really basic stuff while the game is happening would be awesome. Some good casters for this(this isn a dig I just genuinely think they better at this type of casting) would be casters like Wolf, Husky, Apollo, Kaelaris, Artosis, and Tasteless. I realize that some of these casters are capable of high level casting but they are also very good at explaining little things and generating lots of hype, which would be good for newer players.

I read the comment you linked to, and the article linked by OP, and the other article you linked. I taken the time to try to understand it, and I still don I get that the woman had a tragic backstory, and was the victim of abuse, and has mental health issues. But I also see that she purposely attempted to hang a 16 month old baby, and seriously injured three innocent adults.

And fuck them for all being too fucking unmotivated to make even the tiniest changes that would improve their life. Fuck his mom for being 45 and not having a job because she still know what she wants to do and fuck his sisters both for being anxious to get jobs.

When I got back to the table, someone commented that I should keep my chip in a safer place as it looks like it could just fall out even though I was away from the table and it was deep inside my pocket.
