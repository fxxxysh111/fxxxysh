For fun, I also started reading about how the diaphragm contracts to expand the volume of the thoracic cavity, which decreases pressure, sucking in air through your nose and/or mouth as you inhale. Then there is some "elastic recoil" where the muscles go back to their previous shape, which decreases the volume, (increasing pressure) squeezing the air out like a deflating ballon, making you exhale. So roughly speaking, inhaling "actively" uses the diaphragm muscle and exhaling is just the same muscle springing back into the "original" shape. All of this is just to say that I think the inhale is the thing to not consciously control, because the exhale is more "automatic" anyway, and doesn require as much "letting go of".

Make a bluff when cards are dealt that will possibly have weakened your opponents hand. If your opponent has called on a J 7 2 flop and the turn brings a 7, then this is not a good time to bluff as any pair your opponent may hold will still be as strong as before but he probably doesn't have trip 7s. If instead of 7 the turn comes down a K, then it is not looking so good now because some one (maybe you) may have paired Ks on the flop; so they are more likely to fold Js or 7s, if you betted/bluffed as if you may now have a pair of Kings. Then if they fold, you take the pot without a showdown. But, if instead of K the turn were any lower number card, then their possible pair of J or 7 would still be looking pretty good to your opponent. And, if you bet after seeing a weak turn card, they won't likely fold, because of your playing on the weak turn card is not scary to anyone. You need to decide to fold, if your opponent raised here or for sure on the River, if you're cards are a weak or trash hand, to avoid being caught.

It funny how things have flipped. A year ago, I played mystery heroes almost exclusively, because even though I really hate the game mode (duplicates, ultimate steamroll, etc), the people playing almost never said shitty things in the chat. The rare toxic BS was always a day or two after the lootboxes reset, when all of the comp players would come in to get their loot.

EDIT: it would seem that amazon decided to have one of their "flash sales" during the time that I decided to talk about it. Unfortunately, the timer for the $55 NetGear R6700 "nighthawk" has expired. They are currently priced on amazon in my geographic region (west coast, USA) at $89.99. Still a very good price as they used to cost $150 at one point. Should also be noted that any Best Buy will price match and will likely have more than one in inventory.

For me personally, it would come down to respecting the deceased wishes. I had a close family member pass away not too long ago, and a few days before the passing, we had a frank conversation about my future and plans and goals.

There is one sure way to defeat a cheater most of the time   cut the deck. Players should be allowed to cut the deck before the deal. If you suspect cheating, feel free to cut before every hand. It is your money, after all. The favored method requires taking two separate packets of cards from the middle of the deck, putting them in a pile together, and placing the rest of the deck on top of that pile. Then, you cut the deck again. If the deck seems especially suspicious, ask for a new deck   one fresh from the plastic wrapper. This is no guarantee, however, since many marked decks are made at gambling supply houses and then resealed in the wrappers. Livingston's stories revolves around a cold deck cheater who got too ambitious. Not only was the new deck he put into the game stacked to give him a great hand, but it gave all the other players great hands, too   great enough that they'd bet their stack, but not quite great enough to beat the cheat. Everyone was suspicious off the bat (the reason it's called cold decking is because a deck in play for awhile gets warm from constant handling). Suspicions grew, and when the showdown came around, the cheater was not too gently asked if he had another deck of cards in his pocket. Looking around nervously, he admitted to having three or four. Livingston reports that the cheat was ushered away from that game without injury, but that he was shot and injured at another poker game a few weeks later.
That deal soon grew to $750 million. By the time the Borgata opened in July, 2003, it had reached $1.1 billion. Boyd Gaming and Mirage, which merged with MGM Grand in 2000 to form MGM Mirage, have brought a plush Las Vegas style hotel and casino to careworn Atlantic City.

My sources come from the book by Linguistic Professor Zhao, Jie, called ISBN 9787105084173. I definitely recommend it if you are interested in the subject. Also if you are curious about all the loan words in Mandarin, I can also recommend you another book, rather a loan word lexicon. Mandarin heavily borrows loan words from Japanese, Cantonese, and by their proxy also some western words.

I don agree with it at all because innocent people who were sick and probably could not afford a pay cut got caught in this clusterfuck. This problem ultimately comes from the high demand of agency work, as there is a huge shortage of people working in proper care as these companies often pay double rates and they steal all of the prospective workers. The agency industry seems convinient but in reality steals money off of the residents when the homes put up the prices due to agency cost.

Der Doktor schrieb in seinen Papieren, und so ganz wie nebenbei kam seine nchste Frage: "Wann haben sie sich zum letzten Mal selbst befriedigt?" Oh nein! dachte Helen, das darf nicht wahr sein, was der mir fr intime Fragen stellt. "Mssen Sie das wissen?" fragte sie zurck, vielleicht liess er sich von dieser peinlichen Situation abbringen. "Helen, wir wollen doch bei der Untersuchung keine Fehler machen und vielleicht etwas Wichtiges ausser Acht lassen. Also, antworten Sie auf meine Fragen, und zwar etwas schneller, ohne sich bei jeder Frage bitten zu lassen! Also, wann haben sie sich zum letzten Mal selbst befriedigt?".   "Gestern". Oh, wenn er jetzt bloss nicht fragt, wann das voletzte Mal, aber schon kam die nchsete Frage: "Und wie oft war es gestern?". Oh, Nein, dachte Helen, aber sie wollte jetzt darber hinweg kommen und antwortete rasch: "Drei Mal". Die Augen des Doc blickten rasch auf, streiften ihr Gesicht, eine Augenbraue zog sich leicht hoch, Helen errtete tief und senkte ihre Augen schnell, und dachte: "Was denkt er wohl von mir? Dass ich total hemmungslos und geil bin", und nochmals strich eine Welle der Rte ber ihr Gesicht. Aber Carlos nahm das alles mit grossem Vergngen wahr; seine scheue Patientin, beschmt, mit der Rte in ihrem Gesicht nochmals hbscher als vorher, ja, das gefiel ihm sehr.

I can even tell you all of the violations he was hit with (I know there was speeding, something about bumpers, exhaust noise, no plates or registration, no brake or indicator lights, etc) but it was enough moving violations that he got 12+ points on the spot and immediately lost his license for 6 months.

Elevation. Another technique to remove the swelling in your hands is by sitting on a chair facing the wall. Place your hands flat on the wall with your fingers pointing upwards. The elevated position will naturally push blood downwards, into the rest of the body and will remove pressure from the hands. You can also close your hands slowly so that the blood in the hands is forced to move and circulate, which will facilitate the faster flow of blood down to the rest of the body. You can also try moving your fingers, if clenching your fist is too difficult.

Maybe the best traveled book simply comes down to one that belongs to an aircraft pilot of 40 years experience who has been flying with a single title because that is what they had with them on their very first flight, and has become a good luck token.

By confidently announcing your raise you will be able to avoid basic mistakes like calling when you meant to raise and string betting. Make sure you always clearly announce what you are going to do before you do it.

I noticed that sometimes assumptions are made about who I would date in terms of racial preference and I wonder if anyone else has similar experiences? Myth 9: Asian guys never make the first move. 
At which point Nomad is pretty much strictly better. If the non rolling card is a Null, your attack will deal zero damage, but any rolling modifier status effects (stun etc) are still applied. When disadvantaged, you draw 2 cards, if one is a rolling modifier and the other non rolling, you disregard the rolling modifier and the non rolling card is your draw (this means that a rolling +1 and a 2X will result in you taking the 2X). 
Did we REALLY need to see that, Jose Canseco?

You dying to find out, and you want to draw out the experience as much as possible. First, you glance around furtively to verify that you don have an audience. Then, assured of your privacy, you jam as much of your finger into your nostril as you can, pulling the finger tip forward very slightly, forming a hook. You pierce the crust of the nasal interloper ever so gently with your fingernail, for to sever it at this point would be beyond heartbreaking. You pause for a few seconds, taking a few deep breaths, aiming to truly savor the moment.

Marco, when the vampires were thrown out of the city. 
I think we should find a way to make oil refining and usage pollute a lot less and use it for things that specifically need it such as plastics and other petrochemical byproducts but should switch over to renewables that would make a marginal difference when done on a massive scale such as cars. I dont see why we cant have the best of both worlds. What will we do with all the oil laying underwater/underground if we switch to 100% renewables right now? As far as I know, oil when processed, is a greatly efficient fuel. It can be stored easily with minimal decay and produces massive amounts of energy when burnt. Think of it like a videogame. Would you not harvest all the possible resources to gain an advantage if your opponent does it as well or would you willingly handicap yourself by not using this resource?

Attacking them due to their race. Isn that what the Civil Rights Movement was all about   getting us past race? Why does the left keep bringing it up, and beating everyone over the head with it? It makes people question if a post racial society really is your true intent. I contend it may not be.. 
I was looking forward to a week of waspish gossip with similarly vacuous girlfriends when my feet got tangled up while stepping out of the pedicure tub and I tripped and fell face first into a newspaper. I sought refuge from the weightiness contained therein in my imported facewash but as I lathered and erased, spawn of Satan and hence fluent in the speaking of tongues that I am, I looked into the mirror and accidentally read the newsprint backwards. Which is essentially a fancy way of saying I read about the recent ascension of Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani and Israrullah Zehri to the federal cabinet, and as a woman I find it both odious and perplexing.

What you see in the media is a statistical misinterpretation of this phenomenon. Additionally, it shows us that there is still a huge issue. Why are men more likely to be an executive? Why aren't women moving up? Signs point to it being a combination of sexism AND cultural norms. 
There are two extremes you can swing between when rehabbing and flipping a home: the "I have to have it   this house is the ONLY house" extreme, and the "Nah, something better will always come along" extreme. Both ends of the spectrum are dangerous. If you're SO invested in a house that you HAVE to have it, it will be easily read on your face. You may as well write "Take advantage of me" in felt tip pen on your forehead, while you're at it. On the other hand, if you're so preoccupied with finding the BEST deal that you sacrifice many good, profitable deals along the way, you'll not only miss out on opportunities but you'll end up too confused to think straight by the end of it all. Keep it simple: find one good deal and see it through.

My assumption is that Strang and Buting knew what constituted a violation of a defendant right, and that what Kratz said was not it which is why they didn object. If you a student of the law and you think you know better than they, then why not make this suggestion to Kathleen Zellner? It the kind of thing that, if a violation, would be brought up on appeal. Since it has not been the basis of any appeal so far, by any appellate attorney, including KZ, I assume they also don see it as a violation.
They not any kinkier from what I can overhear (though to be fair, I have zero desire to know) but it is less "bad" for lack of a better term to enjoy light bondage or the like.

This makes me think of my conversation with u/bkkgirl and I suppose that the ability to visualize things is on a spectrum, with the aphantasia types on one end and people like me on the other.

So dutifully six days a week, Kim met up with Alcantara working through a 90 minute mix of cardio (either 30 minutes of moderate climbing on the StairMaster or 10 minutes of sprint intervals) and weight training. "We kind of hit each muscle group one time a week except for legs we do twice," Alcantara told E! News. "So we'll do something like back and triceps or chest and biceps and then we'll have a day dedicated to abs. It changes a little bit from time to time, but the fundamental exercises, the things that you just need always don't change like squats, dead lifts, bench press and shoulder presses."

We laughed with them for hours. They were so interesting and so fun to hang out with, and when the bar closed at midnight, even though we should have been exhausted, we still wanted to hang out.

What does it mean to be good? You say it some sort of obvious thing. But it not. When it obvious (if something is obviously moral) the discussion is not needed. And even then, you don know. Maybe a person can be vegan and have avocado every day, excluding themselves from the chain of suffering that the meat industry personifies, but maybe it because some hundreds of acres of tropical forest have been destroyed and converted in avocado farmland and maybe just one or two indigenous communities have been displaced to do so or forced to work for mostly nothing, in any case affecting their society maybe for generations, maybe forever. There are no simple answers unless you are a six year old.
