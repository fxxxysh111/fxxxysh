It depends on how much you are examining their hand analysis and where you are in your poker journey. I think there is a lot of value to be had in a poker vlog. You can pause the video, and ask yourself at each action what you would do, and then get affirmation or see what the vlogger did and listen to their explanation as to why. Some are better at this, and some focus more on the analysis than the entertainment value. If you are going to watch Trooper or Boski, then you aren going to get more detailed explanations than someone like Brad Owen. Even then, their explanations might not be too educational, but generally the vloggers are winning poker players and there are some useful nuggets of information. LATB has some crazy action, and the best players are on the Friday stream. That being said, the plays that the Friday players do aren stuff that I would pull in the local 1/2 game.

THINGS US ARMY CAPTAIN ANDREW Shulman finds the trickiest about being a Jewish chaplain deployed to Baghdad: passing the physical fitness test, finding new congregants   "Sometimes it's Cohen who's not Jewish and Flannigan who is," he says   and strictly observing the Sabbath.

Perhaps being born into abject poverty gives the lucky ones who manage to escape a sense of steely, stubborn self determination that makes them fight every second of their existence to never have to return. Can we conceive that Pacquiao feels that he has a sacred duty to pay back for his own good fortune by being the greatest boxer he can, and then to use his fame and fortune to help his fellow countrymen get a fairer deal than he got as a child? Could that be what has driven him to the top? Why not?.

The body needs these signals to only act for a while, and to achieve this, it has enzymes to break these hormones and neurotransmitters down. Because of this, dopamine and adrenaline, when injected, only have a half life of a minute or so.There is another, more important, reason why dopamine isn used recreationally (and this goes for using serotonin instead of MDMA too).

Whisking Haitian orphans away so wealthy Americans can raise them in the Never Never Land of endless play, pirates, and, like the original Peter Pan, with a strong dose of Colonizing desires is just not a game I can participate in.

Although it can feel like you unable to stop, there are plenty of things you can do to overcome a gambling problem, repair your relationships and finances, and finally regain control of your life.What is gambling addiction and problem gambling?Gambling addiction also known as pathological gambling, compulsive gambling or gambling disorder is an impulse control disorder.

 3 points  submitted 11 months agoAs others have said, go fully into electronics to have a stronger support station. Jack of all trades, master of none right now with your split. If you put down only 4k electronics reclaimer station, you going to give your teammates a false sense of security with that weak healing.Spec at least 9k electronics and look to get at least 18k healing per second (6pc classy set gets like 30k per second)Best weapon talents that you can unlock with a 2.9k/4k/9k split are Competent/talented/free slot of choice. I like determined or predatory in the free slot.Also free tip, when using support station keep the mod on the auto revive one as it has the best heal per second but still unlocks the other mods. 1 point  submitted 11 months agoTruth is not that much, but you can hold your own and get some kills.

So I mod my SMG with all Crit Damage mods so i do double damage of my low firepower most of the timeand with weapon talent Competent you still contribute.

There are quite a few forms of massage, but maybe the preferred and generally known is Swedish Massage, which was first launched as medical gymnastics within the nineteenth century by Swedish Psychologist Pehr Henrick Ling.

Others consider that Dutch practitioner Johan Georg Mezger is the true developer of the strategies of Swedish Massage.

The problem with these life or death fights over whether objectivity is possible is they not really life and death at all.

That a myth though that contracts have anything to do with paper or signing; that just something done because it provides proof in a court.

I realize I used an anecdote to make a point. Not the best way to do that. But, I mean, everyone loves until they find a reason to stop. Animals don go "Oh you know what, I hate the way he cleans pans and doesn contribute to chores, ugh." I think it far more about violating their trust that makes them stop loving you. And I think that takes a lot more effort to make happen than a human falling out of love with you. Cats, I think, are a lot harder to earn their love. It easy to love them but violate their boundaries, unlike dogs. Dogs just don have a lot of boundaries. But if you loved someone to pieces and they just disappeared one day, you still love them even a long time later. If you saw them again after several years, you still be so happy to see them because nothing happened to change how you feel about them. (Though we can realize that them disappearing may mean that they don love us or disrespect our friendship, so then we get mad and move on)

Judging from your comments in this thread, you have a bad attitude about dating, you seem to have an inflated self worth ("I have so much more going for me in my life than most guys",) and you complain that the only women you can get to hook up with you are "so so." You probably just a normal person who thinks he more attractive and charismatic than he is; you are only pursuing women out of your league and then thinking "IT THEIR FAULT THEY NOT INTO ME!"

Boston has plenty of options while Berkshire County (which is a large, rural county in western Mass) only has dial up for the many in the county.

I was extremely insulted. It was such an ignorant comment. I converse with my clients before and after each session. Introverted people know how annoying it is when people constantly degrade you and point out how "quiet" you are, or ask why you never talk. I do talk, just not constantly.

I was talking here and there throughout the night when I had something to say. But as usual, she took command of the table, and apparently nothing I said mattered much. Needless to say, that cousin and her friends are no longer in my life.

I think everything he says is false with a ring of truth. I thought about this yesterday: he is still blaming SW.

Nearly an hour where you could have said "wait oh no I messed up badly let me do the right thing" if anything his new statement just highlights this entire thing being premeditated. So, I think with this latest "confession" some things make more sense unfortunately. Although now that I'm typing this out it doesn't, why drive the girls 40 minutes to the site before killing them? The only reason that makes more sense to me is because of the "shadows" which I realize hasn't been confirmed by anyone in LE so I guess I shouldn't keep thinking that's evidence they were still alive. Sorry for the rambling. I agree with your post about him still blaming her it's sick.

One way to consider this question is in terms of trade. Because contact (and conflict) between the Ottoman Empire and Europe was frequent during the 1500s and 1600s, trade goods from the Americas reached the Ottoman Empire relatively quickly. By the early 1600s, people in the Ottoman Empire had started smoking tobacco, a crop that originated in the Americas.

The key to easing your toothache may be in your hands rather than in your mouth. Believe it or not, rubbing an ice cube on the webbed area of your hand between your thumb and index finger can help reduce the pain of a toothache [source: Melzack, et al.]. This section of the hand is known in acupressure as the L14 pressure point, which is recognized in alternative medicine as a spot that interacts with pain in various regions of the body. While massage or pressure in the L14 region may be helpful, researchers believe that the use of ice is crucial in reducing dental pain because it causes cold signals that interfere with pain signals [source: Melzack, et. al]. To try this nontraditional treatment, gently rub ice over the L14 pressure point for five to seven minutes. You should also make sure you focus on the hand that's on the same side of your body as your toothache.
When we make decisions we regret, it influences our future brain activity, especially in the medial orbitofrontal region, the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, the areas responsible for emotions and emotion related memories in the brain. High stakes decisions increase the activity in these regions, ramping up emotional stress and clouding our attempts at clear headed thinking. Take this example: It's easier to play a high stakes game of poker if you pretend you're gambling for matchsticks instead of recognizing that the chips on the table represent a million dollars. The lower stakes don't alarm the brain quite so much, and the poker player is able to focus and make better decisions.
