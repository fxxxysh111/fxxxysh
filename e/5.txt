I think this context is important. It hard to say what would have happened had they followed his plan to a T but it probably would have had more of a shot than sitting around avoiding losing dated ships. It also pretty hard to wrap your brain around seeing people senselessly explode in those ships even with the context of knowing the western front was way more of a slaughterhouse. So maybe the plan wasn a great one anyway if it relied on suiciding people to break through.

New year eve about 5 years ago. i was up about 1600 from playing poker so about 5 minutes before midnight i decide i going to put 100 on banker on the baccarat table at midnight. so i go down to the first floor and everybody is putting on the party hats and blowing noise makers and such. 2 minutes to midnight. the baccarat table is full. all asians. they are taking their time about deciding banker or player. i ask one of them if i can play along with him on his spot. he say yes. i slam my black chip on banker. being the superstitious bunch that they are, they all put max bet on banker. 2000 each spot so there 14k on the table on banker because of me. the 10 second countdown starts and the dealer starts dealing the hand. player shows 4 banker shows 7 and stands. player draws a card. everybody is yelling 3.2.1. happy new year. the dealer draws a 4 bigger than shit giving player an 8 over banker 7. and as the noise makers are going off. people are kissing. drinking champagne. the dealers pounds the table with 2 fists and says "TIE" !!!! It took .2 milliseconds for everyone to snatch their money back and happy new years to all and to all a good night.

My point about apartheid, however, is that I argue that a pretty key component of whether or not something is apartheid is whether or not the marginalized group wants to be a member of the dominant country to begin with. In 1948, the Palestinians rejected the Partition Plan. 2006 aside, Palestinians have sought independence, and have generally called for their own homeland, whether the desire is for all of Israel to be Palestinian, as was the call in 48 or for different geographical parameters, which is typically the call today, resulting in some form of a two state solution. This is a pretty big difference from many other marginalized groups   even Turkish Kurds have begun calling for integration into Turkish society. Few Palestinians want to become Israelis, which I understand, but it does lead to a gray area with regards to citizenship and voting rights.

Radisson bills itself as the largest operator of airport hotels in Europe, with 7,000 rooms at nine airports. Five hundred of those rooms are in London at Stansted Airport, newly rejuvenated by the growth of low cost carriers.

The answer was to build the lobby around an attention grabbing, five story wine tower. The Stansted Radisson Blu offers a choice of four restaurants and and go food in the lobby 24 hours a day. Use of the hotel facilities is restricted to guests, but day rates are offered.

The universal explanation for this ever increasing workload is that it represents "good clinical practice" (GCP) and is there to support the safety of the patient and the integrity of the research. It is impossible to disagree with those aims, however this deluge of bureaucracy is in danger of having the opposite effect. We are inundated with multiple amendments, many of which are of no clinical relevance, receive information on side effects that have been known about for many years, or SUSARs (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) that are neither serious or unexpected, as well as countless clinically insignificant queries.

Back spasms can also be massaged directly by lying on your side with a rolling pin or pool noodle between your ribs and pelvis (don't put direct pressure on your ribs!) and doing slow pelvic tilts or bringing your bottom knee to your chest and back down. If you have some help, you can lie on your side with a partner's elbow between your ribs and pelvis, and do pelvic tilts and raising the upper knee toward your chest (direct your partner's elbow to the sore spot with the amount of pressure that feels effective  they are there only to do as you direct, and NOT try to play massage therapist!).

Why not go to a nursing home and visit the people living there? Here are men and women, who many times have no family close by. Just coming by and saying hi, sharing a smile, and bringing some flowers to brighten the room can do wonders. Remember that these are people's mothers, fathers, grandparents. Share your heart with them. You wouldn't believe how full your heart will feel. Or you can go by a hospital (Call first, for each hospital has different policies). You may volunteer in the children's ward, hell maybe the cardiology ward for that matter. If this idea makes you queasy, than simply donate a pint of blood. And then you can go home and watch "My Bloody Valentine"! OK, that part's definitely optional.

Other Strategies An article on the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website discusses strategies followed by four orthopedic surgeons who in many years of practice had never been sued. These physicians shared a number of characteristics and behaviors, which they recommended to their fellows: be competent; communicate well with patients, colleagues and other staff; follow the basics of patient safety and patient care guidelines; and use checklists and tickler files to avoid missing something. In addition, they suggested basic common sense: don't perform elective surgery when tired; deal with complications immediately; maintain a relationship with the patient even when something bad happened; and most important, treat patients like family.

Once had a middle aged white woman ask what the difference between two flavors of lattes were. Employee responded "Well one is caramel and one is chai, it a type of tea. If you don like strong coffee flavor it really good!" "No, I mean what is caramel." Employee sputters, trying to figure out how to explain caramel to this woman who is undoubtably the most average woman in the United States and has experienced caramel before in her 40+ years.

I asked her if she would like something else. She said she already ordered (she hadn So I made her a coffee and she fucked off. The barista kept asking me if she was rude to the woman, I had to reassure her she hadn the woman was just dumber than dog shit. I felt so bad for her.

Ross Douthat points out in today New York This grim possibility is implicit in the Rolling Stone profile that undid Gen. Stanley McChrystal last week.

The first wheels had a zero and a double zero. In 1843 a German casino removed the double zero to compete with other casinos by not screwing their customers quite so badly. American casinos took one look at their customers and put that double zero right back on there. And then added a triple zero. And in a parody of the Patriot Act over a century before the fact, they called the third zero "American Eagle" so people couldn't complain about it. U S A! U S A!
Just read this very objective assessment of what happened. It is very well written and you will definitely have a different opinion after this:Seller seems to be of the opinion that the season pass does not get activated until the ticket converted to the membership card at the membership services counter.

Thinking of grabbing an easel so you don't have to grab that checkbook to fulfill your civic duty? Think again: Not everyone with a paint by numbers set and a flair for color can cover their tax bills with a couple hours in the studio. Artists are vetted by government officials and a panel of other legit artists before they can participate in the program, and the works they donate have to meet a certain standard of quality.

In addition, keep in mind that most young artists in the TOP 50 Radio/iTunes/Spotify/etc, are put there by a strong team of promoters (the marketing needed behind this is really insane, with huge amounts of cash involved!!!). Besides, you can break into the industry, tour worldwide, and still not show up in these charts. All I want to say is, you can still have success.

My experience with that type: home schooling works well as long as the purpose is to focus heavily on academics rather than just keep your kid away from public schools because you disagree with the schools, and as long as the student has some way of socializing.

Coinciding with the European colonial period was also the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the last Islamic Caliphate. It was officially dissolved in 1924 by Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, at which point Turkey as a country went through massive reforms to secularize and be accepted as a legitimate power by Europe (with only lukewarm success, but that another topic).
Another parent once called it the Zero Zone, and when I heard that, my mind flooded with context and understanding. It was a place that existed outside of time, apart from everything I used to know and from the person I used to be. It was as if I'd been jerked out of my own shoes, out of the life I recognized. Every second was an improbable gift and an agonizing eternity. Would my baby die today? Would she die before lunch? If I left for an hour, would she die while I was gone? There was no future, no past. There was only a desperate struggle to maintain.

I think it is. You figure after all the testing, using various equipment like an MRI, ultrasound, a billion blood tests, a medical bed with meals for 4 days, and 3 different teams of doctors asking for 25k is fairly reasonable for the hospital. That equipment is very expensive, all the doctors need to be paid, and I was taking up a spot in a fairly crowded hospital. I am more upset with the fact that all of it was for something that was fairly benign and should have been caught by my regualr doctor with some simple blood tests. And i understand my insurance not wanting to pay without an itemized list as a 25k bill for mono is mind boggling.

I always wonder about the people who blame their race or racism on their inability to make connections.

Also felt a little sad about the whole experience. I really enjoy fashion, and trying on clothes used to be fun.

Rumours swirled that Marwan Barghouti, perhaps the best known Palestinian prisoner and a noted leader of Fatah's younger generation, would be included, as well as perhaps Ahmed Sadat, a respected leader of the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who has been imprisoned for almost a decade. But then superseding rumours denied that either Sadat or Barghouti would be included.

I once interviewed an old gent who grown up in that time: a Jesuit priest who had been stationed there used to give him and his classmates "Bible study", but in fact he would ask them what they learned in school that day and proceed to tell them why it was all wrong   this was possible, because the Nazis were at the time leaving the Catholic Church alone.

You can withdraw $2,000 annually from age 65 through age 71 to take advantage of the annual pension income credit.

Moral Reasoning A surgeon's moral reasoning ability may affect malpractice rates, according to an April 2008 article in "Orthopedics Today." Moral reasoning affects how a physician responds to ethical dilemmas. Such physicians might also be more likely to involve the patient in active decision making and communication, which would also tend to decrease the likelihood of a malpractice lawsuit, due to the strong relationship between surgeon and patient.

I don think anyone thinks Trump tax returns are truthful and accurate. That the point.

Divide pokers in late spring when the coldest weather is over. This can be hard work with larger specimens and you may need a large knife to cut the rootstock into sections. Replant in the garden or pot up. Pokers like deep fertile soil that isn't waterlogged in winter. They flower best when they have had copious summer rain. Pokers must be in full sun and benefit from deadheading. This prevents them setting seed and promotes more flowers. The dark wine red leaves of the smoke bush (Cotinus coggygria) stay late enough to provide a backdrop. You can also plant them close to vibrant blue and purple asters.

3. The Expert   this guy knows more about poker than anyone else at the table and likes to chit chat about poker etiquette and strategy whenever possible. He bets his low pairs hard pre flop and often does well at the table, although he also suffers some big losses on a regular basis due to his inability to adjust to table dynamics when three or four people call his 10x raise with a pair of sevens. When he's playing well, he can often cause the best player at the table trouble with his aggressive play.

Homeland Security Officer. Long story short, we were doing joint investigations with the County DA office in cracking down on child porn in 2015. We knew about this site that was being used to traffic CP. Usually, it a slam dunk. One suspect had posted his email on said site and we found a magistrate who was willing to give us a warrant. We found no CP on the suspect email address and it looked like the person using it was using various aliases. We traced the IP to a home and got another warrant. When we knocked at the door and announced ourselves, we heard banging. We were let in by one of the occupants and I found a male with bloody hands and a smashed up computer. We detained him and had a tech try to retrieve data. Unfortunately, he was unable and would have to send it to a data recovery expert. My hail Mary was to interrogate the suspect and hopefully he would admit to having CP and I could arrest him. Before I could say a word, he told me he wasn going to say shit without a lawyer and he did nothing wrong. We came and left emptied handed and I could make no arrests. I pulled strings to get that computer analyzed and they could not get anything from it. I had to close the case.

These, my friend, are not cheap tricks, mind you! Poker chip tricks have been developed through long rigorous hours of playing poker. Poker addicts have developed a method killing waiting time. Also, poker chip tricks are used to intimidate other poker players. You might have seen a player randomly rotate his stack of poker chips using a single hand. Some poker fanatics also employ magic coin tricks using poker chips. Not only is watching this very fun to look at but it is also a very serious discipline. Learning these poker chip tricks needs hours to master. A serious poker player is different from a serious poker chip tricks master. Often, the poker fanatics are also the trick players, but poker chip tricks have surpassed the mere poker game. There are even poker chip trick tournaments in the US!

The Greeks were especially attracted to the use of scented oils. In fact, Hippocrates recommended the use of body oils in the bath. In Athens, proprietors of unguentarii shops sold marjoram, lily, thyme, sage, anise, rose, and iris infused in oil and thickened with beeswax. They packaged their unguents (from a word meaning to smear or anoint) in small, elaborately decorated ceramic pots, as they still do today. However, in those times the shopkeepers were consulted as doctors, and their products were sold for a multitude of medicinal uses.

First as a parent to a teenager, my 13 yo daughter is really distant with her favorite aunt. They were always super close but now she just plays on her phone or computer when we visit. We ended up dropping her off at home so we could actually enjoy our afternoon last time we were all hanging out, just a couple of years ago she was begging to visit them. I know it sucks but I also think it is fairly normal for this age. Teenagers suck a lot of the time especially with toxic behavior being modeled by your parents.

Video Poker has become increasingly popular. It is very similar to a single line video slot game. First, we explain the difference between poker and video poker.

The only way, apart from turning off half the entire electrical system, would be to go into the E/E bay and pull three particular circuit breakers.

As /u/ctreber said simpler is better and it pretty easy to get so much power generation/storage that you don really have to worry about running out. About the only thing I do really early is put my smelter upstream of my batteries/habitat. That way when night comes the smelter doesn take the limited battery power and generation away from the research stations that I prefer to be running over the smelter. However once you can built a shuttle a quick hop to the lithium planet can get you enough lithium to mass produce all batteries you ever need.

Textbooks are a broken marketplace. The person who makes the decision (faculty) doesn pay for the product. So the normal mechanism that would cause a person to avoid buying a book (because too expensive) or buy book A rather than book B (because of cost or quality) is missing.

Every year, human traffickers generate billions of dollars in profits by victimizing millions of people in the United States and around the world. Traffickers are estimated to exploit 20.9 million victims, with an estimated 1.5 million victims in North America, the European Union, and other Developed Economies combined. Despite growing awareness about this crime, human trafficking continues to go underreported due to its covert nature, misconceptions about its definition, and a lack of awareness about its indicators. 
Despite what the neo cons like Ronald Reagan and George Dubbya told us, turning all state responsibility over to the market means that the entire country is motivated by profit and therefore operates under a value system of greed.

That last shot was literally a millimetre [away from being made]. What else can you do?"The harsh reality is that Canada could have done more; the team struggled early, and gave away a point in the second end when Bernard was light on a draw to the four foot to score two.The Swedes picked up deuces in the third and fifth ends to go up 4 2, but Canada charged back, taking advantage of Norberg misses in the seventh end (to steal two) and another in the ninth (to steal one) to go up 6 4.But the team that prides itself on sealing the deal late in games couldn't do it when it counted.

His flamboyant responses to these incidents have often been as memorable as the crises themselves. But Warne tendency to speak off the cuff about the foundation affairs was causing problems.

That said, I also rather disagree somewhat with this notion in that most of the Midwest larger cities (Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Columbus, Indianapolis, Buffalo) are already returning, driven by a combination of good bones and cheap CoL (especially by Northeastern or West Coast standards). good quality intercity rail) would help accelerate the process along. For example, Lancaster, PA, which is linked by hourly trains to New York and Philadelphia, is a wealthier town than Reading, PA, which, although the same size and of similar distance, is not.

What we were hoping to avoid was people constantly just trawling through post histories to bring up something said years ago to try and discredit a person argument today.

That frankly creepy and overly involved behavior for reddit. Seeing someone history and saying something like "hey you just posted something super racist in another sub but here you saying you not racist" wasn ever the spirit of this, but I can see that it is unclear.

So even if you are all playing the same Nash equilibrium, you could still lose because your opponents are teaming up against you (either intentionally or unintentionally).You also run into the "equilibrium selection problem" where there are multiple Nash equilibria and you might play one while the other players might play a different one. So you can simply compute a Nash equilibrium and play your part of it, because you don know if the others will play their parts of the same equilibrium. In two player zero sum games, this doesn come up because any linear combination of Nash equilibria is another Nash equilibrium.

He has been faulted for maintaining an arms length relationship with members of Congress. If only, so goes the critique, he invited them for a round of golf or dinner at the White House, opponents might be induced to become partners. Obama was also criticised for "out sourcing" the recent fiscal negotiations to Vice President Joseph Biden. Political analyst Jonathan Chait has characterised Obama's negotiating style by a dismissive term from poker: "Tight weak. the worst of all worlds   when you have a weak hand, you lose, and when you have a strong hand you fail to maximise your position."Chait claims that during the fiscal negotiations Obama needlessly squandered the gains he had amassed from his re election.

Generating substantial capital for the kids for their education and later a $30,000 gift is within their means. They contribute $200 per month to the RESP and receive the 20 per cent Canada Education Savings Grant, $480 per year, for total growth of $2,880 per year. When each child is 17, the fund will have a balance of $112,610. That will support each with an approximately $56,000 kitty for post secondary tuition and books for four years. He adds $1,250 per month. If he maintains that rate of contribution, then in 16 years when he is 55 the plan, growing at 3 per cent per year after inflation, would have a value of $702,330. That capital could generate $29,500 per year pre tax income for the next 40 years. Kate has an RRSP with a present value of $76,925. If she continues to add $1,250 per month for the next 16 years, the account would grow to $434,864 at her age 53.

Christians also want to forget morality was invented more or less by modern philosophers less than 200 years ago by thinkers like kant and mills and that they are responsible for the moral revolution that evolved to allow equality to include women, and grow to the point where legal precedence achieved. and you can say jesus would help us. why? why would the indoctrination that drug us into the dark ages and currently creates a breeding ground for delusional thinking such as that vaccinations cause autism, and that eternal life is given to those who blow themselves up(Muslims are Christians with minor differences). these are the criminals when confusion strikes. make no doubt about it. i start the list but you may get the basic jist.

What Men Want is instead content to lead with its appraisal of Ali as inept at dealing with the male psyche, and position male knowledge as the be all and end all of professional and emotional success. What the film skirts around is the fact that, for most women, being able to hear the inner thoughts of men   or, for those of the NotAllMen contingent, this film's men in particular   would be an unsurprisingly less welcome gift, never mind one likely to spur some life altering level of inspired personal growth and self reflection..

Republicans did their best to hamstring the ACA, even to their own constituents detriment. Several Republican state legislatures and governors denied the Medicaid expansion, creating a coverage gap for the poor and driving up premiums because insurers were then forced under the ACA to cover high risk patients that the federal government would have covered through the expansion. Trump then stopped subsidy payments, further driving the increase in premiums, and Republicans then repealed nearly every ACA tax on the wealthy.

A major theme throughout human history is the conflict of the two ideas, "People never change" and "People are excessively changeable". What is true? "The more people change, the more they stay the same". Without change, there cannot be a remnant of the old self either. Discarding the old husk of the self with all its good and bad is nigh impossible for most people. Thus, I really do believe that being better is a matter of change   which requires taking the hard road. An ignorant, apathetic or lazy person will not be able to take that road without help.

The policies they instituted work for them, and didn't hurt anybody they knew, mostly, so they thought it was good. 
Blinds and Antes: Given that the blinds increase as the game proceeds, one must keep in mind that it changes the fraction between what is each round and the average stack size. Therefore, this means that for one to be successful, he or she must be ahead of the blinds. This way it is easier to avoid stack falling away without causing opponents any damage or reaching that final table..

I think today, Armenians Diaspora also know that they will not gonna get what they want and because of that they are keeping alive this circlejerk. (Sorry if my grammer is bad)

Heroin and other opioids suppress the breathing reflex; in an overdose, the victim's body basically forgets to breathe.

Maybe the next one Sky runs.I really not one for romance plots in any show, I only care this time because I happen to like both Mika and Atra as characters outside of that context (and I really only cared about Lafter x Aki because it was funny honestly), but be damned if this didn make me exceedingly happy today.Atra thinking he was only hugging her because that what she taught him was quite funny, but his admission that he does really care for her and just has no idea how to show it was rather heartwarming.

It all mumbo jumbo to me. I don know anyone at the temple I go to that is awakened or really cares about their progress. It just seems like their jumping through ritualistic hoops to accrue merit that will accumulate and remove obstacles to awakening. Maybe there more to it, maybe it not really Vajrayana, but I don have the time or cash to really participate in it. Like how are you supposed to meditate on emptiness without the concentration needed for that. They have beginner yogis trying to do the impossible, giving them rituals, chants and empowerments that dont actually build hard concentration and vipassana skills that well.

You will have 9000 chips in play and the game will probably end when there is 20 big blinds on the table so make your last level be 225/450 (or 250/500 if you want to make things easy). Note that the game could end before or after that level   depends on how people are playing and whether there are any cooler hands like AK v QQ or something heads up..

With AK you get a bit more equity since you're entitled to see all 5 cards with 50% equity. That's it, you get this much of equity because you decide it preflop to see all cards. It's a preflop equity.

Dexterity provides Evasion and Accuracy. Intelligence provides Energy Shield and Mana.

History has shown, Hufbauer says, that "successive Mexican governments   including those of [presidents] Zedillo, Fox, and Pena Nieto   do retaliate." For example, although the charter of the NAFTA established a schedule that would have opened the border states of the United States to competition from Mexican trucking companies in 1995, and all of the United States to this competition in 2000, the full implementation of these provisions was delayed due to concerns about the safety of Mexican trucks and drivers. The delay resulted in much frustration for Mexico, which ultimately implemented retaliatory tariffs on products imported from the United States. did."

I was in middle school when I first got into doctor who and watched the first few series religiously, going back to classic who and buying all the novels and big finish and overpriced merchandise. I 25 now, though, and having a full time job / going through grad school kind of forced me to cool my passion. I caught all the Smith seasons and watched a few Capaldi episodes (I liked him a lot, too) but I never really got as much into it and only watched a few episodes from series 9 and 10. I think that puts me in a territory of "casual viewer"? Anyways, as a casual viewer, I loved series 11. I liked Moffat and his ultra complicated lore and even his obvious fanboyism showing through the episodes, but it kind of nice to just have an episode on and enjoy it rather than having to know all the backstory. All of the episodes from series 11 were standalones and while they kind of lack depth and character development I enjoyed the stories as themselves and appreciate that I can just turn it on even when I tired from work and have fun with pregnant dude in space or witch hunting with Allan Cummings even if I couldn catch last week episode or don know the series long arc. Series 11 definitely sparked my interest back and I really looking forward to more now.

At the end of the day; playing poker in RDR2 like the other players have bad hands is the very reason why you might be losing. Always expect the other player to have the stronger hand if you don and fold quickly if the flop is unfavourable to you.
