Magritte is not a painter." He had no interest in what the French called la belle matiere, and when he did essay it   as in a series of pseudo pastoral kitsch  classical paintings in the manner of Renoir, done during World War II   he subverted it; these hot, sluglike nudes are of a brutal vulgarity exceeded only by late Picabia, who may in fact have influenced them..

The trope of the drooling kiddie porn addict trolling for their next random victim is inaccurate. People who view child porn and have previous individual child perpetration can turn to porn after conviction as it is viewed as a less risky way to "scratch the itch" and not go back to prison. Not to say they didn use it during their offending period but after the fact it is used many times as a substitute, until they reoffend of course.

Everyone is different, I fall into the small category of people that require a minimal amount of social interaction to be happy and don feel any need to "make my mark on the world" or accomplish great things in order to feel fulfilled. You may not fall into this category however, because you stated that you have a nagging feeling that you are wasting time. That shows that you want to still accomplish things. You really need to take a look at yourself and figure out what kind of life you want to build for yourself and what would actually make you happy. If that being an active part of the community or working your way up the corporate ladder that fine, if it sitting around doing nothing constructive but having fun by yourself that also fine. That why I love FIRE, it allows you to do what you want with your time once you reach it.

I went to school (middle school through the first year of college) with a guy who ended up attempting to rob a fast food restaurant and shooting and murdering the manager who couldn open the cash register. The manager was a 23 year old who had just done a commitment ceremony with his boyfriend and they were planning on moving into a townhouse together. In school, I barely saw him because he was constantly getting suspended for fighting other students. He would have sudden outbursts in class   screaming, slamming items around the rooms, throwing desks and chairs. He shoved a teacher (who was rather elderly and should have retired years ago) and then I didn see him for a few years. I did a quick Google search to find out what he up to these days and I know he did time in prison, but it looks like he out now and changed his ways. He is coaching a kids football team and has a steady job.

In astronomy, we use a couple of coordinate systems to map the sky. One is the Celestial coordinate system. This is very much like latitude and longitude, but reversed. If you imagine the Earth was transparent, and you were sitting at the very centre of the Earth. The latitude and longitude lines crossing the Earth surface would appear superimposed on the stars, and gives you a coordinate system for the sky. There are two coordinates for this. Declination is how far "north" or "south" of the equator the star appears to be. Right Ascension is how far "east" or "west", and a Right Ascension of zero is defined as one of the points where the equator of Earth intersects the plane of the Earth orbit (the ecliptic). If you add distance to this, that gives you a 3D coordinate system.

Reduced Swelling   Massage helps to elevate swelling in the affected area. Depending on the pressure placed on the injured area massage will help to reduce the swelling. Massage stimulates blood flows because the pressure used in a massage technique compresses then releases the blood vessels and supplements a normal pumping action. This increases blood circulation to other limbs which aids lymphatic drainage. Furthermore, this increases nutrients and oxygen. This helps decrease the onset of muscle fatigue and soreness.

I've been thinking of stashing a spare set of running gear at work, so if the weather goes south in the afternoon I can use the treadmill in my building's gym (with the added bonus of not having to plan ahead for bad weather.) Problem is, the only "spare" pair of shoes I have are an older pair that are probably past their mileage lifespan. Is it a bad idea to use them as emergency back up shoes? If I start using the treadmill regularly I'll consider getting a new pair just to use there, but for now I want to just use what I have. Your thoughts/opinions?. 
Of course, this argument isn going to win most people over, so your best course of strategy is to use that as a means of generating some sort of compromise..

I'm sorry, but I simply know more about finance and politics than you do. I've read more, I've studied more, and I care more.

You probably don't even know who that is. I've read Keynes. I've read Smith. I've read Veblen (have fun slogging through that). I've read Marx.

Sef started slowing down back in Nov 2016. At first we thought he twisted something in his leg, but the lameness progressed. Then we thought it was a slipped disk in his neck that was compressing some nerves. It turned out to be a nerve sheath tumor. But he was getting old, and he had arthritis and diabetes insipidus (which meant he drank a lot and peed a lot), so it got harder and harder to get around. His bladder was failing him, and it got harder and harder to get in and out of bed or up on the couch. Then in Feb of this year we got another scare when his liver values skyrocketed and the vet though we only had a few weeks left. Somehow he recovered from that (I thank CBD oil) and we got a good 6 more months with him.

Lets say that you are holding a king of spades and a 5 of spades, now you have limped in to a flop with with 6 guys involved and that reads 5 diamonds Ace of spades and 10 of spades, you already start to calculate your chances, since you have a pair of fives with a king kicker as well as a flush draw you can now count 14 cards that if one lands you have a stronger hand, and with a pair of fives you find yourself behind and pair greater than 6 and since there is both a 10 and an Ace on the table chances are with the 12 other pocket cards on the table that there is one, if there where only two people playing your odds would be less, now lets look at your chances, with those 14 out 2 of them will give you a trip that a 1 in 23.5 chance, 3 of them will give you two pair, that a 1 in 15.6 chance and for the flush you have a 1 in 5.2 chance, simply put one in every 5.2 cards dropped will give you a flush, and since you have 2 cards to come you chances here are good, all in all with the 14 outs you have a 1 in 3.35 chance, even better. this is simply calculated by taking the number of outs 14 and chancing them of against the 47 cards that you can see so a 14 in 47 chance or simplified 1 in 3.35

Amateurs in general play too many hands (they are too loose) and they don't take enough initiative (they are too passive). This is mostly because it is too boring to sit there folding hand after hand, and it is too scary to risk more money when you don't know for sure you are going to win. In general, therefore, it is recommended to play a tighter more aggressive style: play fewer hands and take the initiative..

Though a certain Amish lady makes the cop want to stick around, John Book knows that he ultimately can't fit in completely. But what if he had? What if there had been the need for a sequel, detailing how a man who's been living with the Amish becomes reacquainted with modern day society?

Maybe Pacquiao is thinking about this. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise that he's in Europe with his family on an extended vacation so he can mull over the immediate future of his career. Maybe it's time that Pacquiao show Bob a thing or two about being a businessman and show his promoter what he'd be missing if he doesn't make the fight that Manny wants.

The son of a truck driver, David Ulliott was born in Kingston upon Hull on April 4 1954 and brought up in a council house where he shared a bedroom with his sister. He did not get on with his father, claiming that he thought his name was up until he was about 14. He left school aged 15 with no qualifications to take a job at a Hull trophy makers, recalling that lunchtime I play the guys at cards and I found I could quickly calculate the odds The following year his father kicked him out of the family home: think he got fed up of me coming home at 7am after playing cards all night with more money in my pockets than he had as he went to work. Soon afterwards Ulliott was fired from his job for taking an afternoon off to go to the races.

Ok, guys. I want to respond to some questions you brought. First, please know I'm neither Bitcoin maximalist nor Monero maximalist. I'm not a die hard fan of any coin. Simple as that. I don't make up the facts. Bitcoin is not fungible. Even Monero has a questionable fungibility. Why you pretend like we have a perfect economical medium as a cryptocurrency already? NANO screwed more since it has only one ability and that's dismissed by being not fungible. Moreover, LN can provide fungibility, depends on the implementation.

No longer just an Internet directory or a search engine, it now spans a variety of services, providing handy stuff like auctions, shops, games, free email, clubs, personal website space, etc   the list goes on and on. This expansion is mainly due to the fact that Yahoo! has acquired many companies since its incorporation, companies such as GeoCities (in May 1999), which became part of Yahoo! and provided space on the web for the personal websites of the members of Yahoo!, until it closed in 2010. In total, Yahoo! has acquired 20 companies since its inception. This has made Yahoo!'s domination of the World Wide Web not unlike the domination of Microsoft in the PC platform market. Yahoo! has also 'broadened its horizons' since its incorporation   the website is now available in 12 different languages, and the company has offices around the world.

For the first 7 years of my child life, I was his only parent. His father was never in the picture at all. This made dating a challenge. I didn even bother trying until he was several years old. A lot of guys never saw a first date because they made it clear that they wanted to be my top priority. Then I met the guy I now married to. My mom babysat for me when we went on dates in the beginning, but he was always aware that I would drop everything if my son needed me. And he supported that. Once I allowed him to meet my son (wanted to know him somewhat, first), he was so excited to include my son as much as possible. He plan kid friendly dates, so my son could participate. If I couldn go out, he came to us. Any time that something happened and I had to choose between the two, he insisted that my son be priority. He never complained. This is why I married him. I knew he always put my son and any future kids first. My son calls him Daddy now and is always asking to play with him. He drop everything to take a break and play, no matter how important.

You sound very well minded. I no therapist, but I say you on the right track for sure. I was pretty heavy on opiates from 15 16 and I must say that that played a huge part in my self confidence deflating like it did. I played WoW; logged on to raid and grind, crushed whatever and nodded to sleep. This was a destructive cycle, but I was fortunate not to encounter depersonalization until later on (possibly because this stint only lasted three or four months.) Getting out more and involved in niche communities helped. For instance, I started playing a lot of board games which, in turn, led to me painting miniature figures for use in board games and games like Warhammer.

DNA published a story yesterday that said the prime minister, in his last two years, wants to seize control of the economy from Pranab Mukherjee and secure his own legacy (he perhaps given up on a major breakthrough with Pakistan).

Two cards should not be drawn to a pair unless an ace or king can be retained with them, except for the purpose of a "bluff." If most of the other players are "in," the chances of drawing an ace or a king are not quite so good as those of drawing a small card, because the other players are more likely to be staying in on high than on low cards. The probabilities of such being the case are of course quite impossible to determine, but they are very slight and are more than' compensated by the chances of increasing the comparative value of the hand by making aces or kings "up" instead of two small pairs'.

For example, he referred to the way that I speak (high voice) as "annoying." Another time he said that he was "annoyed" to learn that I had taken him to a vegetarian restaurant.

The catch for Zynga is that the Facebook gravy train may not last forever, and the company will eventually need more distribution partners. and Facebook will continue to exist in a relationship of cooperative competition, according to Werbach. can afford to put all its eggs in Facebook basket, but neither can it live without the enormous push that it gets from its Facebook relationship. which recently launched a new social network called Google+ to compete with Facebook, would seem to be a natural diversification option for Zynga. However, Zynga would still be dependent on what Clemons calls parallel monopolies. that in five years, the world is 50% Google and 50% Facebook, Clemons says. will still need both. Half of its revenues go away if it gets into a fight with either. Distribution does not diversify as easily as other resources. 2010, Zynga cut a distribution deal with Yahoo to feature games, including poker, FishVille and Mafia Wars, on the search engine games channel. The company has not disclosed revenue generated from the Yahoo partnership. In its broadest global diversification move to date, Zynga on July 26 announced that it has partnered with Tencent, one of China top Internet service providers. The move could give Zynga a much broader reach and keep the company Facebook deal intact because the social network does not operate in China.
