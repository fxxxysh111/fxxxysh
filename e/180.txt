This is how it works: Imagine that each party is sitting at a table, and they each have a stack of poker chips, one for each person who voted for them. Party A, with the largest stack, has the most votes, so gets the first seat in the assembly. This party then splits their stack into two equal piles and we look at who has the highest stack again. It could be that Party A now has the two largest stacks, and so it gets another seat in the assembly, and it splits its chips into three equal piles, or Party B now has the highest stack in which case it gets the next seat and its pile is split into two. This continues until all the seats are filled.

As expected, Carroll and her associates found the highest number of bacteria in plastic bowls, but the most harmful pathogens, including E. coli and MRSA, exploded in ceramic bowls. The researchers were shocked. "Ceramic was a surprise in that we found the most harmful microorganisms present," Carroll says. "At the moment, we can't say for sure why this is, but it could be that ceramic enables bacteria to form structures called biofilms, which allow large numbers of bacteria to adhere and colonize surfaces as a group and protects them from certain elements that would normally kill/remove bacteria."

Cost of Care for Common Back Pain Conditions initiated with DC versus MD/DO as First Physician: Experience of one of Tennessee based General Health Insurer.There treatment was initiated by either a DC or MD demonstrates that treatment for an episode of Low Back Pain with a chiropractor results in lower costs for Low Back Pain care than episodes initiated by an medical doctor even after controlling for severity of the patients presenting complaints.This is a very large population of patients insured by one of the major insurers in the USA.The discussion section explains that by restricting access to chiropractic care, insurers may be paying more for management of Low Back Pain episodes than if they allowed unrestricted access to chiropractic care.This is a very significant finding which may cause health insurance companies to reappraise their policies concerning restricted access to chiropractic care.A retrospective claims analysis study (October 2004 thru Sept 2006) on Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee's intermediate large group fully insured population to determine if there are differences in the cost of Low Back Pain care, including visits medications (narcotic, analgesic, nonsteroidal, and muscle relaxants), when a Patient can choose Treatment with a MD or a DC.Coverage included unrestricted access to primary specialtyproviders of their choice unlimited services, exceptfor a 20 visit/yr year limit on physical therapy.There wereno differences in this population for co pays or deductiblesbased on provider type.Patients had open access to MDs DCs thru self referral without any limit to the number of visits or differences in co paysto these 2 provider types.Paid costs for episodes of Low Back Pain care initiated with a chiropractor were almost 40% less than episodes initiated with an MD.Even after risk adjusting each Patients costs (determining the severity of clinical presenting symptoms), episodes of care initiated with a DC were 20% lower than those initiated with an MD.Conclusions: Paidcosts for episodes of care initiated with a DC were almost40% less than episodes initiated with an MD.

For the past 4 years while I was in Cali. I fell into a deep slump that I couldn't seem to pull out of and it was well, crappy. I had my third child and put on alot of extra weight. I was in an accident that injured my back so it was my excuse to be on my butt for 6 months. I gained more weight and was heavier than I ever was in my life. It made it harder to move around and I couldn't stick with any diet long enough to have any affect and I lacked motivation. I know that happens to people but I continued to make excuses for four years. I went out less and less and was rarely physically active. I played fast food poker with Glen every other night (I'll see your double cheeseburger and raise you a large fries and a chocolate shake. Whaddya mean you're out? I'm just gettin started. Now anty up dammit!!!) I thought of so many things that I wanted to do. Excercise, take up hobbies, start writing again, hell even clean the kitchen. Everything was always "yea I wanna do it, but I'll start tomorrow." I barely got out of the house for fear I'd miss the latest paternity tests on Maury Povich or Jenny Jones. I drooled with anticipation to see Jerry Springer. Emily's first words were "Jerry! Jerry!" It was my New Years resolution to read 4 books in a year. A year. And I didn't do it.

You could be a really really terrible chef in a shitty restaurant who is good at borrowing money in fact you could be a lot worse of a cook than some random Mom/Dad. Some professional players (particularly new ones) are addicted to gambling in the worst possible way and will eventually go bust.

They don't sound dumb to me. They sound cunning. If you accept a year's payment, then you basically can't get rid of them for a year. I don't know what they are planning. Maybe they are going to be great tenants, or maybe they will have loud parties, not mow the grass, make their neighbors hate them, park 6 cars in the street and leave your house a wreck.

The first step to collecting poker chips that are used in Las Vegas casinos is to understand that there are generally two individual types that are incorporated in these establishments. One type is the standard poker chip that normally displays a wide array of colors and uses a standard denomination system to identify them. Then, there are chips that are typically called "tokens" that are used in gaming machines, such as the slot machines.
The churchgoers I know are leaving the Republican party in droves, but quietly, so that the ministers won shame them. ("faith based" organizations got special treatment under George W.

When you come across a poker chip that is heavy, you can bet that this is a highly durable chip! Many who play poker, play in casinos, or are considered to be professionals in the gaming industry agree that when a chip has more weight to it, it is more durable than the lighter chips. This means that the sound produced by the chip will be more prominent, and the chip itself will typically last longer. If you are looking for a high quality set, try for those that are considered to be 9 grams or higher..

Staying on the west side will also give you access to the free Getty Museum, Getty Villa, and Malibu beaches within driving distance as well.

When purchasing casino poker chips, you will find that most varieties are composed of clay. Clay is considered to be a high grade material when it comes to quality, appeal, and ease of use in the poker industry. Many professionals and leisure players alike agree that these are among the "fanciest" that one can choose from. While composed of clay, there are usually mixtures of other materials as well, but only a small percentage. Casinos typically only use poker chips that are 39mm as far as diameter. Most clay options are this size. You can purchase them in grams from eight to approximately eleven and a half.

An "ace" is a fighter pilot who shoots down 5 enemy aircraft during aerial combat. Each country had a slightly different set of rules for claiming an enemy aircraft "kill". For example, the rule may require that another pilot or person on the ground witness the event. commands also credited aircraft destroyed on the ground as equal to aerial victories. Soviets distinguished between solo and group kills, as did the Japanese. The Allies (US) began to mount gun cameras on the aircraft that could help confirm an enemy aircraft shot down. Of course, if the enemy a/c dove out of the camera range before exploding then it was still in doubt. During World War 1, the "Blue Max" was awarded to German pilots upon downing 8 enemy aircraft. That number was later raised, so that a pilot became an "ace" first and then later received the Blue Max. Also in World War 1, some pilots would fly solo sorties. So, to ensure they would get credit for an enemy aircraft, sometimes they landed and cut the tail number off of the downed aircraft in order to validate their claim. Appendix German "aces" were called "experts" or Experten. Only single air victories were attributed (and only if somebody else could affirm it). This is a "by the way." remark. E. Hartmann (352 victories), G. Barkhorn (301), G. Rall (275), etc, etc, etc, . about 100 pilots scoring more than 100 victories at least. (Full Answer)
13th. (Courtesy Netflix)">DuVernay's latest documentary feature is The 13th, a sobering look at the prison industrial complex that will open the New York Film Festival on September 30   the first time the NYFF has ever selected a work of nonfiction as its opening film. (Netflix and limited theatrical releases will follow on October 7.) If its title sounds like that of a horror film, that's appropriate: The 13th sheds light on a real terror, visited upon real human beings. Constitution, which officially abolished slavery. Yet it also retained an unfortunate loophole, doing away with involuntary servitude "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." The clause has made it possible to arrest American citizens (primarily black American citizens) on flimsy charges, fine them at rates they can't pay, jail them, abuse them, and steal their labor. DuVernay's film tracks these practices from their origins to the present day. Zipping from clip to clip like a racism supercut, The 13th jumps between archival footage of George Wallace pledging allegiance to segregation and choice modern day pundit quotes, then splices in TV and viral video of, say, the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting or protests following the killing of Trayvon Martin. Each three  or four second clip adds support to the argument like a brushstroke on a painting, mixing past and present to prove that history did not come from nowhere, nor is the present moment separate from history. Brought together in one place, the footage makes hauntingly visible the ways in which the justice system has criminalized African Americans, destroying families, promoting negative stereotypes, and ruining individual lives, at least since the ratification of that suspicious amendment in 1865.

Let me make up another example: I play an esper control deck so in game 1 I have literally no minions. In low ranks game 2 my opponent will take all their removal spells out because they know I have no minions in my deck but this is when I side in four copies of thief of sanity. They took almost all their removal out so the odds of them drawing into an answer t3 is very slim. These are the sorts of mindgames that wins you games and lets you climb in low ranks. Once you get to the higher ranks your opponents begin to realize you siding in minions in g2 and begin to answer your threats so you need to come up with a new post sideboard strategy and the cycle begins new. This is just one example but I think it highlights why BO3 is the true way to play the game.

RdC ended over 80 chapters ago, it's old news. There's no financial reason to adapt old material that probably won't even be enough to fill an 11 episode season.

It's a bit disappointing to see the Obama administration engaging in this sort of market worship   hailing markets as a Good Thing in themselves, rather than as an often but not always useful means to an end. But I have reason to think that unlike the Bushies, they don't really believe it; it's just politics. But too many commentators on the left and the right have accepted the ridiculous idea that the Obama administration is actually socialist.

Something that loses a significant amount of meaning if you don watch him change into the kind of person who would help someone else.

In the first phase of the war, much of the press in South America was in fact not pro Union, as the papers were heavily dependent on British/French dispatches, which were often quite sympathetic to the Confederacy.

Yoga Yoga is a form of exercise that helps keep the body in shape. Not only does it help relieve arthritis pain, but it also reduces stress and helps strengthen joints. The mind is intended to focus inward on the body while performing yoga poses such as the camel pose or the lotus pose.

Its gaming take was the second highest in Atlantic City, behind only Bally's Park Place, which is larger. Boughner is already pondering a $200 million expansion of his 125,000 square foot casino, which employs 4,800 people.
Will it ever resolve? Doubtful. I didn know how badly it was going to hurt until we were actually fully intimate   and married, so there was no ending the relationship before it progressed, although I loved him so much even then, and it felt so destined that I can imagine I would have either way.

That an interesting point to ponder. What would Scott and Bobby have bonded over that the others wouldn have? A shared love of hunting, I guess for one thing. I also read that they may have shared the same fetishes, but, how would that conversation ever even begin? Is it normal for guys to discuss their sexual fantasies with each other? Not it my experience, it isn Unless Scott caught Bobby in the act of searching for sexually deviant images. Or, I guess one of them could have brought it to the other attention. "Look at this shit I finding online!!" and a mutual admiration of dead and rotting women began then .
With the defeat of the Japanese 15th Army in Operation Extended Capital, they never stopped retreating (although they fought rearguard actions until the end).

It's quite easy to do this fellow duelist! This is a list of how to do so: Ra) To defeat ra you need enough cards to decrease the attack of your opponents' monsters. This is not for ra itself but to decrease the attack of their monsters before they are used for tributes. Slifer) Another recommendation is to make your opponent discard their hand all the time. 
A: What a bozo! First he asks, then calls you immoral when you tell him. Let him know that your history is yours, not his, and that you own it. It has helped make you what you are today, which he obviously finds attractive. If he wants to know, he has to accept whatever you tell him. If he can't, you may want to ask yourself if you wouldn't be better off with a man who accepts your past but looks toward the future.

Step 7 Take the coins. Once all hands are laid on the table, flip over each hand one at a time. The winner of each hand will get the coin that the hand is placed in front of. If the hands are the same, each player will get a coin for that particular hand. The winner is the first to get four coins, or the first to win three hands in a row. . (Full Answer)
It mainly depends on your sensitivity to the tones. 
The four aces makes the winning hand a four of a kind, so the player's hole cards would determine the winner since all the players have a four of a kind. In this particular case the king would be the highest card held, so it takes the hand. The two, five, and extra nine are not factored into the hand.

Adkins said his cocktails are mixed to be "spirit forward," though I tasted mostly ginger in the highly drinkable "Pursue Happiness," ($12), made with vodka, Aperol, grapefruit, and lime, and was overwhelmed by the herbal Fernet Branca in the aptly named rye whiskey cocktail "Bitter in the 6" ($13).

I feel like they are a lot less troublesome than they were at first. I didn like them initially. I still swear at them sometimes. But it all I ever use anymore when I pick up groceries on the way home from work. Waaay shorter lines and I not frantically trying to bag my stuff properly while keeping up with the clerk running everything through in whatever random order they feel like. The worst is where the store only gives bags up front instead of getting a count afterwards   you can use one bag at a time from the nice dispenser, no you have to tell them how many bags you going to need ahead of time, as if you know how it really going to go, and they peel off a bunch all stuck together and dump them in a lump in front of you and start bionic scanning your shit into a pile before you can even get the first bag unfucked enough to start bagging. And no rack to hold the handles up while you do it. Fuck that. But in the very same store, the self checkout lane has none of that bullshit. I bag on the rack as I go, loading items in a way that gives good support, and tell the machine how many bags I used as I about to pay. Way better experience.

When we hired two new people who were on her level, she had a long talk with me about how I needed to start concentrating on doing work for them. Her reasoning was that it was important to impress them, it was important to get exposed to different facets of our job, and as the junior person I needed to be available to help everyone, and I should focus more on them. So naturally they piled on assignments and I was splitting my time three ways.

Having read Just Kids (Smith's telling of their story), it's impossible not to draw comparisons between the two. Smith's book is an autobiographical work; the film is a color by numbers tall tale.

Stick to it. It is normal to get beat up in your first sparring session.

The idea being that the plague Argonians were blamed for (the Knahaten Flu) was so long ago, that common people of the Fourth Era aren likely to be aware of that past event.

There are somethings you can do on your part. First of all, have some good hygiene. The most important thing is probably confidence. When you are in your room, undress completely. This is a small tip off whether or not you looking for just a legit massage or something more. They will often ask you if this is your first time there. Always say NO. This is another way they try to screen people. If they ask you who you got last time, just say you don recall. Unless they are the only person working there (unlikely), you should be solid. Be friendly and say Hi and ask for their name. Make a little small talk with them. A lot of whether or not they will offer extras with how comfortable they feel with you. You almost always start on your back and it the "flip" where they will offer you extras for some additional "tip". I usually know if they are down for at least a HJ if they spend a lot of time massaging buttocks and inner thighs, usually glazing against the boys "accidentally".

Is a human right.And ultimately, modern love has lost sight of that which is human in all of us. caught up in fitting the state enforced requirement of "reproductive long term couple," we have lost our ability to ask whether it okay to rent someone else womb or even reproduce in our last decades of life or how to treat a dying person in a hospital.That because modern love is not so much about love as about being "good citizens." it time that we modern citizens demand an end to state and economic interference in our love lives  whether in the form of privileges like the Kings, businesses like surrogacy, or punishments like hospitals denying non coupled and non heterosexuals their rights.
