He lives with his family in a village. Literally. His family welcomed us warmly and didn't seem to think that Adem bringing home two unscarved chicks with a car was abnormal. There was no furtniture in the house, only Turkish carpets. And don't forget the Turkish toilet   that would be the hole in the ground.

I use that word loosely since our "communication" consisted of Wendi and I looking up a word in the dictionary, repeating it, and having them nod vigorously. We were very comfortable there nonetheless, and on our way out in the morning, Adem's mom (who was sitting on the dirt floor in the kitchen baking bread) sent us on our way with some fresh breakfast. We dropped Adem back at work and went on our way.

When I entered the garage I noticed that in one of the dogs bowls there was a small turd, clearly dog poo, in one of the bowls. Over the course of the visit, I learnt that one of the dogs pooed in the house over night and my cousin is now forcing the dog to star at this turd in it food bowl all day as punishment. He has an almost three old son and a one year daughter, another baby is on the way. So it got me thinking that if this is how he treats and punishes a smaller creature of lesser intelligence who breaks a house rule, what is he going to do when his kids act like kids and inevitably step out of his line ?

Worse, OP has a chemo port. She doesn even have to hit a vein.

So I think that nurse has the perfect storm of incompetence and negligence to kill a patient if someone doesn intervene.

Upvotes all around! My 2 cats are rescues as well as the surviving kitten from mom cat's previous litter and that cat has a different forever home. After a few failed attempts, we were finally able to catch their mom and get her spayed and ear clipped so she'll be recognized as having been spayed, as well as gotten her all her shots and a clean bill of health. Mom cat was not truly feral, but had been stray for a long time. According to the people who lived in the area for a while, mom cat had litter after litter and at the time we moved, she had taken a liking to a young couple who was making every effort to gain her trust to hopefully adopt her. Even managed to coax her inside a few times. She was a sweet girl, just scared and unsure but kindness goes a long way. Having been spayed and vaccinated removed a big barrier for them to adopt her and definitely improved her outlook. I hope it worked out well for her. But at least she won't ever again have to cope with having to care for kittens and we did the best for her that we could.
