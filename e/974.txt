Coors Light has lost 0.4 market share points in the year to date period, while Bud Light has lost a full point.

Format: First, Moon measures your "functional leg length." (Basically, she checks to see if one leg is longer than the other and how that changes when your legs bend.) This indicates which muscles, fibers and ligaments are out of whack.

The Thermoscan claims to be 100 percent accurate for identifying these points..

Now if you have teen driver or if you live in a bad neighborhood or you really can afford the deductible if something was to happen I would recommend going with 500/500. You have to take into account all of these factors.

Often, after becoming closer with her and talking to her a lot, she realize that a relationship where she is uncomfortable expressing herself isn healthy. I guess usually the guy isn used to hearing her be so direct and he gets defensive immediately and it kind of shuts down the conversation. If the relationship has digressed to the point where the girl is constantly venting to anyone who will listen, it probably time to break up either way.

A few times, I observed his vocal reaction to a neighbourhood cat trying to get into the house through an open window. I'm still not sure if it was a greeting, or some kind of territorial call, but the shrieks and strangled cries he made were definitely unlike anything I'd heard from him in other situations, and sounded amazingly haunting and unearthly. If other cats make noises like that, I can understand why people in the past associated felines with occult practices..

Ad of the day: It's delightful to see a hospitality ad that's so daringly weird. A new sci fi ish spot for UK travel company Thomas Cook shows a guy waking up somewhere new every day   in a farmyard, a hammock in the jungle, a prison bed.

On Thursday last week, after Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had put the finishing touches on an ode to Hillary Clinton and the US Pakistan relationship that would put the PML Q stable of courtesans to shame, Qureshi was asked to rush home. Apparently, the talking points memo Ambassador Husain Haqqani gave him were a tad too servile, even for this government. In any case, the president, prime minister and military elite, having taken Qureshi to task for his performance in Washington DC last week, have sent him back to DC. Essentially so that he can go back to Madam Secretary and press "undo," taking back all the nice things he said about the Kerry Lugar Bill, and about Madam Clinton's pantsuit. As bad as all this makes Qureshi, or Haqqani, look, it makes Pakistan look worse. What country will trust Pakistan when it can't even stick to its effusive praise for foreign leaders for barely 72 hours? And that too for a "partner" that Pakistan itself has chosen to define as its most vital economic and political friend?

An odd or an even number must turn up, and that is why the probability of rolling an odd or an even number with one roll of the dice is one. Lastly, we've seen that the probability of rolling a given number with one roll of the dice is the number of times that number might appear divided by the total number of possibilities that might appear.

On maybe our 8th or 9th visit Jim found a basement window into the psych hospital. The hospital was always hard to get into. The doors were always locked and the windows boarded up. We were all cool exploring the houses and the school, but the abandoned psych hospital in Shadytown was a little heavy for us. Not for Jim though. He went right for the window, and when some of us told him not to go in there, he just looked confused and said "why?" and went on in. We were all true, so we went in after him even though we really didn want to. Our flashlights and headlamps showed us to be in really a typical basement, with pipes running along the ceiling and concrete floors. It was a big room but nothing was in it, but there was a door. Of course Jim walked right over to and went through. The other 4 or 5 of us (it was a while ago, I don remember) froze up, but Jim hollered, "come on" so we went.

Obama supported the no fly zone in Libya which led to the ouster and murder of Gaddafi, and the absolute disaster that country is in now. Libya isn even close to recovering from that.

If you bet 7.00, however, and the villain calls, there is 29.00 in the pot, and the rake is 13.79%. In both cases, let say the Turn card comes out, you bet, and your opponent folds. Over the long run, that roughly 2 1/2% difference in rake between dragging a 29.00 pot, and dragging a 31.00 pot adds up, and most players never even consider it..

As cultural sociologist Jeffrey Alexander points out, if we do not publicly decide what is evil, then we can never know what is good.

Turns out the best fuels and oils, that instill the best longevity, are reserved for the children and neighbors of the best performing pistons, and not the hardest working pistons (as some pseudoengineers would have you believe.) Some pistons, through the complex engineerings of austerity, saving, luck, and privilege occasionally get necessary replacement parts. Many pistons fail before ever even getting a chance to get up to speed. And after their failure, are somehow blamed despite their constant cries for more fuel, more oil while yet living, and spinning, trying to generate more power.

It scale is on a totally different level, to the point where even after 20+ separate novels in the same universe it feels like you are only scraping the surface. But, it is a bit much. I have a hard time recommending it to people because it is such a commitment for the reader. I have to be sure the person would like historical military fiction, as well as sword and spell fantasy, as well as complicated multi character narratives. I know plenty of people who read a lot of fantasy, but I don actually know anyone in real life who has read Malazan.

Do not stick to one strategy for every game because this will obviously make your opponents read you more easily.

It didn seem like Christmas at all. Jess and I spent the day wandering the maze of streets in Jaisalmer and tried to coordinate picking up Wendi and Ashley. Our email from them was that the train was full so they would be arriving on a bus or a train at some point in the afternoon. While Ashley was showering she noticed a man reaching through the bathroom window with a mirror!!! They had two meals in Delhi and saw mice in the restaurants. They took a train to Jodhpur and then illegally hopped on a 3rd class connecting train to Jaisalmer. After 18 hours of flight time, one night in a hotel (with a peeping tom), and 18 hours on trains, we had one night in our hotel in Jaisalmer and then left at 7 am the following day on a camel safari!

NTA at all. Your girlfriend is. It's your business what you choose to share/post on social media. She doesn't get to dictate that. Furthermore, you're concerned because this doesn't affect your personal life. It affects your professional life   current and prospective. You can't   and shouldn't   burn bridges for our future to satisfy the whims of a girlfriend who is clearly manipulative, immature, and waaaaay too dramatic. She also took something that had fuck all to do with her and managed to make it about her. That's plumb crazy, dude. Not worth it.
Of course, there are women who have falsely accused others of assault. One of my close friends was, in fact, a victim of this in high school. It completely upended his life, and was a terrible, traumatizing experience. 
It was fun. 
But if so, what created the idea of an apple? Which came first, the creator or the created? I think the key is in the fact that this creator must exist outside of time or space. 
Maximizing the visual space is also key. Glass shower enclosures, floating vanities, wall hung toilets, flush or curbless shower transitions and using the same tile throughout are some strategies designers use to make bathrooms appear spacious, light and airy.

He's a pioneer not just in personal finance and understanding all that kind of stuff but also the entrepreneurial side of that. He built a personal finance site called Bargaineering, which he then called it liquidated, sold at a big profit. So he was a very successful entrepreneur and has made a large number of great decisions across his career and had a couple of big wins as well.

Hey. Saw this topic and wanted to let you know this: age doesn mean anything! I sure everyone hears those rare cases of 16 year old singers, drummers, producers or even DJs, but thats it, those are rare. Only happen by mere chance. I say its rare when you take in to account the aprox. total number of people trying to break into the industry and those that really succeed through hard work. Like I said, these are examples for NO ONE simply because in these cases these very young artists never worked really hard to get there, never developed an ear for music, especially if you considering music production, which requires long years of practice. Oh, and I talking about this very moment, where the industry is most competitive because everyone can be a producer or artist (which is good, because you can access many tools easily nowadays, and at same time bad because there is lots of junk out there too).

Expected value is meant to help you quantify and better understand the nature of your potential risks and rewards when making a decision. In theory, always opting for decisions with a positive EV will eventually work out in your favor; however, EV shouldn't be used as a sole factor in your decision making.

BTN also is unlikely to have a hand that can call your jam, even if he is short too. He's on the BTN and contemplated raising, so theres no way he's trapping, which makes his hand look like 10s/JJs/AK.

Of course not all cats are the same so mileage may vary. I heard of younger cats being too resistant for leash training or too unfocused to learn tricks.

Because it's not realistic to hit either a Royal or a Straight Flush during the course of 1000 hands of play, your return will likely be more in the area of 99.54% minus 2.53% or 97%.

Obviously our economy should contain a mixture of free market forces and government intervention, and this is the position relative to the 2 extremes, but is there any real pride in taking this position?

Those who do work full time will spend at least some of their work hours engaged in business management and marketing activities; they may perform practical tasks such as cleaning linens and other equipment; or, they may engage in other professional activities such as teaching or writing.

If there isn as much content, then the boost isn as useful since there little point in accruing extra gold.

I love watching a movie on the big screen. I was legitimately sad that I couldn't watch Roma and will not be able to watch The Irishman (in my country at least) in theatres. But saying that this should keep them from receiving the awards that some movies legitimately deserve is just such an elitist and condescending thing to do. And that even in regards to own peers like Scorcese and Cuaron. Really sends a bad message to aspiring filmmakers, not that anyone takes this particular opinion of him seriously.

We may never have evidence that Michael Jackson sexually abused Wade Robson and James Safechuck at Neverland Ranch when they were boys, as the two convincingly allege in HBO four hour documentary Leaving Neverland.

For those who join a poker room and come to the point to where they want to play for real money, there are additional opportunities to play without cash. And these can be profitable. They are "Freeroll Tournaments" and "Player Point Programs". Freeroll tournaments are free entires into poker tournaments that cost nothing to get into. These pay cash or other awards to the player depending on how well they did during the tournament. You can either enter a freeroll when they are made available or you could receive an invitation from the online poker room itself. Player point programs are points awarded from the poker room to you based on your time at the tables. Depending on the program, these points can be redeemed for cash, merchandise or entry fees into satellite tournaments. You could potentially enter a satellite tournament with prize seats to the World Poker Tour or World Series of Poker events and win huge amounts of cash. In 2004 Greg Raymer entered a satellite tournament through an online poker room, won a WSOP seat and eventually went on the win the World Series of Poker title and $5,000,000 in cash.

And bonds are currently rather unattractive due to the low interest. International bonds may pay higher interests, but many may still remember what happened to Argentinia government bonds. Also, should interests rise, the trade value of existing low interest bonds drops, so if you need to liquidize your bonds ahead of their maturity, you risk losing profit or even part of what you invested.

In terms of timing, around 4.8 KM(3 miles) per hour is typically a safe estimate for the moving average of a group of reasonably experienced paddlers. So, (generally and without knowing the area) if I were planning a trip, I would plan on around 8.3 hours of paddling to do 40 KM and 6.25 hours for 30 KM. This assumes constant paddling and a semi efficient stroke, so given your groups experience that may not be a reasonable estimate and it may take much longer..

People who want Overwatch to be grimdark, edgy or more mature just smack me of the insecurity people who enjoy cartoons in adulthood possess. Not all of them, of course, but I heard the views of plenty of Bronies or fans of Steven Universe that they want the shows in question to tackle more mature subjects or focus on the lore of the world more, when both are unnecessary aside from their function to reaffirm to these people that they not immature or childish for enjoying cartoons.
Then again, both my wife and I think spending hundreds of dollars on Gucci purses and pretty much everything else is horrific waste of money and would rather spend $20 on that stuff on trips or cruises or other life experiences; Veblen and conspicuous consumption and such.

Ride seems to have taken a little too much after Orga, and appears to be leading a Neo Tekkadan sort of group with the Human Debris kids. But it fitting that he should be the one to end Nobliss, and the manner in which it goes down is appropriate for that fat sack of shit.

An unflappable temperament is obviously what a good poker player and a great ODI finisher have in common. But there is strategy involved, too, and Dhoni grasp over a one day game is clearly on much firmer ground than his Test batting and captaincy. To understand what Dhoni is doing right as a finisher we have to look at the dynamics of the limited overs format.

I was 8 and didn't know what sex was so I brushed it off.

NOW THINK, what it's really going to be like for Musikfest concerts? A disaster! We have seen the future and it a betrayal! The Sand Island site was a MUCH better location! I cannot for the life of me, believe that the Musikfest officials chose such a poor site to get to, or look at, it's ugly down there! Speaking of Musikfest location for concerts, wait to you see it, its a scam on the concert go er of unbelievable proportions! You have the noise of third street and the trains to contend with, and being out in the open surrounded by old ugly brick buildings that will reflect sound waves in every echoing direction.

I was definitely shaken up for a while. I had my landlord change all the locks and set up motion sensor lights on my balcony.

In September 2009, Toyota announced a new "self repairing" clear coat finish that's poised to roll out on their new Lexus models. What makes it possible is a secret proprietary ingredient. Whatever this magic ingredient is, Toyota claims that it promotes a closer molecular bond within the paint. This makes it very dense, while improving its flexibility and elasticity. These characteristics make the coat less prone to damage from the sun's UV rays and acid from things like rain and bird droppings. The flexibility also allows minor surface blemishes to be self restored. The new breakthrough requires no extra care to help protect the paint job from losing its luster and gloss.
