When it comes to home tournament play, it is a matter of choice, when it comes to Poker Felt materials, water proofed or not and the size and arrangement of the table. You should plan to have enough seating for everybody, or you may find yourself in need of an additional table. There are some portable poker tables for a little over $160, if you find yourself in this situation, and they have foldable legs and can be put away until you need them.. 
At the chain, I am more short on time so do a short Q to understand what the client needs and give the massage, and the front desk does the rest.

For someone who seems so pro GTO such as Berkey, I find it hard for him to have a single hand in his range better than what he holding. If you folding close to 100% of your range in this spot (I guess you can have some AJ/A9 combos), you become very exploitable.

So Ace, Queen, Queen was on the table and the Asian girl had Ace Queen in hand meaning that she had a full house (3 of one thing, 2 of another) by having 3 queens and 2 aces. The other guy had 2 aces in his hand, which meant that he had a full house of 3 aces and 2 queens (as the 2 queens were already on the table), so he had a better full house than she did. A full house is one of the best hands in Poker..

Mobile phones have made a tremendous impact on the world, for sure. Once I saw a widow in Albania standing in her field with her cow, far from any building, talking on a mobile phone. I wondered who she was talking to. Maybe she was calling the market to find out if it was a good time to sell a cow or some milk. Now with touch phones, people in very isolated places can do banking or get news with apps. When I was a small child my parents had a phone, but it was a large box on the wall and had a crank that they turned when they wanted to make a call.

So they fire away on the turn. Calling a pair of 8s here isn that fun. Especially considering they always assume I have a weak hand (correctly so).

The whole polarisation in politics running right now is another example. Add in conservative versus progressive/change thinking and it multiplied.

Pace yourself and your bankroll. First, make a budget and stick to it. If you have $5,000 to take to Vegas to play at the WSOP for two weeks don't blow through it and take out another $5,000 at the ATMs. Pace yourself and keep the game fun. If you hop off the plane, throw your bags on the hotel bed and head to the nearest $2 $5 NLHE table enjoy yourself, but if you lose $500 right off the bat go take a break. Don't lose a big chunk of your bankroll the first couple of days after you arrive or you may end up going broke during the middle of your trip if your luck doesn't turn. It might seem trite, but I've heard of, and tried in the past, an envelope system during short trips to Vegas. Take two envelopes for each day of the week of your stay. Mark two envelopes for each day (two with "Monday," two with "Tuesday," etc.), place money in one and seal it and leave the other one unsealed. Only open the envelope that represents the correct day of the week and place any money left over at the end of the day in the other envelope for that corresponding day.

So actually I think flop raise size was good for anticipating one caller, but when you get two, well you now have a very awkward stack going into turn ($1200 with $700 in the middle). Getting two callers I think warrants giving up / trying to hit a set of 3s or two pair. Or get to cheap showdown if the flush hits.. 
That might sound kind of nice to you, or it might sound hellish, but the reality is, about 20 percent of women go through this for some part of their pregnancy. Bed rest, which can range from supervised time in a hospital bed to limiting normal daily activities and a lot of sitting around, is prescribed for all kinds of pregnancy complications, from gestational diabetes to poor fetal development to an "incompetent cervix." It's a pretty old idea, but it became a mainstay of western obstetrics in the 19th century, when any sign of complications would land a lady alone in bed, in the dark, sometimes even with earplugs   basically a sensory deprivation chamber.

I once knew a person who felt like they needed to cheat because they felt like that is the only way they can win. Other people just cheat because can, or because they are really good at it.

Poker is a game of incomplete information. It only works because no one knows what anyone else has, and all of poker's skills are directed toward either divining what others have based upon their actions, and hiding what you are doing based upon your own. Erego, don't give information for free. 
Eating disorders (and this body dismorphia) have been around for centuries. Elisabeth of Austria (commonly referred to as "princess sissi", and hailed for her beauty) was assasinated in 1896, and she was recorded to be entirely obsessed and somewhat neurotic about her appearance, including a very restrictive diet and exercise regime.

Yang comes on the show one time and everyone's immediately jerking his socialist dick off into the sunset without a backward glance as to how other factors might play into whether a basic living wage is actually a good idea in the long term, or whether it might actually just further contribute to the dumbing down and eventual opening up for enslavement of the American people. Not saying Yang is a a bad guy or that his proposed policies have zero potential merit, it's just interesting to watch this group collectively jump on the bandwagon for a policy as radical as UBI, without considering how close to communism and it's associated evils that it brings them.

This exercise can be taken to any extent. Can non Buddhists use terms like meditation or zen? Is it cultural appropriation, and therefore bad practice, for a non Buddhist to have a budda statue in their home?

Can non Americans display stars and stripes, or use the term "freedom" however they so choose?
Also, the only advantage, if you could call it that, that a non copyleft solution has is that it helps nonfree software.

JTs is a great hand pre flop, sure. But not because of its raw equity, and the shorter the SPR gets the more raw equity matters. You should be 3betting linearly in this spot and JTs is an awful 3bet to 20% of your stack.

Unambiguous sincerity is beyond Reynolds range as an actor, and Fleck and Boden use this to keep us guessing: is Curtis running a long con, or could he be motivated by genuine friendship?Though set in the present, the film has a deliberate retro flavour, with a blues soundtrack and frequent allusions to 20th century popular culture (Gerry imagines himself dressing up in a white suit, like the 1970s country legend Glen Campbell).Softer and sweeter than these forerunners, the film is basically a chaste romance between the two men, with the gentle pace allowing ample time to dwell on their fond amusement at each other; women are marginal, including Sienna Miller in a typically thankless "girlfriend" role.
