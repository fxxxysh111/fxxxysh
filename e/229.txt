At NL2 3betting can be very profitable since most players over fold (fold too much) to 3bets and generally continue with a very strong range. As long as you don spew money with top pair post flop, then 3betting in position with suited connectors and A2s A5s (especially BTN vs CO) can be very profitable. Do it occasionally with these hands (because they have reasonable equity against premium hands) and all the time with your premium hands (JJ+, AQ+, KQ)..

Usually the prize money for the poker tournaments comes from the entry fees. This fees is most often known as the 'buy  in' fees. Sometimes the money flows in from an external source or agency. But this amount gets invested in buying the invitations only. The buy in fetches you a calculated amount of chips to start your game with. These chips act as your 'play money'. Play money can be re purchased only in 're buy' tournaments. The former are those where the organization holding the tournament beforehand decides upon the winner. While in the latter the winner is calculated proportionally. These are split between the players left at the end proportional to the amounts of play money each has accumulated during the game.

Two pair will win, in Texas Holdem' hands ranking two pair is higher than three of a kind. The reverse is for all other types of poker. This is not even close to correct, whoever typed this is not smart or simply does not know poker rules. However, it also depends on whether the dealer qualified or not, and whether the player bet on the Pair Plus. On the Pair Plus it does not matter what the hand is, if it is a pair or better, it gets paid. If you are talking about other players on the table, it does not matter, in Three Card Poker the players play against the dealer and not each other. (Full Answer)

Yeah   immensely fair and why I never been able to bring this up sooner. another part I was struggling with in presenting this argument was the fallacy where by pointing out how you were setting me up to fail by constructing an argument comprised entirely of fallacies, I was dismissing your entire argument   which is itself; a fallacy.

This isn to say people with disability should be prevented from running but a mere consideration for chronic illnesses and a plan to manage them during intense schedules, and an obvious you terminal practical question so that one would not need to be replaced within short order.

It makes sense that Verhoeven's audacious sensibility would appeal to Huppert, whose portrayal of the sadomasochistic Erika Kohut (partial to genital slicing and Mom humping) in Haneke's The Piano Teacher endures as one of her most indelible performances from the past fifteen years. "Verhoeven is always on the razor's edge," the actress explains. "Like in Black Book"   his 2006 feature   "you have the Jewish girl sleeping with the Nazi." Huppert inhales dramatically before continuing: "It's always a bit hard to swallow. There's always the risk that you confuse the [critique] with the empathy. "If I was going to explain with Paul before [starting] Elle, it would have been hell, with an h   to explain [Michle's] behavior," she insists. "And Paul never said a word to me as we were doing the film, never. He said, 'I was completely more like a witness.' " Huppert says that she approached the role as a spectator of sorts as well: "I never knew exactly what I was going to do the day before. It was always a surprise for me as I was doing it."

No time, he was soaring over 60,000 feet. Up here, without a pressurized flight suit or cockpit, blood would boil and intestines burst. Outside the temperature had plunged 160 degrees.

The radio could not be used to let colleagues in Pakistan know: that could alert the Russians. Instead he broadcast two clicks. Peshawar sent back a single click: proceed as planned.

When someone gives a lecture on a college campus, they can more or less say whatever they want to say since they are protected both by the principles of free speech and academic freedom. However, when a college throws its institutional weight behind someone  for instance, by inviting them to commencement or naming an endowned chair after them, the stakes are much higher and the symbolic weight of that person speech much heavier.

We are engaged in a war which has two dimensions to it. It is our war because religious extremism unchecked would have devoured the meaning of Pakistan. With the Taliban triumphant we could have become a Somalia or a Sudan but not anything like the Pakistan our founding fathers were trying to create. But it is also America's war. We didn't ask America to jump into Afghanistan but for reasons of its own it did. And now it is stuck there, the seemingly quick victory of 2001 turning into an extended nightmare. A complete victory in Afghanistan the Americans cannot win. This they are now admitting themselves. The utmost they can hope for is a partial victory, or something that can be sold as victory: a gradual withdrawal, as in Iraq, without too much loss of face. This aim is unachievable without the open ended help of the Pakistan army this side of the Durand Line.

While much of Phuket is overbuilt, the JW Marriott, the island's newest luxury resort, faces ten miles of Mai Khao beach that will never be developed because they're part of the Sirinath Marine National Park, the protected breeding grounds of endangered leatherback turtles.

Here you can walk for miles and see no one.

If Wasteland, Baby! doesn't quite carve out a peaceful aural hiding space, blame Hozier's voice, a loud, rumbling thing, simultaneously raw and mannered. He can't stop roaring. A soul man should sound like he at least knows how to relax, even if he isn't relaxing at a given moment; Hozier flaunts his tortured solemnity on sad songs and love songs alike. There's no reason a song whose hook is "Lover, be good to me" should also include verses like "When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates/When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake."

Also, this might seem strange but Im technically pro choice in the sense that I support legal abortion up to 20 weeks for exactly the reasons you mentioned (a ban on abortion is too impractical counter productive and can have harmful effects on teenagers).

Easier access to contraception, education, and a rethinking of how we regulate sex within our society can help us to prevent unwanted pregnancies and avoid this dilemma entirely..

If someone doesn care about you, they don get input into your self worth.

Fate/EXTRA CCC, is difficult one because which one servant is going to be featured for the rerun version, whether it going to be one of them or three Alter Egos (Kazuradrop, Kingprotea and Violet) from CCC Foxtail, or different character from same series that we recognize, might be ended up as SR servant as well. If you ask me that "If Alter Egos aren to be implemented in CCC rerun, then who they are?", my answer is would be Rani VIII or Hakuno Kishinami.

Scopes: I never use the purple scopes over the Classic or 2x Bruiser. I large portion of the scopes are being avoided by the player base, and I think this should be addressed early in the games life. I suggest removing the Classic HCOG from the loot table and giving each scope in the game an option to go into a Classic HCOG type of scope. I don mind using a 4x 8x or 2x 4x if I could quickly go into a Classic HCOG when needed.

It works so well that I usually don have to send him out for a cool down.

Outs are cards which a hand needs to have appear (on the board in the case of holdem and other flop games) in order to win. You are correct in saying that AK has 6 outs against 22 preflop, but 22 itself does not have outs per se, because it is already ahead. In order to win, it just needs the AK to not hit any of it's outs (or to redraw on a subsequent card to the outs it does have then).. 
The first step to collecting poker chips that are used in Las Vegas casinos is to understand that there are generally two individual types that are incorporated in these establishments. One type is the standard poker chip that normally displays a wide array of colors and uses a standard denomination system to identify them. Then, there are chips that are typically called "tokens" that are used in gaming machines, such as the slot machines.. 
The edge you have is that 3 chips doesn matter to you, whereas it a massive investment for a 15 chip stack. But risking 15 chips usually does start to matter to you.

The rook can still take, but then the new queen takes the rook, the other black rook takes and then the king takes the rook. The end result is that Hikaru just exchanged his two rooks for two pawns and it is an EASY win for white, but white didn think of advancing the pawn as helping out, white just saw that the next move would be for the rook to take the pawn and it would be checkmate.

Sometimes just using a broader surface area like the palm of your hand instead of the very tips of your fingers will make a huge difference.I would avoid anything traction like; don pull on any joints.Otherwise have atter! Get the SO to treat you as well! There no better way to know what feels good on someone else then to have it done on yourself!If there is an actual injury or problem go see a therapist and they will often give you advice on how to self treat between appointments (and you can pick up techniques from them as well)I swear by both the stick and foam rollers. Unless you can get a massage every day, having those tools available helps maintain the effects of the massage between treatments.Commonly my clients will come in once a week, so in the 6 off days I assign stretching, exercise and self massage so that I not starting from square one next treatment.They really work, they can be painful, but they work.I use Swedish techniques, so lots of kneading and muscle manipulation with the fibers.

The college doesn really provide any facilities for engineering students to study or really any facilities useful to engineering students at all besides the ECC. This turns the library into 70% engineering students, which would be okay if the culture in the library was to study and not just to watch netflix in the silent section and talk "quietly" to your friends while others are trying to complete their degree.

And it also funny, legitimately funny, because people who share her experiences and those who don can both laugh at the interesting way she views and conceptualises the world through humour, whether or not we lived through and thought about what she talking about or not.So to say that experience has no affect on whether a joke is good or not is plainly, obviously false. Different people have different subjective experiences and viewpoints which means they will find different things funny.

Apart from a short stay in Paris (1927 30), Magritte spent his whole adult life in Brussels, issuing his mind wrenching visual conundrums from a base of the most perfect bourgeois propriety, using a corner of his living room for a studio and never painting any naked woman but his wife Georgette, who, in return, never posed for any other artist. The common man in Magritte's paintings, with his raincoat and bowler, whether standing with an apple in front of his face or floating down in multitudes upon the unperturbed streets of Brussels, really is Magritte   the poker faced enchanter.

Camille's father, like in the show, is barely mentioned in the book. He's just some guy Adora hooked up with when she was 17 and he left before Camille was born.Her sexual assault is also barely in the books and isn't mentioned again after her "first date" with Richard. In the book she never gets an apology, she doesn't have flash backs to it, etc.I feel like Camille talks about having short hair in the book, but doesn't specify when she cut it? I'm not sure about that one. But IIRC she was assaulted after Marian died, but she had short hair when Marian was alive. So she grew her hair out between Marian dying and being assaulted.Nothing is mentioned about dropping out of cheerleading.(Please someone correct me if I got anything wrong)From what I can remember, Amma is arrested, put into a jail/institution until she 18, but it suggested she be locked up beyond that. Camille visits her once and Amma admits she killed the girls because they were taking Adora attention away from her and she couldn deal with it.Camille moves in with Eileen and Curry and relapses with the cutting. She finally goes hard at the small, empty spot on her back that she never carved words into, but Curry bursts in and stops her just as she about to cut her face. The book ends on an "optimistic" tone as she says that she is trying to learn to let herself be loved and taken care of by them.

The whole marketing consumer complex of our economy has put billions of dollars into trying to make people feel happy all the time.

Obviously the instructions for those extremes should differ from each other.

Get set for lots of fun!. 
It's like you're somewhat ashamed or want to keep it a secret despite telling someone about it. 
In the book, he tells Camille kind of on the sly that he already investigated all the spots she brought him in the woods, and that for me was the first tip off that Dick always knew more than he led on, looking back at the whole story. I'm not sure if we are necessarily supposed to have believed that he was looking into female suspects, I think the point was that he was never completely honest with Camille.

Whatever happens this winter, however, Warne does not believe that his Rajasthan Royals colleague, Shaun Tait, will agree to make a comeback in Test cricket, despite the hype that surrounded his 100mph spell at Lord's on Sunday, and his integral role in Australia's two face saving victories in the final two ODIs.
I was 13 and waiting for a ride with my sister and parents at Dollywood. Across the way, two very pretty girls about my age were smiling at me. I smiled back and acted all cool because i was a skater boy with skater hair and my vision street wear and some shirt with a skull on it or something. It was working too. The girls whispered to each other and giggled and one even waved at me. Then my mom reached her damn hand in my face and popped a pimple right there public. The girls were aghast. I was humiliated. I have never forgiven her.

Instead, we had LA which has 2 teams to represent them in the NFL roster vs New England a team that has been in 9 of 19 Super Bowls since 2000. This isn factoring how pissed the south is that the Saints were screwed.
The current music industry is made in a way so opaque that most people give up because of this and other reasons. Besides, one thing I learned, by listening and reading lots of artist interviews, is that most young and charted (top 50) artists nowadays are there because they knew someone in the industry (I mean, really strong connections!). The way I see it, the independent artists, especially the old ones, are very very superior to the charted artists, not only due to hard work but because they are really professional in what they do. 
No cars. 
I suppressed my habitual aversion to such pranks, and looked around the room to see the Now Teach trainees obediently shouting along with the younger ones. They were getting on with it. And so must I.
But even though noticeably large muscles wouldn be any more realistic, women are weaker to the extent that they are smaller. Just like men are. You mention tennis? Men thrash women at tennis.

Personally, I wouldn't be putting myself out to have a relationship with somebody who pays no interest in me. Equally, I wouldn't expect my husband to have a close relationship with somebody who pays no interest and constantly argues with me. That's not fair.

The Oscars ceremony has always had a somewhat nauseating quality to it, a slight stench of smugness and self congratulation detectable under all that cologne and perfume.

Most of them have free coffee (naked even has free beer!) and free wifi (of course) so when you add it up it about the same cost as being in a cafe with the flexibility of using multiple locations within the same company and as far as i know most of them are 24 hours too.

Das wrde ich als Betroffener einfach nur als Hohn empfinden, wenn mir Menschen, die eindeutig privilegierter sind als ich, sich fr mich dann Begriffe ausdenken, die mich nicht als minderprivilegiert, sondern als andersprivilegiert darstellen."Du kannst deine Beiner nicht benutzen und bist an einen Rollstuhl gefesselt, aber immerhin kriegen deine Arme ein ordentliches Workout!""Du bist nicht arm, du bist andersvermgend, denn was dir auf dem Bankkonto fehlt, gleichst du mit deinem Herzen aus." Geil, da fhlt man sich gleich viel besser.Und wenn der Gedanke ist, Menschen nicht ganz beilufig mit negativen Wrtern zu beschreiben, dann macht es absolut keinen Sinn, sich hier an dem Wort behindert aufzuhngen, was wohl zu den beliebtesten Aufhngern gehrt.Man msste sich an so ziemlich jeder Beleidigung und abflligen Bemerkung aufhngen und niemand drfte mehr irgendetwas Negatives ber irgendwen sagen, wenn es nicht auf eine hundertprozentig konstruktive Art und Weise geschieht.Kestrelqueen  0 points  submitted 1 day agoIch hab versucht den Gedankengang zu erklren und dachte eigentlich, dass es recht klar ist, dass es gerade nicht darum geht Leuten dann alternative Fhigkeiten zuzusprechen.

She has a miscarriage, goes all Mad King and with nothing else to lose, tries to wildfire the whole damn place. She burned the sept, now she tries to burn king's landing. Everyone she loves is gone. Jamie's turned on her. Everyone is closing in. Just fucking torch it all.
It so great when other people step up to help a woman being harassed in public. When I was a teen, I was standing at a bus stop and a man kept getting too close to me, asking me pushy questions and making me uncomfortable. Some middle aged women walking past immediately picked up on what was happening and one of them said, "Hey honey would you like to walk with us to the next stop?" Then glared at the man. I was so grateful to her. He wasn doing anything overtly threatening but he was clearly pushing my boundaries and making me uncomfortable and this lady was like, "none of that shit today, creep." I try to be like that woman now that I older and less of a pushover.
Games need rules. Without them, they aren't games at all, just a bunch of assholes running around with a ball throwing Monopoly money and darts at each other.

Minor update: I advised him of his many options after reading the comments. He went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. Mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage..

Pour l'instant le proltariat se tasse et se rsigne. Les sirnes qui le maintienne de leurs chants nfastes sont puissantes et effectives.

Les uns et les autres n'ont pas conscience que ce qui figure le Proltariat du troisime millnaire n'est plus le gavroche sortant de la mine et travaillant 12 heures par jour, six jours sur sept. Ce qui figure le Proltariat en 2007, aprs le 11 Septembre 2001, c'est la masse globale et globalise des producteurs et consommateurs. Autant dire : tout le monde.

Discomfort is more of a tight, annoying feeling where i just have to always crack it. Sometimes i do feel a pain but its not too often, it makes me want to put pressure on my foot. 
If you feel you are not appropriately draped, you also should speak up. 
So basically after I watched all of this is Jnandez wanted to be part of the nwo wolf pack ( doug, joey, ryan, matt) and Doug (hulk hogan) gave Jnandez(sting) his free t shirt and pat on the back and Jay wasn to happy with that. Thats the rules in the nwo you can speak in broken english. Sounds like the NWO won as the evil Doug (hogan) basically poked Jay(sting) in the eyes and dropped the special leg drop across Jays neck keeping that 100k to rub on his titties. Jay got out his feelings (hope he is finally happy now and can drop this) so hopefully he feels better now( even though hes a millionaire) and can go on back the poker tables and win that 100k back in a few months. ANd for the love of god stop asking people to join your plo site ever 5m when you stream poker. Your stream turned into a plo infomercial every 5m while your playing.

I on the fence about an afterlife, but the current Pope says pets go to heaven, and that comforting. We left his bed and favorite toy and his blanket right where they were when he died. It been a year and a half, and they haven moved. I think they always be there. I kept one of the tags from his collar and made it into a bracelet, so he will always be with me when I need him.
Trauma varies by person. Trauma varies by event. Trauma varies in repetition, type, and effect. It is common for trauma to take decades of healing. It is average for it to take years. It is not unheard of for trauma to require a lifetine of healing, and some people never truly recover. Those who do not find the healing they need are martyrs that stand as a testament to the atrocious impact trauma makes, helping open the eyes of those blessed to never know such pain themselves. Every story shared brings us all closer to closure and peace. Every heart touched is another string in the tapestry of recovery, weaving a warm cloak to help ease the cold pain of enduring trauma in solitude.

Edit again to add: turns out she just wants to keep google from advertising its own products and services on its platform. A far cry from a breakup (also not especially meaningful).

To determine if a tournament is worth playing, the quick back of the envelope calculation is  x 30% roi based on your stats divided by the average number of hours (which changes based on winrate and tournament structure). In this case the likely upper end of your expected profit would be $18/avg number of hours played, which I assume is 2+ hours if your roi is good   less than minimum wage. By way of comparison, I imagine that $20/hour is doable at 1/2 with that rake structure..

Then she walks with him in DC, but still leaves with her boyfriend. Then she stays with him in his house and finally sleeps with him, after that one critical moment.

As a data point, I know a small group of professional online poker players   about 5 people. They treat it very much as a business, with strict self imposed rules about bookeeping, data sharing, how much of the winnings get re invested, even regular(ish) working hours. They say it's not actually that much fun, but it's their only job and they're able to pay themselves fairly consistent and very comfortable wages. "Rakeback"   a cut of the table's profits paid to them because they're so active on the site   helps to add stability to their income.

But critics of the Abenomics strategy question whether consumers, whose purchasing power and real wages also have been declining for more than two decades, are really willing or even able to change their behavior and begin spending more. Abe was grilled by the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) Banri Kaieda in Parliament in mid April on the link between inflation and the higher wages and hiring needed to ensure that the economy takes off. Abe merely pointed to the change in atmosphere in Japan since he took over from the DPJ Yoshihiko Noda as prime minister in December. Generally, LDP members sidestep such questions, though they say they will reconsider a planned increase in the sales tax if it appears likely that it would undo any progress toward recovery.

To be fair, a lot of sex workers in the US are human trafficking victims.

This is getting into the nitty gritty, but some of the vowels that are the "same" between American English and Brazilian Portuguese (or any other two languages, for that matter) are in fact not exactly the same. For example, the English phoneme /i/ occupies a narrower range in the vowel space (if we conceive of the vowel space as being a two dimentional grid with the first and second formants as axes) because of the contrast with the nearby vowel //. Brazilian Portuguese lacks this contrast and so its /i/ occupies a slightly wider range in the vowel space.
