Zeno/netero get blitzed by meruem, and later netero only manage to deal with his speed by putting like 50 100 meters of distance between them (and because he only need to react to trigger is near instantaneous attack), and even then if he miss once he doesn have time to react. By my estimation I put meruem speed loosely around mach 5 (give or take a few mach). Maybe alita feat have the edge though, but I don think it one order of magnitude above meruem. what the "mental emptiness" mentionned use to trick rakan?

Dad worked two jobs to move ahead, he rebuilt our tiny house into a four bedroom one and as the oldest I got to be his assistant. It didn't matter that I was terrified of heights or of bugs, I was more terrified of disappointing dad and incurring wrath so I stood on the scaffolding and handed him tools, turned the handle on the lathe as he sharpened saws and spent summers sawing and chopping wood with my siblings and winters straightening crooked nails as he recycled a barrel of nails that must have come from Coal Creek. Summers were worked in the field where Isabella Dicken School now sits, as the property was leased for gardening and dad planted a huge garden that we weeded and harvested while our friends went by having fun..

To understand why greenhouse gases are harder to fix, and you need at least double the yearly energy expenditure to go neutral, understand that 80% of the world energy comes from fossil fuels. Produces 50 pounds of CO2 for every one pound of trash generated. CO2 is a heavy molecule with extra oxygen atoms for every carbon in the original carbon chain and it is relatively diffuse, so it is hard to capture and move.

It started about two or three years ago after a critical mass of people with various symptoms came to our clinic, and the numbers of these particular people increased exponentially at that time. Though they had symptoms similar to Celiac Disease, they did not have Celiac Disease. We would give them a negative diagnosis for celiac disease, but they kept coming back with the same symptoms. Many had started a gluten free diet on their own, and the gluten free diet seemed to be a cure, a miracle. We had reached the conclusion that though this group of people did not have Celiac Disease, there must be something else happening that is gluten related.

If races were real, then they would kinda sorta be like animal breeds. That is, if you take two random, living, purebred individuals of breed A, call them A1 and A2, and one random, living, etc individual of breed B, then you are guaranteed that A1 and A2 are more closely related to each other than either one is to B. And the reason that is so is because breeds were purposefully engineered.

The enormous cast of characters is sometimes rather confusing, but film is unfussy and straightforward, relentlessly entertaining as it piles on wry comedy and dark feeling. Green walks off with the movie as the staggeringly ruthless Ava, vamping through each scene without bothering to put on any clothing while revealing her own weaknesses along the way. Her scenes with Brolin are surprisingly involving emotionally, as is the desperation that pushes Alba's and Gordon Levitt's characters, two tenacious young people trying to right the wrongs of their past, probably without any hope of success. Because this is a politician they're dealing with, and we all know how impossible it is to clean up a corrupt system. Manuel, Alexander Rodnyansky

Neighbors say prostitution was at its worst last summer. Now that spring weather has arrived, there are signs it's about to get more so. "With some of the warmer weather happening last month, the activity was definitely starting to warm up," says Corrie Zoll, executive director of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre on Lake. "Now that I have a year under my belt of seeing it, it's obvious how sophisticated these operations are."
The enormous ship as measuring stick is interesting, and the appearance of the ship amidst buildings is very attractive in a Dadaist sort of way, as an artistic non sequitur. That said, here another example, this from the Scientific American for 25 July 1908, showing what was estimated to be the maximum height (based on foundation and framing) of the still relatively new architectural ideal of the skyscraper.

You have probably used "they" to refer to a singular person before but didn't realize it. It's commonly used when the perceived gender is not known and the person in question is not visible. It feels weird when you see someone that looks like a man or looks like a woman and not refer to them with a masculine or feminine pronoun. Even when we see the person and the gender is ambiguous, it feels strange to give them a plural pronoun. It only feels right when the person isn't seen, but it is the best option.
Speaking of Jessie, she been steadily working her way up the rankings. She been in the top 10 six times (out of 17 Iditarods) so maybe this is her year!

Children are curious/receptive and will, even without seeing a single bit of TV, pick up on those two women who are living together down the road or the two men were giving each other a kiss at the bus stop, or anything else for that matter, or even why they themselves feel they like boys/girls like themselves or whatever (a couple of gay people I met knew even as young kids they liked other dudes/girl so). 
When switching from clarinet to saxophone (any saxophone   soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, etc), this set embouchure makes a difference. Saxophone embouchures are much more loose and changeable. It is impossible to get low notes out immediately coming from a clarinet background, because the embouchure is too tight. High notes usually go very sharp. In fact, most of the notes are sharp right off the bat. It takes time and practice to relearn an embouchure.
Also, the Top 100 players, based on their performance in WSOP bracelet events in the past two years, will also be given the opportunity to buy into this event. Those players will need to pay the full $10,000 fee in order to participate. The stellar list includes the likes of 14 time WSOP bracelet winner Phil Hellmuth, who is expected to play the event.

But this begs the question: why do you need to know duration? Is it for sprint planning? Then you don need duration, you need effort because you can derive velocity from effort and sprint work is measured in terms of velocity (points per sprint). Is it for release planning? Then you can derive duration from velocity; the release will take (Total Points / Velocity) sprints times the length of a sprint (+/  for the Cone of Uncertainty that will narrow as you progress)..

There hasn been any significant reflection on how the electoral college works or why it even necessary for the entire countries history. If America wasn satisfied with it system they would have done something about it,just like America would have elected a different candidate if Trump didn represent us properly. Unless you arguing that democracy itself doesn choose the best candidate which is true and entirely irrelevant considering it the system we chose and thought was "the best". There literally millions of Americans that would be a better president and yet the American public wouldn vote for them.
Playing tight means folding over 90% of your hands in the first three rounds. If this sounds boring, well, it is, but keep in mind that the biggest sit and go winners at the highest stakes only play slightly more hands than this, perhaps 15% or so. From early and middle position (first five positions from first to act) you should fold everything but AK and a pair of jacks or better.

I may be completely off here but judging by the fact that for some people resolve the issue by either taking the side of their case off, maxing their fan speed on their gpu, lowering fps_max, lowering the texture streaming setting, increasing power performance to "prefer max performance" in nvidia control panel, disabling their 2nd monitor, closing discord or in my case minimizing discord and usually it hardware accelerated by the gpu. It seems very likely that the crash is caused by mismanagement/lack of GPU resources or a sudden dip in GPU performance. Considering all of those options either improve cooling performance and thus decreases the chance a GPU will underclock itself from getting to hot, provides maximum power for the GPU to utilize or just using less GPU resources.. 
This is admittedly an extremely simplistic strategy, but it is actually not too far from correct early game play in sit and go tournaments at any stakes. Most of the positive expectation is in these bread and butter big hands, since there is less incentive to push with marginal hands in this type of structure.

Religion actually encourages this way of thinking, too. Believers are taught that they are crusaders and martyrs, ambassadors in a world that is bound to reject them. The fact that the Bible states that the world will reject faith and belief in god just strengthens the believer convictions when it actually happens, too. "Aha, the Bible was right that non believers would try to dissuade me from my beliefs, therefore it must be right on the other things as well!" Obviously an oversimplified exaggeration, but you get it. This "proof" generally makes them feel emboldened and they will double down and dig in their heels.

You should really read the replies above on pro choice; they are extremely enlightening. Not everyone chooses to have sex and they end up pregnant; what about incest and rape situations? What about a very young girl whose life would be at risk? Or any pregnant woman whose life would be at risk if she carried the baby to term? Just because people abuse the system (what system is used perfectly?) does that mean that there is no gray areas? Also, accidents happen with regards to sex. Condoms fall off, pills dont work, vasectomies are not a 100% guarentee.

This is much easier with certain items than with others. For example, art, artifacts, collectibles. If I have a painting, or Marlon Brando jacket from some movie, or a set of armor used in some historical battle, those are far more subjectively valued than say a modern car or a house, where the government can say "hang on, your neighbour house is very similar to yours and only sold for 1/3rd as much, that sounds off." Say that you wanted to reduce your taxable income.

Yet he almost didn make it to the starting line. Fifteen minutes after submitting his entry, McHugh (manager of Supermac in Claremorris and Ballinrobe) was called to a fire at his place of work in Ballinrobe. Were it not for the fire brigade speedy intervention, there would have been no card playing. Then he arrived in Dublin the following day to discover that his draft entry had gone AWOL. Thankfully, proof of postage had been secured and four Mayo entrants (McHugh, his cousin Brendan, Eamonn Walsh and Niall Higgins from Kiltimagh) took their places as the action got under way.

On paper the couple is wealthy. property market values their home at $2 million and their rural cottage at $650,000. That 6.4 times their $414,000 total financial assets including cash. There is only one liability a $150,000 mortgage on the cottage. Their net worth is thus $2.9 million. But their incomes are modest and they face a retirement that, they fear, will be pinched. The solution: turn some of their pricey property into cash.

The Parisian, as the name suggests, has taken its inspiration from France and tries to offer a French ambiance. Besides a half scale recreation of the Eiffel Tower, which is equivalent to a 38 storey building, the French element is visible in the restaurants that offer cuisine typical of the of lights alongside the cakes and patisseries.

The problem is that socialist can let this be another example of socialism failing.Again, refer to the article above if you having trouble understanding. Who owns a company has nothing to do with what the government of a planned economy is doing. Chavez appropriated those companies to their workers, but then he implemented price controls.What if he hadn done the second part? Would there still be a problem? If you refer to my list of worker cooperatives from my last post, you should have your answer.that tried to provide cheap prices to the people, instead of the for profit method used in the rest of the world.Huh? You can have a successful company without owners that extract labor value? Trying to fix commodity prices  socialism.

Okay a side note from me NOT from this particular article. Some people can't drink coffee because of their immune system mistakes coffee for gluten, triggering a reaction.It has been reported that a 200 milliliter cup of roasted ground coffee supplies approx 200 to 675 milligrams of CPP.The daily intake of CPP by a coffee drinker is as much as l gram.Researchers fed rats a high fat diet, and administered the rats coffee polyphenols that were without caffeine.Something fascinating happened! The study found that long term intake of CPP significantly suppressed visceral and liver fat accumulation that was induced by a high fat diet. CPP also helped the plasma glucose, insulin concentrations, and increased energy expenditure.Very interesting discoveries were made. Analysis of the adipose tissue revealed that CPP fed mice had smaller adipocytes (fat cells) than the mice fed a high fat diet without the CPP.Energy expenditure evaluated by indirect calorimetry was significantly increased in CPP fed mice.CPP also down regulated lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue.This study demonstrated that coffee polyphenols can have added effects on fat loss.American Journal Physiol Endocrinol Metab, 2010 Oct 13 by down regulating SREBP 1c and related molecules in C57BL/6J mice.

Being there. It sounds easy enough, but your friend will want someone to listen and ask how he/she doing. Usually what happens when one's child is diagnosed with autism, it pushes the parents and the child into isolation. It's not that the parents want to be isolated, but it's just that sometimes parents are so busy with autism activities and therapies, it doesn't leave much time for anything else. Offering to come over for a cup of coffee or to get together just to talk can be one of the best ways to help your friend get out of his/her autism bubble and combat the isolation.

The weighted risk difference in perineal traumas that required suturing was  0.23 (95% CI:  0.35,  0.11) in favour of avoiding episiotomy, compared with liberal episiotomy (n=4,631). This is equivalent to an absolute decrease of 23% in the risk of sutured perineal trauma. Avoiding routine episiotomy in 4.4 women would prevent one case of perineal trauma that required suturing. The risk difference was similar when the only trial of median episiotomy was excluded. There was significant heterogeneity between the trials that was not eliminated by excluding any one trial. When including only the 3 trials with a high quality score, the risk difference was reduced to  0.14 (95% CI:  0.27, +0.01), but there was still significant heterogeneity. No difference was shown in anal sphincter trauma (n=4,650).

Or even if it was just thrown into an overall voting bill that had good provisions for increasing access (making voting a national holiday in all states, automatic registration, increased voting hours/days, etc) as a compromise.

No double standard, if it was the male talking about how can seem to get a woman unless he buys expensive gifts I give a similar sort of story to him   something like using money as a crutch to more wholesome ways of bonding with someone would result in reinforcing behaviours (give moar gifts!) and ways of thinking (women as transactions; more object like than person like). You [the male] become less skilled at bonding with women in wholesome ways.

According to a Democratic Peace Party spokesman, China is about to bring online next year, 113 more coal plants and 227 trash incinerating plants in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, on the Chinese eastern coastline across South Korea which could practically double the problem of air pollution for South Korea next year. We don have to accuse China of anything to cause a fight. Why can the government approach China in a friendly manner and at least talk to them about these new facilities that are about to come online, which will practically kill us all? At least talk to them and show our concern, and offer to help or even offer to pay for better pollution controls for these plants if they refuse to stop the building of these plants..

Trump things so highly of himself that he believes he can "tell if they're lying" or not. He truly thinks he's smart enough and savvy enough to know when another person is lying and has such a deep seated belief in his own abilities, that he can't fathom them being able to lie to him.

But it has to be pointed out that no one has done more to corrupt it than those who flew their own twisted flags under the guise of red and gold. Communism and socialism at their core are not militaristic and the genocides committed by Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Kim Il Sung, etc have done enough to make an onlooker judge the ideology before learning about it.

I'm more or less in agreement with your conclusions here. As far as demographic shifts are concerned, I think the statistics you cited wrt second amendment sentiment is a symptom of the highly autocorrelated nature of political opinions, and thus their surveys. To me, the solution is to work with those who I may agree with on other issues to improve education and critical thinking regarding the second amendment. The ballot box is too late to do that   you're already voting on too aggregate a platform to send an effective message about one issue. So instead, I do what I'm doing here. I visibly demonstrate the degree to which liberalism is compatible with supporting the second amendment. "I think undocumented immigrants should be able to own guns" is a hell of a thought starter.

I love shorthanded because you (a) see more more hands which increases the opportunities to exploit a skill edge (b) get to play looser and play more interesting hands which also lets you use that skill edge and (c) way more elbow room. Anybody here refuse to play shorthanded or know of any reason other than "I wanna see the most hands possible without paying blinds" ?. 
Love mixing different design styles, says Jill. Cups were passed down from my mother and grandmother, and after my mother passed away I gave a set to each of my close girlfriends to remind them of her. 
Still today, thousands of online poker players think you cannot read anyone in cyberspace. This is hardly the case, but in doing so it points back to concentrating on the game.

Okay first thing   deep breath! You will be okay, even if you have HPV. There are literally over 100 strains of this SUPER common virus, nearly 80% of people have it in some form. HPV exists not only as genital warts etc but also that wart on your knee or it could be in your body and you don know it at all. There is a huge stigma about it.

When the scrub is complete, be sure to apply it to wet or damp skin. The best time to exfoliate is in the shower so that you can rinse the scrub off after application. Apply the scrub directly to your skin and rub it in circular motions with your fingers; you can also use a washcloth or loofah. Remember the circular motion helps to distribute the caffeine to eliminate cellulite and varicose veins.
Before we had the subreddit, we had the BestOf Posts. LAOP makes about $96K per year via YouTube, and their parents have taken their money but not paid taxes on it. When the police arrived, they advised that speaking Spanish is fine, but she could potentially be arrested for causing a public disturbance. LAOP came home to a paralyzed dog. The culprit's parents are threating to sue for slander. Turns out OP helped a friend out of an abusive relationship in 2003, resulting in the guy going to jail. Now, the same guy is out, impersonating OP on social media, and pretending to be a pedophile. LAOP posted their experience on social media and it went viral. Now the dental office is threatening LAOP. It entirely possible that she did misunderstand him, but, yes, that means that massage parlor engages in prostitution. Probably not a great defense in court, might be worthwhile though if prostitution has a lesser sentence and/or keeps her off the sex offender registry.

He goes searching for action with the same lunacy and indifference to money as Stu Ungar, Jack Strauss and the old Texas gamblers who were capable of betting on any event at any price. At the same time, Ivey maintains a presence in online and televised poker, building the kind of reputation and public profile that is considered the hallmark of professional players in the 21st century. Despite this, he rarely makes self promotional media appearances, relying instead on an audacious playing style and sixth sense to fortify his place at the top of the poker community.. 
No surprise. All the supposed "Job Offer" emails students have received originated from China, the last major campus hacks originated from China, and Chinese international students have the highest rates of repatriation upon graduation. It's not to say that all Chinese international students have nefarious reasons for attending UTD, but China has notoriously sent foreign agents to academic institutions in the past with the purpose of spreading anti western sentiment, and stealing proprietary university information..

Also, it a typical narrative when it comes to how the British establishment views and treats the Irish. Take the Northern Irish border, it under threat right now, and from the same stage.

I can definitely relate to you regarding this. There is nothing wrong with separating these parts of your personality. Some people will say that it "fake" or "not genuine," but it just a matter of who you decide to reveal the deeper aspects of your personality to. Being open and intimate with your problems should only be reserved for people who are truly close to you and who genuinely care about you as a person, and that just comes with time. Our humor and outgoing personalities should serve to attract and filter others. As Dr. Seuss said, "Those who matter don mind, and those who mind don matter." Hope this helps.

That a great trip. You don say how many days you want to go for so it makes it hard to make a recommendation. Also, realize that the most popular backpacking trips are in the corridor between Tuolumne Meadows and Yosemite Valley so it can be hard to score a permit there although you can also try for a FCFS permit when you get there. You need to introduce yourself, make small talk, which means flirting and teasing, and if you seem to have chemistry you tell her (not ask) to give you her number. Wait 4 5 days and call her and ask her on a date for "a drink and to get to know each other." Use the word "date". The date should cost less than $20, and focus explicitly on the two of you sitting, talking, and getting to know each other. I recommend drinks at a quiet, upscale bar. If she accepts, great. If she makes any excuses, she not into you. Get rid of her number and move on. Spend no more than an hour and see if you get along.

Big 2 is a game that my friends and I like to play when we have a deck of cards handy. Some people call this game Chinese Poker because it originated in Asia. People in the East may know it as Giappuniza or Ciniza. This game uses common poker hands in a new and different way. The game can be played with any amount of players, but it is best when there is between three and five participants. The rules for a two player game are a little different than a game with more players. Scroll down to see the rules for the two player version.

I would like to see Arab leaders act as responsible people and honest in running constructive talks with the US administration that arebased on the interests of Arabs. To the best of my knowledge and critical reading of history, Palestine is not more than a logo for those who run their businesses. Palestine is the price of having so many regimes that serve the immediate and long term interests of the super power   the US.

Just to be totally clear, he was the first black neuropsychologist to receive board certification in the US. It not the case (in the US) that only board certified neuropsychologists are neuropsychologists. Also there are two major US boards for adult neuropsychologists and one (maybe more?) for pediatric neuropsychologists.

Plastic containers and bottles that hold our food and water may be slowly poisoning us. In the study that first got my attention, the American Academy of Pediatrics called out to parents to rethink using plastic products for their kids. Bisphenols   chemicals used to coat metal food cans and plastic containers to prevent corrosion   are absorbed by the food that they protect, can decrease fertility by mimicking estrogen in the body, cause weight gain, and interfere with neurologic development in children.

A BA role is not recognized in Agile and tbh, in my experience, is exactly the same responsibility as a PO. I mentioned that a BA doesn't do prioritization, but that's not really true from what i've seen; it's just where i can see there possibly being a difference. Usually BAs help the PM/PO make prioritization decisions..

Under what rationale would you justifiably be able to break them up? There are other options, they just aren as good. Amazon is essentially the largest supply and shipping conduit for the country, so you would be throwing our economy for a huge loop.

Educate me instead of insulting me. That the goal right? Not to alienate people but to bring them to a point of understanding and hopefully, eventually, acceptance. That literally what the comment chain I was posting in was about when I got banned. I wasn trying to "further a narrative", I was simply pointing out that people have done bad things while pretending to believe in the ideology.

I had a similar experience except the faulty work was hired by me on my property by basically scam artists. Went down every legal road we could. Literally the only option left for us is to file for small claims, but these scam artists likely wouldn pay even if we won, so we decided to just cry it out and be thankful it wasn worse.

Get by with 60m double ropes and a single rack, and usually the ropes are too long but it makes abseiling much easier. Anything in Snowdonia you either wanna arrive late and sleep in your car, hostel it or arrive at the asscrack of dawn because good weather days and every hill walker is hogging the parking.

Americans took on this debt not because we stupid, but because we suffer from what economists call "optimism bias." We always think things will be better in the future. If I finance this college degree, I be better off (but 1/2 of all student loan takers NEVER finish college).

It's not, they're just seats that generally should be given to people with more serious needs like disabilities, elderly, pregnancy etc, but you're free to sit in them when there are other empty seats around)

Bankroll size suggestions range from 200 times the big bet at the level you are playing to 300 times the big bet. These amounts may seem like large numbers, but the fact is that even consistent winning professional poker players have downswings in their bankroll that may sometimes reach 200 times the big bet of the limits at which they are playing. Any number of factors or a combination of factors may cause these downswings. They include a run of bad cards, poor play for one reason or another, poor game or table selection, or health issues.
