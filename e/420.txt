There's been a lot of excellent analysis and advice about the really awful sexual abuse that your husband has been regularly dishing out. I'm going to let all of that stand, and instead, focus upon the substance abuse that pervades his daily routine and anti social behaviors after he's "had a few". I'm a recovering addict, so addiction related issues are the things that really jump out to me. I'm not at all impressed with his claims that he "has to" include hours upon hours of bar hopping after most days at his job. Sure, every office has that part of the staff who like to go out to happy hours after work, ostensibly to create "team spirit" and "talk business". But let's be real here. It's just an excuse to party during the week.

And then I think; if this had happened to my family, and my entire community, would I want to deal with a "Child Services" agency that was underfunded, and sought only to worry about the kids? Or would I want there to be a "Functional Families" organization that sought to teach me the skills I missed due to previous policies, and support my family in healing from generations of trauma?

You can compare a new game to games on a console that had far more limitations. Most games on the NES are bordering unplayable these days, just because they were primitive or designed to drain pockets and time. I recently started playing the Dragon Quest series from the beginning, and I went into the beginning realizing that I was in for a headache. But I ended up enjoying myself despite the limitations. But each game still had its own defining features. DQIII is probably my favorite in the series so far while II is largely considered the worst.

They are called poker bots. And rumor has it, they are bleeding you dry.

It a flawed democracy. No amount of freedom guarantees fair and honest people ruling the country. No amount of free elections guarantees there will be competition. Just because the country isn split in two over every single issue doesn make it a dictatorship.

And of course, Obama and his military were very very cautious about avoiding civilian deaths.

I was in high school when that movie came out and I saw it. I hadn't been exposed to mental illness too much by that point in my life and my perception of what the movie was going to be about was more about a genius who ended up dealing with some spy stuff and got in over his head. I believe I also knew that the movie was "based on a true story". As I watched I was fascinated with how smart this man was and the incredible experiences he was having. I really was on his side and thought that there people after him. It didn't click in my head until nearly the end of the movie that he was really suffering was schizophrenic delusions and was not being conspired against by the Soviets. It definitely blew my mind. It read a bit about the guy it was based on afterward and I really felt bad for the guy.

I'm just happy Wayne didn't blow his brains out. After he remembered that he had pretty much known all along when they finished interviewing junious watts and Rolands said something like "you good buddy. Will you be fine for the night", I thought for sure Wayne was going to walk back to his study and end it. I think normally this would have been the end plot line, but I am really impressed how Nic Pizzolatto incorporated Alzheimer's/dementia into the story. The haunting thing about those diseases is it is so invasive and destructive to those who have it but somehow it seems it affects their loved ones and families even more. I think it is because we think so highly of these people who have endured through so much and worked their whole lives not just to provide for themselves but their whole families, and then they are stricken with this diseases that rapidly destroys their mental state and the ones who looked up to and admired them see them wither into a shell of themselves. Hopefully, with the advances in medicine and technology we will be able to figure out and find a cure for those who have to endure through these horrible mental diseases.

I am quick to think critically about challenges, and specifically considering possible explanations for why other humans respond/react/behave the way they do. Not that I can read what someone's been through, but I easily pause to consider that I don't know what they're story is and think about what experiences might have shaped their life and perspective. This definitely helps me keep my cool in situations. I'm also not bad at challenging others to consider these things, that's ma favorite part.

Obviously I disagree with you. It wasn "opinion" in the sense that there was no argument to it. It was just pure and simple propaganda. Biden a smart guy. He could have said "many people of good conscience disagree with out economic policies. here are the sorts of criticisms leveled at us. here why we doing what we doing despite these criticisms." I think the Times Op Ed editor could have said: more argument less propaganda please, Mr. Vice President. Most "opinion" pieces contain real evidence and real argumentation. Unless they comedic. Maybe Biden was doing a spoof of a politician writing an Op Ed?

Yes, there a great mix of paces from 3hr folks all the way to 5+run/walk groups. I was in one of the slowest run groups last fall (and was usually the only guy in my group). I found that being put into a pacing group (based on recent race results) helped me with pacing issues a lot. 
When you already have the best hand, you can only lose if your opponent(s) hit their out, which means they improve to having the best hand. Therefore, calculating equity is cumbersome since you do not know the hand of the opponent. You can however 'read' his hand based on the board, betting tells, past behaviors, etc. When you have a solid read, say he is drawing to a flush on the flop, you know that he has a chance of 0.35 to improving and therefore you have a winning chance of 0.75 ( with for example a pair of aces.

We study a simplified version of full street, three player Kuhn poker, in which the weakest card, J, must be checked and/or folded by a player who holds it. The number of nontrivial betting frequencies that must be calculated is thereby reduced from 23 to 11, and all equilibrium solutions can be found analytically. In particular, there are three ranges of values of the pot size, P, for which there are three distinct, coexisting equilibrium solutions. We also study an ordinary differential equation model of repeated play of the game, which we expect to be at least qualitatively accurate when all players both adjust their betting frequencies sufficiently slowly and have sufficiently short memories. We find that none of the equilibrium solutions of the game is asymptotically stable as a solution of the ordinary differential equations. Depending on the pot size, the solution may be periodic, close to periodic or have long chaotic transients. In each case, the rates at which the players accumulate profit closely match those associated with one of the equilibrium solutions of the game.

Sure Obama installed experts into his administration. Sure some of them aren't perfect. Obama wasn't a kleptocracy, like trump. Obama did more for the people in a bad situation than trump has in a good situation. Before you start stating "what about the economy" it's easy to see Trump is selling our long term, debt, for short term economy. And only right now are we starting to be in the trump economy. So we will see if this lasts. The debt creator during good times historically has killed the economy. Overall, I dislike any and all corruption so yeah I hated any hint of it with Obama. Far fewer hints of this. It's hysterical you a have twisted the blame for trumps leaks on Obama. Obama was harder on leakers than any previous president. I didn't like him for this. Yet somehow you have managed the mental gymnastics to make Trump leaks Obama's fault. Hilarious. Overall Obama's team obeyed the law. You list fast and furious as a peak of corruption. It was a gun deal gone bad to catch gun runners. An undercover gun smuggling deal gone bad is the peak of Obama's administration "bad deal" or corruption . Like that even holds a candle to the Obstruction of Justice, the 36 indictments. You have this tin foil hat view of the world which doesn't exist.

One famous recipient of this so called West Cure was Teddy Roosevelt, so we guess at least that version of Mitchell's treatment wasn't total bullshit..

Tl;dr   Boomers became conservative because it allowed them to keep hold of their wealth, and they have continued to vote in ways that continually benefits them alone, and since they were the largest voting block by far whatever they wanted to happen, happened.

Millennials are a bigger voting block than boomers now, add Gen X to that and Boomers should be pushed aside easily.

The basic bluff goes like this: You have nothing. Your opponents may have nothing. You bet. They fold. Sometimes it's difficult even to make people throw away an inside straight (where the missing card is in the middle of the four on the table). They keep hoping. Know your opponents. Everyones chances of hitting a four card open straight is twice as likely, because it has a place open at either end to complete the hand; for example, a hand of 4 5 6 7 can use either a 3 on the left end or an 8 at the other to complete the straight. But, an inside straight only has one space somewhere in the middle that must be filled to complete the hand; 4 6 7 8 needs a 5 and nothing else to become a straight (half as likely).

Even if you cooking your own food, say $10 $15 / meal (blue apron) on average, and let be honest here I can spend $15 at Chipotle, you talking several hundred a month on food.

Those sets of rules, as well as poker secrets, tend to cause a number of these normally outstanding athletes to believe the poker online is rigged. Although Texas Holder must be a game title of talent, every time a personal computer is figuring out your poker hands and wrists, extreme caution should be worked out even if you understand how to perform as an specialist. The reasoning right behind way too many suckouts in online poker and poor beats is because of the poker requirements which control many facets of the video game.

This long standing tradition of sex workers providing non sexual entertainment paved the way for the modern day notion of outcall entertainment. Workers in a Las Vegas escort service provide a number of services beyond the simple exchange of sex for money; indeed, such prostitution is not even part of their official job description, which is how Las Vegas escorts continue to work within the city limits.. 
These studies suggest that exercise could hasten the reappearance in the central circulation of leukocytes conditioned by the local environment of the lung,spleen, and muscle providing a potential mechanism through which tissues like muscle could influence immune function systemically.This speculation is consistent with a growing body of data from air pollution to surgery, that local triggers can influencesystemic immune cell function (den Hartigh et al., 2010; Landis,2009; Menzies et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2002).Circulating leukocytes increase rapidly with exercise then quickly decrease when the exercise ends.We tested whether exercise acutely led to bidirectional interchange of leukocytes between the circulation and the lung, spleen, and active skeletal muscle.To accomplish this it was necessary to label a large number of immune cells (granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes) in a way that resulted in minimal perturbation of cell function.Rats were injected intravenously with a single bolus of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester (CFSE) dye which is rapidly and irreversibly taken up by circulating cells.The time course of the disappearance of labeled cells and their reappearance in the circulation following exercise was determined via flow cytometry.The majority of circulating leukocytes were labeled at 4h.

Students with a student loan can claim a non refundable tax credit in 2018 for the amount of interest paid by Dec. 31 on student loans received under the Canada Student Loans Act, the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, the Apprentice Loans Act or a similar provincial or territorial government law.

"The indictment did not include officials from accounting firms that created false documents for Kabul Bank, airline employees that smuggled money out of Afghanistan, or shareholders who received funds from loans at zero interest, apparently without the intention of repayment," the report said.
I feel you. Nothing like living in a high rent building and playing the "can I use my front door or is the dealer and his pit bulls in the way" game, or "whose turn it is this time to call the cops on the meth heads blasting their stereo/abusing a guitar and wailing at the top of their lungs outside your window at 3:00 AM." We lived in the same, insanely convenient location for years and are finally packing up and leaving as soon as our lease is up. It not my neighborhood anymore, it the meth heads neighborhood now. I can take it. The physical effects of even a "good" complication free pregnancy and delivery ALONE are way, WAY too high a price to pay to "pass on my genes." Maybe I'd feel differently if I were a man   able to stay in the gene pool with no permanent damage or disfigurement what so ever to the only body I'll ever have, but the way things are? Hell no.

Studies often are used to distinguish between environmental and genetic influences on medical disorders. Identical twins share nearly 100 percent of their genes, and fraternal twins share about half of their genes.In both cases the siblings early developmental environment   both in the womb and after birth are very similar.Several small twin studies in the past decade looked at how common it was for twin siblings to share an autism diagnosis, and results of those studies placed genetics as the primary cause of autism.But some scientists believe that those studies weren large enough to note the differences in shared diagnoses rates between identical and fraternaltwins.The new study is the largest, and the most diverse, to look at twins.Of the 192 pairs of twins in the study, 54 were identical and 138 were fraternal.

We tend to suffer from hindsight bias, and the assumption that recent history will continue to repeat itself. This bias can apply to investing, health, salary, or any past occurrence. The Saving Regret research suggests that a retirement savings plan should include a margin of error related to negative shocks and try to insure against them.

"Forcing use of cash" and "banning cashless stores" are two different things. In most developed Western countries, an all cash lifestyle is for druggies, MGTOW nutters, and the very poor. The poor were the issue when these types of bans are written, because the only way for a poor person to get access to cashless payment systems is to use one of those predatory pre paid charge cards, which I think most reasonable people can agree is kinda fucked up..
