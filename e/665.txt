Using C++ and i5 CPU I personally get about 4.4 million hands/s in Monte Carlo with 3 players and 2.3 million with 6 players. But that's just raw unoptimized Monte Carlo. Brute force enumeration goes at the rate of 190M hands/sec. So your 205,476,480 boards don't look too scary to me. This number is actually wrong: you should have calculated it as combin(48,5) = 1,712,304. At 190M/sec that's an instant. So I can assume that the bottleneck is hand evaluation algorithm.

"This detached way of representing things," he remarked, "seems to me to suggest a universal style, in which the quirks and little preferences of an individual play no role." It is meat and potatoes figuration, with no pretensions; if there were any pretensions in this world, where flotillas of loaves sail by in the evening sky like flying saucers and an innocent eye opens in the middle of a slice of ham on your plate, they would greatly reduce its credibility.
The probabilistic outcomes change again if we pit these three hands against each other, two at a time. In that case, sixes are slightly more likely to beat Ace 7, and Ace 7 is likely to beat Jack 10 suited, but Jack 10 suited is likely to beat a pair of sixes.

Syria been at the center of a global clusterfuck for a while now, the population has had no education in almost a decade, and has experienced terror on a daily basis.

The Beach Boys is my favorite band and I also really love Animal Collective. If you only listened to Merriweather Post Pavillion, a deep dive into AnCo discography is very much worth your time.

Just make sure you get a good doctor. I had mine done about 18 years ago, and I chose poorly. No major problems, the doctor just wanted me in and out on his assembly line. My vision was never 20 20, even after "enhancement", or as I preferred to call it "correcting your initial screwup". And I chose him even though he did not offer lifetime followup as some other physicians did. Your eyes can change later. I was back in glasses full time in less than 10 years. It worth the extra expense to go back years later and fix it again.

Again, where the hell did you get this idea from anything that I have ever said? If you think this about me, you are sadly mistaken. We are not the Shining City on the Hill Kennedy told us we were. I spent a good part of my military career serving the interests of American companies. But even so, those companies political business sent me to places where my boots on the ground and my rifle enforced decency. I helped end the genocide in Yugoslavia, for instance. That would have never happened had the US not got involved. I am not proud of some of the things I had to do as a solider, but I am also not ashamed of having helped people either.
Just to play devil advocate: that seems like just practical reality. It easier to keep tabs on German and Italians given their shared European background and ubiquity.

This is how the roll should feel. Rolling works best on the lower back.

Another solution to this problem is to simply allow concealed carry permit holders to carry their guns everywhere, so they don't have to stow them be their vehicles. Since this demographic has the single lowest instance of crime out of all those who possess guns, even less than police, this would be more reasonable than leaving the guns to be stolen by these poor kids who really didn't even have a choice but to steal the guns. I mean they were only stored behind multiple locks. It's like the gun owners we're begging them to steal their guns. You might even say they were asking for it.

It is a pungent comment on the strength of the reserves of English cricket half a century ago that Fry and Ranji were both dropped from the England team at the height of their fame. In 1901 Fry scored 3,147 runs, average 78.67; in 1903 he scored 2,683 runs, average 81.30. In 1900 Ranjitsinhji scored 3,065, average 87.57.

On the other hand, recent evidence that shows some families are choosing to have boys over girls has caused a certain amount of angst, at least among the chattering classes.

CCP as a business has to try to grow the game even though players hate that. I don think CCP or the CSM can actually come up wit winning solutions to the games problems since both are driven by different goals.. 
Which means that since the Model 3 can do 606 miles on a single charge, while dealing with 1 Gravity and air resistance. Also, Mars freefall velocity due to air resistance is about 1/3rd that of Earth so factoring those two in, you can extend the model 3 charge up to 836.3 miles per charge accounting only for the gravitic difference and guesstimating the air resistance difference you could arguably say that a Model 3 could get around 1,000 miles (1609km) per charge with no payload attached, and if we assume a significant payload then we can half that and get 500 miles (804.5km) per charge with a model 3 acting like a mini semi on the surface of Mars all through the electric motor with ridiculous torque.

There are a few bad jokes; the two commentators for the poker tournament show effectively that no fake commentators in a film will ever approach the hilarity of Fred Willard in "Best in Show," although it's nice that someone's trying.

Finally, there is a possible phonological Celtic influence on Old English, that is obscured by sound changes within the British Celtic languages themselves. If one were to look solely at the surviving British Celtic languages and contemporaneous ones like Old/Middle Welsh, any phonological influence on Old English would be completely obscured due to the fact that the British Celtic languages underwent significant sound changes beginning around 500/600AD. This means that the hypothetical Lowland Celtic dialects the Anglo Saxons encountered may not even have resembled later Welsh or Cornish, making the potential influence a Celtic British language on English imperceptible if we were only to look at other British languages. However, it may be possible to identify a Celtic influence on Old English sound system through an analysis of Old Irish, of all languages. This is possible if we accept Peter Schrijver thesis that Old Irish is actually Proto Irish that only arrived in Ireland sometime around the Roman Conquest of Britain: this would explain the complete lack of dialectical variation in Old Irish and a series of dramatic sound changes between 400 600 which could be explained by the rapid adoption of Old Irish by an indigenous population who previously spoke another, possibly non Indo European, language.

There is the flipside too: Lazy "dominants." I tired of seeing "doms" who haven spent any time learning the psychological and physiological tricks of the trade. They are too lazy to do the mental and emotional work, so they say they dominant as an excuse to boss partners around. In extreme cases, they are sadists who don realize it, which is sooooo dangerous.

The fight that the SD trolley had to make to get more stops was ridiculous   anyone that ever actually used it knows how amazing it is and would vote for it.

I get that you want to try to bluff other 8s off the hand, but you wrong in thinking that flush draws wouldn have gotten this far, so your shove here is kind of suicidal.The pot on the flop is 6000 and villain still has almost 100k behind. You bet pot and villain could call with a flush draw, which is in fact far more likely that 8x since 8x is just a gutshot and there aren that many combos of 8x that make sense.

Normalized stress hormone levels.30 Early life stress also leads to increased depressive like behavior in adult rats, and a similar study showed that treatment of rats exposed to stress during early life with the probiotic Bifiodo infantis reduced the depressive like symptoms in adulthood.31 Overall these recent studies imply a link among microbiota imbalance, stress related behaviors, and stress reactivity, and also suggest that probiotic treatment may be a good approach to treating stress related symptoms.To date, researchers have done little work related to stress and microbiota in humans, and in particular, there have been no studies that directly link microbiota to depression or anxiety. The most promising of the clinically related work shows that probiotic administration in people may have antidepressant or anxiety reducing effects.
