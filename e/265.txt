This is a law of nature: we are not perfect, we are not mind readers. There will be moments when you misread a situation or when there an obvious lack of communication happening.

FYI the term "net neutrality" started as boiler plate contract language between two ISP or whatever autonomous Internet system (AS). There was a "net neutrality" clause in the contracts, that is where this all started. and it like many other words that have taken on more baggage and meaning over time significantly different than how started.

A white passing person from a Caucasian ethnic group is a white person. Just because ignorant bigots are bigoted against them anyway doesn make them less of what they are. Everyone might have a different idea of what "white" should look like, but your idea of what "white" looks like doesn change someone racial makeup. White Iranian people are not considered white because they simply look white; they white because they scientifically classified as ethnically Caucasian. Much like how even though Ariana Grande has made herself look racially ambiguous because of her deep fake tan and her lip injections and new aesthetic, she still a white Italian woman because she ethnically Caucasian.

He is thought to be just "hanging out" at the bar and seems to mean no harm. Nearly every employee of the bar is said to have seen the old miner, and he is regarded as harmless.

According to a federal study released in 2005, 40 percent of men and 35 percent of women surveyed in 2002 said they have had anal sex with an opposite sex partner. Given that five of my top ten posts all time are about anal sex, I sure the numbers haveonly increased since then. That means that a lot of couples have moved beyond anal sex for beginners and are looking for way to make anal sex even hotter.

They HAD to do it or society would seem them worthless ingrates and they would literally lose their whole family how is that a choice? Me continuing to support them is of course a choice; it a choice I stand by and am frankly proud of.

So it made sense when the entire political spectrum in the National Assembly got on its feet to condemn Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri for their "blackmailing." Tehmina Daultana was at her shrieking best to "let Imran Khan know that a few thousand agitators can't dictate the Parliament which represents 180 million Pakistanis." She had a point when she asked who would bring about the so called revolution   Chaudhary Shujaat, Sheikh Rasheed, Shah Mahmood Qureshi or Jahangir Tareen. Aftab Sherpao smelled a larger conspiracy in the joint strategy of Imran and Tahirul Qadri. 
Yeah batmans kind of a piece of shit for enforcing his weird little "rules" on everyone he meets. This is a dude that has killed many people, escaped jail and batman countless times, and has vowed to kill your family. And your about to finish it.
Well, it usually easier when you initiate the breakup but when I broke up with my ex he prevented any doubts I would have had. I got at least 300 calls from him and a few thousand text messages that ranged from sad and apologetic to angry and threatening. The next day I decided to go hiking with a friend to get away from the stress and didn look at my phone all day until my mother called and asked if I needed to get a ride because he was out looking for me. Apparently he showed up at my house and after I wasn there he went out to the woods to find me. I was terrified. He then got any mutual friends we had to "reason" with me. This is after he has been angry, controlling and isolating for over a year. I tried to end it numerous times but he would threaten to hurt himself. He would take my phone and read my messages and get angry if I talked to anyone without his knowledge. He didn let me spend time with anyone else and even got mad when I went out with my sisters. If I said something he didn like he would snap at me and then be irritable for days. He didn like me wearing certain clothes because I "looked too good in them". He isolated me from my friends and family and made me scared and miserable all the time. And then I became the bad guy when I had the courage to get away from him. When he found out I was seeing someone new, he sent me this message:
The next time she wants to visit, "I'm sorry but we aren't going to give you the opportunity endanger my husband again. You are welcome to visit if you stay in a hotel and rent a car but you are no longer welcome in our house." Even better if you live in an area with a lot of snow, you can flat out refuse during any month in which it might snow (where I live that's October   April). She got her way this time but now she won't have the opportunity to pull the same stunt again. Play bitch games, win bitch prizes.

I hate this obnoxious pussyfooted indifference people of the same ilk have for their own species, like as if the destruction and consumption is something inherently exclusive to humans, destined to fail, but the reality is, with such mental potential, any group with that capacity is going to find themselves in a corner one way or another.

However, with a reactive resin bowling ball you should be about to stand on around the 15th board and put your ball down between the first and second arrow with a very small amount of rotation and it will pick up and hook towards the pocket.

If you have a bank roll of a hundred bucks you don want to be playing in a game where the minimum bet is fifty of it. If you doing it like that then you just trying to get lucky and that is definitely not something you want to do. If you plan on playing professional Texas Holdem you need to minimize the use of luck and maximize the use of skill in the game. To do this a good tip is that you need to have at least thirty to forty max buy ins. That means if you playing the 1$/2$ game the max buy in is probably going to be two hundred bucks. Multiply that by forty and you get 8000. That is a very conservative approach but it definitely is the best one that you can use. If you really serious about becoming a professional poker player this tip a long will take you a long way. Don play above your limits. You can withstand a lot of the aspect of the game and you can consistently beat the levels you are playing at if you just have good bankroll management.

Making money off of fines and such, what economists call the financialization of banks, is exactly the sort of thing that the government should step in and say no to and in many respects the Obama administration has been trying, But fincialization, the idea that it better to make money off of thin air, has been growing as the major source of revenue for banks for decades and it a difficult habit to break. In some ways, fighting fincialization might require a radical restructuring of how we educate young MBAs, a sort of Ethics 101, as well as a lot more federal regulation.

His foray into cave rescue equipment gave me pause: there are a lot of operational considerations that experts in rescue work bring to bear.

What are the oxygen and effort requirements on the divers? Asking experts to use a proof of concept (even on designed by rocket scientists) ignores a lot of he priorities and concerns those experts bring to bear on the situation.

Sheet your airfoil from the leading edge back to at least the spar to create some torsional rigidity and maintain the profile.

Mr. Normandin hit on the idea during the maple syrup harvest in Quebec after he saw someone tap a maple tree and drink sap right from the tree. Mr. Normandin, who has a background in logistics and distribution, tried the water, liked the taste and quickly decided it was something everyone should be drinking.
Letting yourself have a setting with trains is totally cool. Do also think about what other technologies are necessary for trains (you need steel in high quantities, a good energy source to move them, etc.) so that you can make sure they make sense in your overall tech milieu (you don need everything that existed in the 19th century, I don think, but a lot of it will naturally be there).

If they a vet they probably be more expensive, but can diagnose and prescribe treatment. In general a thermographic examination is very very reasonable price wise compared to other diagnostic tools (it be exponentially less than getting the necessary radiographs, by many many times over) and they will often evaluate the entire horse, meaning you may get a wealth of information about problem areas, satellite injuries, even subclinical problems and the evenness of her trim job.or you mentioned I could purchase one.

People think of romance as "natural" and even "universal." the biochemical changes in a person brain when "in love" (or "in lust") may be innate, how we organize the feelings and desires that love arouses are culturally and historically specific.

There is a cutscene in which Revan and Malak are together; the juxtaposition of Malak larger character model with Revan significantly smaller one was a jarring enough visual cue that it made me consider Revan identity and conclude that the only other character I had seen of that physical stature was my own.

GallowBoob started out by posting things that would immediately get a lot of upvotes. He figured it all out and had it down. It wasn too long before redditors noticed that this guy, GallowBoob was posting content specifically engineered to get the most upvotes. He has access to content the general public does not and he knows when the best time to post it is and the best subreddit and title to get the most attention. He figured you all out. He kind of a genius. He could sell his reddit persona for a lot of money if he wanted to now that he has a huge following.

Small talk at the table is generally okay, but a rousing conversation, plus revealing cards or lying about your hand is considered bad etiquette. Unless you're playing with friends, try to limit talking to the occasional comment or light exchange.[3]
Now that we know the number of possible hands, we simply divide the number of royal flushes (4) by the above 2598960: 4/2598960 = 0.000001539, the probability of getting a royal flush in the first 5 cards off the deck.

According to a federal study released in 2005, 40 percent of men and 35 percent of women surveyed in 2002 said they have had anal sex with an opposite sex partner. Given that five of my top ten posts all time are about anal sex, I sure the numbers haveonly increased since then. That means that a lot of couples have moved beyond anal sex for beginners and are looking for way to make anal sex even hotter. Here are five advanced anal sex techniques to try. I think I met some of the insane gentlemen this article is aimed at, so I just hope they always remember the last tip.

A number of studies have shown that conditions of elevated pressure influence athletes' decision quality (Kinrade et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016), response times (Hepler, 2015; Smith et al., 2016) and risk taking (Pighin et al., 2015). However, almost all of this work has been undertaken in nonelite athletes and participants who do not routinely operate under conditions of high stress. 
The population of the online poker site's members should also have a good number so when you log in and would like to play, there would be enough members for you to be able to play with.

Several months ago, I wrote to the organisers, the Ministers for Health and Education, and other stakeholders with my concerns. I included a 15 page Schools Notification Document with detailed documentary evidence of UM risks to children. When I checked the PASH site several weeks ago, Sarah Davis name had been removed from the consortium executive page, so I incorrectly assumed the consortium had the good sense and integrity to make sure she and her colleagues would not be given a platform. After all, numerous community groups, events and institutions across Australiahave ejected UniMed when notified of their toxic teachings, practices and behaviours.

Sounds like you had a good foundation though man. Not sure how to help beyond that. The second layer to PIO use is really trying to find the spots where the pool is playing vastly different from the sim and using that to simplify your strategy. For instance if you knew BU vs BB that the BB overfolded flop turn and river in the BBB line you can start to change any mixed strategy hand from PIO into a pure strategy bluff knowing youre taking advantage of a spot humans play poorly. I sure I gotten at least $500 in value from my PIO licence but its so hard to learn from I dont touch it nearly as much as I should.

It is a well known fact that a disproportionate number of self made success stories find their roots in deprived backgrounds. Could it be that the sting of near starvation once felt will forever haunt and drive a man, and may even drive him to exceptional greatness? Perhaps being born into abject poverty gives the lucky ones who manage to escape a sense of steely, stubborn self determination that makes them fight every second of their existence to never have to return. Can we conceive that Pacquiao feels that he has a sacred duty to pay back for his own good fortune by being the greatest boxer he can, and then to use his fame and fortune to help his fellow countrymen get a fairer deal than he got as a child? Could that be what has driven him to the top? Why not?.

While I think you did a lot to try and set the record straight, I did want to correct one piece. First, you're absolutely right that no carrier out there is trying to screw people out of money that they're entitled to. We want to indemnify (return to the same state prior to the claim) as quickly and efficiently as possible, no more, no less.
The stories themselves are not nearly as romantic, but they do have their comedic moments. An unarmed Scruggs outfoxes a gunman across from a poker table with a maneuver straight out of Looney Tunes.

If they see that you gone from 2NL to 25NL and play X number of hands per week they don have to wonder if you will play enough and study enough to make their effort worthwhile. When browsing offerings/negotiating terms, I definitely advise against putting up 500 EUR in a CFP program. 
Tuqu has four cases: The direct case indicates the syntactic pivot (which is determined by the definiteness and specificity of the verb arguments). 
There are always a million reasons a candidate loses, especially when the race is close, but you cannot possibly deny that attacks from the left hurt Hillary. The whole "release the transcripts" controversy was started on the left, the whole Goldman Sachs contributions was started on the left, a loud minority on the left pushed conspiracy theories constantly online, the "Bernie or bust" movement that didn't allow an inch of support despite a real policy shift last made by Clinton. I'm a Bernie voter, and even I can recognize how toxic Bernie's base became during the end of the primaries.
Which ever one you get, if it has a dial gauge and a mushroom looking weight regulator, get a three piece weight regulator to replace the mushroom looking one. Dial regulators have to be re calibrated every year (and sometimes out of the box), and you need to stay within sight of the canner to make sure it doesn drop below pressure. 
So to play good poker you try to make your opponent make mistakes when possible and cause the math to be in your favor by thinking of odds.
