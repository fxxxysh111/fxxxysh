Quite often cash game plays poorly with shallow stacks. A good example of this is using push/fold charts for stacks greater than 12 big blinds from late position and 10 big blinds from early position. With more than those depths, using a push/fold strategy is drastically inferior to a limp/push/fold strategy from the small blind and button, and a min raise/push/fold strategy from the other positions..

After all betting is completed, a fourth card is dealt face up to each player who has not folded. From this point on, the player with the highest hand showing starts the action. For example, if the high hand (excluding the hole cards) is a pair after the fourth card is dealt, the player with this pair must check (to decline to bet or to pass when it is your turn to act), bet, or fold. Because there is no bring in requirement after the first betting round, players do not need to fold until there is a bet. Once there is a bet, players left in the game, in turn, must call, raise, or fold. It is possible for players to check around the table, thus having a round with no bets.

I would say being able to poke fun at my friends oddly shows we have a strong friendship and are comfortable with each other. It is almost like the relationship evolves at that point. I like to laugh at myself from time to time, so do my friends. If I were to go to a bowling alley and roll a gutter ball my good friends would say something like "NICE shot man" where as people I don't know that well will say something like "Nice try". I would say poking fun at something trivial like bowling builds comradely. I do have very strong friendships that don't have this however. It just depends on the individual and their personality, and what they are looking for in a friendship.

Most people in the west had no idea what a swastika was before Nazi Germany, and after WWII, it came to be associated exclusively with Nazi Germany in the eyes of most Western people, an association that has stuck to this day. The symbol itself is clearly not racist or fascist or negative in any way, and it has many legitimate uses outside of it being a Nazi symbol, but it appropriation by Nazi Germany has stuck that image of it in minds of most people in the west to the point where it difficult to separate the symbol from Nazi Germany.

These are wonderful games for families or groups of hobby gamers. They are simplistic, yet deep.

The lack of options feels limiting but MS really nailed it if you think about it; everything gets auto backed up to the cloud and unlike with the 360, cloud storage on the One is unlimited for savegames. You can still delete savegames (locally or from the cloud also) if you really need/want to.

The title is misleading. There were 1850 patients with TB in total; only 55 had MDR TB, and the headline analysis was actually performed on the 55 people, rather than the 1850 people. Secondly, the finding was one of multiple sub group analyses that were conducted.

I can see where they reported differences in this measure between the Vitamin D and placebo groups, but it means that we don know whether this effect held true for people on optimal treatment, and we don know if the placebo group had more patients that didn have their antibiotic changed.

He oversaw the early days of the general election effort.
I mean ffs Dwight last season destroyed AD KAT Embiid and Capela in one on one matchups and he still has the same post game as he did in Orlando; you can find clips of Barkley saying Dwight's left hook is his best shot, he can be too content to back down from mid range when he does not get good post position instead of passing it out from eight years ago and they still apply now and yet he dropped 25/20 on Capela and KAT and he dropped like 35 on Embiid's head too. Dwight in the more physical era would be even better IMO. He's a physical defender for the current NBA but even compared to like Ewing Robinson etc. I don't think he gives up much strength at all and he truly has good defensive instincts.

NA server player here, I ended rank 3 in flex for the season. I remember some of my queue times for 5s was at least 90 mins with the current system.

From what I can tell, Hoiberg has outcoached his talent level and has brought an offensive style that wouldn be archaic in the NBA (unlike many other philosophies in the college game). Those things are reassuring as far as regular season success goes, but I always looking at the big, playoff picture with these Bulls considering how often a trip to the playoffs is a cakewalk in the East.

The 1940s version is therefore cosier and much less daring. As for Mr Hyde, the transformation and use of split screen works well, but Spencer Tracy is disguised as Hyde by a funny wig, a big nose and forehead prosthetic, which is less effective than the earlier film's stunning make up. Not even someone who is fooled by Clark Kent taking off his glasses to transform into Superman would fail to spot that Jekyll is Hyde.

I genuinely don't understand the daycare bullshit. My son's daycare is my village, his teachers are amazing and have been with him since he was 4 months old. At 18 months old, he knows so many things and has had so many experiences I can directly trace to them. They are such members of the family to us that my mother in law, who has never met them, sent them valentines individually named to each of his seven current and former teachers. I'm not letting someone else raise him, I'm paying a professional for their qualified support just as I do with his doctor. I could afford a nanny; I chose daycare.

The problem with old school, BBC style reporting is that its ridiculous claims to "objectivity" and "neutrality" leave it open to just these kinds of mistakes.

In February last year, prior to the 2015 Cricket World Cup, as a Big Three leader, he called Nawaz Sharif to convey his good wishes, and then as a 'goodwill' gesture sent his new foreign secretary to Pakistan.

But I have a pixel 3 for work travel (google fi works in 140 countries so its really easy to just turn on and start using it) . the iphone xs is for the most part a better phone in everyway , EXCEPT the camera which is so damn awesome on the pixel 3. With that said, does your family all use iphones? Because the biggest thing that keeps me in IOS is mine does and the loss of imessage would be annoying (not impossible but annoying) . Do you own a mac or ipad? Because the apple ecosystem is the most integrated hands down. If no for the above and you don do anything crazy on your phone. Then yes you can switch to pixel 3. If I didn have the family thing I would have already switched to pixel 3 due to cost. I refuse to pay 1000 for a phone so my iphone 8 potentially will be the last one I own. Pixel 3 is constantly on sale so I got it for 600. If I consider what iphone xs gives me , its not worth 400 dollars extra to me.

I hear what you saying and there nothing better than parents trying to do the best thing for their kids. I have all three of my kids in what I think are really great schools. I sure these people are regular people just doing regular good things for their regular kids. But they are doing it in the wrong country. They need to go back their own country, fix whatever problems they ran away from and then aim for their countries version of the American Dream. If they want to come to America and give their kids this life, then please do it the correct way. And to be specific again, the problem here is money. I see how much money I pay for state and federal taxes every year and while it an absurd amount of money, I understand that it going toward paying for the school that my kids attend and the police and fire department and other civil services. I pay my taxes because my family and other Americans reap the benefits.

The advent of high definition and audio may have a hand in it, but it seems like most movies made today are created to induce the most stress possible in an audience. Indeed, many come for that experience.

Movies are full on sensory overload and that's cool, but not all the time.

Nguyen has more than enough XsXs in his range for you to be calling here profitably, and while it obviously way better to have A9/AJ here than 99 (since you block Ax combos) and 99 basically doesn have any blockers to his likely FH combos here   unless you throw in A9 suited in there which even if it is in his range would be incredibly unlikely since between you and the board there only ONE combo of A9s   (UTG+1 range), I still think this is a terrible fold. Berkey is way better than I am at poker but PRETTY sure he gonna be getting a Doug Polk youtube video made out of this because it seems particularly bad.

Sorry about my shitty scribbling, I don't have a stylus  but I tried to draw a white marble little tray sort of thing, maybe a nice looking diffuser that will match whatever else you have in the room nicely and shop for planters you like for the space before you get a plant so you can base what you'd pick around the piece! Also zero clue on what sort of art would fit the rest of the room or your taste so just added what could be a nice layout. I think two large vertical pieces in nice frames would look great too though..
