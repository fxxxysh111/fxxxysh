You know how every "intro to emacs" tutorial or blog post starts off recommending to go through the built in emacs tutorial?

The sub is what it is. When I first came on as mod I was passionate about making this a welcome place for everyone and particularly more welcoming for Koreans than it had been, but over time I realized this wasn possible to enforce in an even remotely consistent fashion. I think we done better than before by stating the rules and enforcing them as objectively as we can. Again not perfectly, as long as humans are involved in moderation it can never be truly objective, but we have have a doubt or question we discuss amongst ourselves and try to come an agreement, which is what happened here. I know there are a lot of complaints about the sub, but again I think that more due to the person making the complaints mindset. People talk about problems on this subreddit as if they super unique: having nationalists, being so negative, being too liberal, being too conservative, etc, but after being on reddit for a long time and reading many, many subreddits, I think /r/korea is pretty average.

1.) Video Poker   Assume we are playing Jacks or Better and the payout schedule will give us a return of 99.5%. This is based on getting a royal flush a certain percentage of hands, a full house another percentage, and so on. For the long term, we naturally think that we will lose 50 cents for every $100 we put through the machine. But this would be true only if the long term meant playing an infinite number of hands. In reality, we never play an infinite number of hands and our luck will determine what side of 99.5% we will fall. For example, if we are lucky and get more than our share of royal flushes and other high payouts, our return will be greater than 100% and we will make money. But if we get less than our share, our return will be much lower than the 99.5% average and we will lose a lot more than 50 cents for every $100 we bet.

What's crazy is we the people have the power to stop this, but for some reason we fail at utilizing it.

Care that causes early engagement of both the patient and clinician coupled with shared accountability for the outcome is the most desirable of relationships.

The supplementation is helpful for fibromyalgia patients suffering from low vitamin D levels, say researchers in the journal PAIN.In addition to pain and fatigue, individuals diagnosed with FMS may experience sleep disorders, morning stiffness, poor concentration, and occasionally mild to severe mental symptoms such as anxiety or depression.The condition can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life, resulting in loss of employment and/or withdrawal from social life.There is no cure, and no treatment will address all of the symptoms, but some symptoms may be alleviated by physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, temporary drug therapy (such as amitriptyline, duloxetine, or pregabaline) and multimodal therapies.Calcifediol is a prehormone produced in the liver by the enzyme cholecalciferol (vitamin D3).Calcifediol is then converted to calcitriol (1,25 (OH)2D3), which is the active form of vitamin D. The concentration of calcifediol in blood is considered the best indicator of vitamin D status.Researchers hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation would reduce the degree of chronic pain experienced by FMS patients with low levels of calcifediol and also might improve other symptoms."Low blood levels of calcifediol are especially common in patients with severe pain and fibromyalgia."We therefore set out to determine whether raising the calcifediol levels in these patients would alleviate pain and cause a general improvement in concomitant disorders."In a randomized controlled trial, 30 women with FMS with low serum calcifediol levels (below 32ng/ml) were randomized to a treatment or control group.The goal for the treatment group was to achieve serum calcifediol levels between 32 and 48ng/ml for 20 weeks via oral cholecalciferol supplements.Serum calcifediol levels were reevaluated after five and 13 weeks, and the dose was reviewed based on the results. The calcifediol levels were measured again 25 weeks after the start of the supplementation, at which time treatment was discontinued, and after a further 24 weeks without supplementation.Twenty four weeks after supplementation was stopped, a marked reduction in the level of perceived pain occurred in the treatment group.Between the first and the 25th week on supplementation, the treatment group improved significantly on a scale of physical role functioning, while the placebo group remained unchanged.The treatment group also scored significantly better on a Fibromalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) on the question of "morning fatigue." However, there were no significant alterations in depression or anxiety symptoms."We believe that the data presented in the present study are promising.

Face the music To confront stoically the consequences of one deeds; to face up to an unpleasant or trying experience. This expression may have originated in the theater, where actors and actresses nervously awaited their cues to come onstage and thus the music in the pit. Another origin may lie in the military practice of mustering soldiers in full battle regalia for inspection, often at the call of a bugle.

I'm talking about the brightly lit, secured, members only poker rooms or social clubs or card houses or however they're branded all across Texas. The kind of places where you have to be a monthly member to play. Where the house doesn't take a cut of the pot.

This would make healthcare insanely expensive if america switches to a single payer system and the US could very well regulate the cost of healthcare but healthcare interest groups would lobby to keep the profit margins so a universal healthcare system would stay extremely expensive. Healthcare costs are also driven higher because the American populace is very unhealthy and the cost to take care of everyone would be astronomical. The health insurance industry is also now too big to take down.

Though not advertised, or affiliated with our "typical" massage program, we were all more than aware that a one offered "extended additional services". And yes, people paid a pretty penny for discretion. And there were more than a few times an unwitting partner or spouse "arranged" a "de lux deep tissue with extended additional services".

Many of the new detectors on the market have exceptional technology that allows you to discriminate and bypass objects like foil, brass and rusty nails. Just remember, the more you discriminate, the less depth you are going to have and one can easily miss a small nugget or coin. It is best to dig every signal until you thoroughly understand and recognize all the signals your detector emits and have the experience to wisely decide when not to dig a particular target.

Try sucking the whole clitoris, taking long licks with the whole of your tongue.

There are many more elements worth considering. Within a few months, the British 14th Army had gone from fighting in jungles to mechanized, combined arms warfare, to urban warfare. Just the idea of combined arms warfare in the Pacific theatre might seem like a strange concept to those familiar with the island hopping campaigns, but in depth study of the Burma campaign 1945 truly shows a serious understanding of modern conventional warfare as it was in the mid 1940s. In terms of deception, which involved everything from attaching the 19th Division that belonged to 4 Corps to 33 Corps to hide the 4 Corps, to fake radio traffic and superiority in the air to prevent Japanese reconnaissance planes from seeing them, it was truly an imaginative strategy that truly has been overlooked. Lastly, and this is always important when talking about military campaigns, Slim could count on the great logistic abilities of his quartermasters and engineers who were able to build airfields on the move so as to supply these two large corps while they marched towards the Irrawaddy. The corps were predominantly supplied either from the air or from the rivers, with improvised rafts and repaired boats serving as vessels to carry supplies.

By that I don mean seedy things, but instead layers that are there for each of the city many different cultures and communities and generations. Pealing back and discovering those layers can take years, and even locals are often only aware of a fraction of what under the city cultural surface. There are metaphorical enclaves within enclaves within enclaves, and most of the cities inhabitants only know of the handful that their own lives pass through, unaware that the rest exists.

Relatively few airlines have placed orders for the very expensive Airbus A380, and aside from Emirates, who by far and away have the largest fleet of A380s anywhere in the sky, most airlines are taking things very steady with this aircraft, as the size of it means that airlines will be expected to carry up to 500 passengers per flight in order to cover costs, and in this economic atmosphere, there are very few routes on which this is now possible. Thai Airways and Malaysia Airlines in particular have big problems utilising their A380s properly, and it could be argued that neither actually need all 6, as 3 foreach of them would be sufficient (for their ultra longhaul flights to Paris and London respectively).

Aggro here. I play aggressively and I usually the most aggressive person at the table. Other regs start losing their shit when I sit down at the table. Oh no, here comes that crazy Russian guy. Psychologically, I already winning before I play a hand because I know they are all "waiting for a hand" to beat me, I can take advantage. Of course I don have it, but all of the dead money at the table is mine. But at the same time, I will have it just as often as you would. Of course I lose like everyone, but I make it tough to beat me because I will bluff you out of pots and when you finally wake up with a hand, I may suck out or have a better hand and then you go on tilt. You finally get AA and are going to show me who boss and I flop a set of 22 and stack you and then you tilt some more. Easy for me to play against you, hard for you to play against me.
Sometimes the entire first season or two is just building up the plot before it gets better. 
I also have personal confirmation of his lies, as a /r/worldnews mod Greenwald has repeatedly attacked the subreddit for not bending on opinion/analysis submissions, which is understandably frustrating for a "journalist" who specializes in analysis and who fans are concentrated on reddit.

I don really have a problem with him specifically, but rather the romance plot. I just noted him specifically since it was mentioned above that he was likely to die. But, also, I just feel like they made him just a "love story character," rather than an actual person. He takes orders, stares intensely, and says cringy romantic lines to Missandei. The love story wasn really developed well, so I have no attachment to their alleged attraction to one another. It a very shallow relationship that feels out of place in a show where up until a season or two ago, relationship (romantic or otherwise) were well developed and well understood.

My comrades in the poker community have referred to April 8 as Friday, and I couldn agree more. This is nothing more than a blatant attack on Internet poker and the American poker player.

"Sie kommen zu mir, weil Sie einen Gesundheitscheck mchten, Helen?"."J   Ja", antwortete sie, etwas zgerlich. Er schaute sie an, direkt in die Augen: "Und sie mchten, dass wir diesen Check ganz genau durchfhren, wirklich alle Organe, alle Krperstellen genau untersuchen?", fragte er weiter. Helen schwieg. Wollte sie das? Wollte sie wirklich, dass dieser "Doktor" sie ganz nackt sehen wrde, dass er ihre intimsten Stellen nicht nur ansehen, auch berhren und noch viel mehr damit machen wrde? Sie rusperte sich, um Zeit zu gewinnen.

It came up in conversation with her when she was telling me all about how people choose the lives they born into when they leave their old lives, unless they have unfinished business or people they have to stick around and help. She was specifically using this to justify not feeling bad about things like homeless mentally ill people (there was a homeless problem in her city), because the life they living is meant to teach their soul something for the next life. 
Should they fall short then the summer trading will take on a life of its own. Much like it did at the end of last season, when James Maddison's knee injury at Hillsborough must have sent palpitations through the Norwich boardroom.

Here comes the sequel to the smash hit "Insidious." The first film, with a production budget just below $2 million, ended up grossing more than $50 million.

When I saw your post yesterday and read the title, my heart sank. I misinterpreted it and assumed it had gone negatively for you. I am so happy to hear that you have the support of your husband and even happier to hear that while this was not your plan, that you are happy with your current path.

And now on to the sixth and final division. The back consists of the upper back, the middle back, and the lower back. Let's not ignore the butt   that is where the most powerful muscles of the body   the upper leg muscles   connect to the main pelvic bone. 
That is a full immersion scenario of course, but it exemplifies how fluid children are at this age. Your child has plenty of time to relearn from her native Spanish speaking father, and it shouldn't be painful or challenging for her at all. Stick to 1P1L, and maybe supplement with some shows, movies, or music. 
A social media platform on a blockchain, where users get rewarded for their time, attention, contribution and content, instead of being bombarded with ads and having their reach reduced, is a strong alternative in my mind.. 
But I have reason to think that unlike the Bushies, they don't really believe it; it's just politics. But too many commentators on the left and the right have accepted the ridiculous idea that the Obama administration is actually socialist. Time to do our homework and show that the Emporer New Clothes may just be the same ol neoliberal con job of making the rich richer gussied up as populist policy.What if the result of all this consolidation of financial power in the hands of a few is that the rich get richer? There is no guarantee that the economic collapse is going to result in a redistribution of wealth, despite the screams of socialism coming from Fox News commentators.In fact, some experts are suggesting that what is really going on is that class interests are being protected by Secretary Geithner and his gang.

The centrepiece of Canada's innovation strategy is the $950 million "supercluster" initiative. The goal, according to the federal government, is for companies of all sizes, academia and the non profit sector to collaborate on new technologies, to spur economic growth and create jobs.

"We may have to work some extra hours, but we should be fine."Environment and Climate Change Canada said in a statement Tuesday that the relocation will allow the nest to remain   and the eggs to hatch   in a natural environment.The bird and its eggs   both of which enjoy protected status in Canada   were nestled on a cobblestone patch that would normally be directly underneath the main Bluesfest stage.Workers came across the killdeer last week when they arrived at the festival venue, which is being set up for a July 5 start date.What the workers described was an agitated bird   the usual defensive habits of an adult killdeer when a threat or intruder has come too close to its nest.Organizers put up yellow caution tape in place around the nest site, and the National Capital Commission paid for 24 hour security on ground overseen by the federal agency.Eggs generally take between 24 and 26 days to hatch, and it is unusual for them not to hatch by mid June. 
For this reason alone, I'm hoping that sit/stand desks one day hit the mainstream, with mass market furniture companies making many low priced versions. 
There are two main reasons for this:1) In poker, people fold early, and the more people that are at the table the more likely you should fold, so in practice most hands become 2 player pretty quickly.2) In poker, there is basically no opportunity to collaborate. You can team up with one player to take down another player. Trying this would be collusion and it would be against the rules.For these reasons, people that I have spoken to who develop poker AIs as training tools (or as "training tools") tell me that these techniques all work well in 6max too, and that for basically every popular poker variant that is played online there are now superhuman AIs.In 3+ player games, Nash equilibrium only guarantees that you cannot do better by unilaterally deviating to a different strategy.

Consumer capitalism is all about selling us products we don need by convincing us we need them. Today I resisted buying a plastic onion meant to hold a real onion, a cell phone holder for my bicycle and a $300 pair of shoes (and I wasn even shopping).

If those symptoms increase over time and interfere with a person's daily life, that person should seek professional help, she said. Everyone experiences such symptoms differently but Kamkar stressed that people should know that these feelings are normal.

Usually, it a slam dunk. 
In my opinion, Salman seems now to be on his way out as titular leader of the Arab/Persian/Muslim world. But the public memory is notoriously fickle, and his continuing moderate stances on women's rights and attempts to otherwise modernize a continent stuck in 16th century social, political and business habits could soon give him renewed traction.

This step is a vital one which many of the agen poker terpercaya setters are actually unaware of. Many work unconsciously with the goals regularly. It certainly a good idea to take the approach consciously. You can have a notebook where you can develop your statement of achievement. You should write your own statement and the goals list twice everyday.
It more regularly shows up in women with higher natural skin pigment, but it can also show up in people who aren't pregnant   particularly in adolescents during puberty. 
Last night, Obama spoke at the HRC fundraising gala and currently the HRC website declares, President Obama underlines his unwavering support for LGBT Americans. The vast amount of organizing resources the HRC wastes on their false alliance with the Democratic party leaves radical queers on the margins to fend for themselves. Our struggle has always had to resist the repression of conservative tendencies in government and society to gain liberation in our lives..

The notion that anyone knows best has been proven wrong throughout human history. Everyone makes mistakes, and yes, many of these mistakes are stupid and foreseeable in 20/20 hindsight. The goal is to have a system that can punish mistake makers and to keep power in check through competition and diverse management systems.

340 is being kind of neglected by both myself and my project partner. It's a fairly straight forward class; the workload is manageable, which is nice. Our instructor seems really invested in making the course better, and we have regular surveys to take to give feedback on the course. The videos are all from Wolford and are pretty useless. It's unfortunate, cause he seems really knowledgeable, it just doesn't translate into him being a good instructor.
The major issue is that I am looking for a program with low strength component   I am trying to avoid high strength sets in the near future   which means that I don think PHUL or 5/3/1 (with size elements) based programs will serve me well, I thought about running GVT.

Note I am pro choice and I believe humans own their body: the State cannot force a woman to harbor a foetus in her womb, as it cannot forcefully inject anything into her circulatory system. Abortion should not be illegal, however dramatic it is when it is practiced. 
That said, what most people do is get cheaper paint, cheaper rollers, and cheaper brushes. I understand the desire to save money, but in the end, you end up with less quality, a lot of aggravation, and possibly spending more money than you would have.
So, I pretty new to DMing and D in general. I was raised in an extremely religious family and was forbidden from even thinking about stuff like this. so about a year ago (July last year), a friend approached me and, long story short, I ended up DMing for a group of friends. None of us had ever played before or had any real, long term experience with D except one member of the group. who had been playing for several years and had also been a DM herself.

The Boulder District Attorney's Office has also filed two crime of violence sentencing enhancements in the case.Prosecutors allege that Collins struck 71 year old Katie Kulpa in the head with a fire poker at her Lefthand Canyon residence in September, fracturing her skull and nearly killing her.Prosecutors also allege that Collins who had open charges from an unrelated incident at the time of the alleged attack cut off his ankle monitor when he fled and altered his appearance to avoid capture.However, testimony revealed that Collins suffered a chaotic childhood, which resulted in stunted emotional development and left him less mature than the average 16 year old.Collins also reportedly suffers from multiple mental health and substance abuse issues that have been left largely untreated.

The door pop allows the handler officer to remotely unlatch the door so the K9 may exit the squad car and come to their aid. The heat alarm system monitors the interior air temperature of the squad car and sets off the sirens, lights, alarms and rolls down the windows of the car to ensure that a K9 doesn't suffer from heat trauma if the temperature rises into a dangerous threshold.

For now, her other hand can rest wherever it is most comfortable for her. Now, with your left hand, hold the client's same hand, finger through finger (intertwined). Then switch hands, and repeat the process, working with both of your hands on one of her hands each time.

I think it fantastic that you don have the urge to objectify a woman that you saw walking in the street. Place that tremendous amount of sexual energy into an investment with great returns, such as your studies; or, if your musically incline, place that energy into becoming a proficient musician. The grades will increase your chances of pursuing any career that you desire, be that medicine or art, and being able to play an instrument will enrich you for the rest of your life.

My husband is very alpha, very driven, and, as we are Christian, is very serious about his responsibility as the head of our home.

This is to prevent people from having the agent market the property and work with buyers only to have the buyer wait for the contract to expire and cut the agent out of the deal, saving the commission costs. For context, in my area, it is common to ask for a 1 year listing and a 6 month holdover even though the average days on market is less than 60 for residential properties.. 
It just basically a poll of its citizens on how the citizens of each country, and their view of their government record on corruption.

The legislature has made signature gathering on petitions harder. Several marijuana legalization signatures are circulating. But with time growing short for the November ballot   signatures must be submitted in July   only a paid canvassing campaign likely would be able to start this late and still qualify. And even paid campaigns sometimes fall short because of rules that lead to disqualification of signatures. The Friday Law Firm, which represents Oaklawn Park, is something of an expert on ballot measures and you can expect them to be on top of the action, if further develops.
