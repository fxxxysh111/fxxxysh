While Eastern style honesty might not have been a hallmark of Deadwood when it was set up as a rogue mining camp in the Dakota territory during the 1800s, integrity and frankness have become hallmarks at a museum, which should be the starting point for tourists who truly want to appreciate Deadwood and its colourful, controversial history.
Norway is known for being a pretty progressive nation. Now the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) is launching a new program in the fall that will further cement the country's open minded reputation.

Op deze dinsdag was het eindelijk zo ver: we vertrokken weer naar Noord Amerika, voor onze ondertussen al weer 6de road trip daar! De avond er voor had papa ons al naar Diegem vlakbij de luchthaven gebracht, waar we overnachtten in de Ibis budget (blijkbaar het vroegere Etap). Een dikke tegenvaller, heel kleine kamer en veel te basic voor ons. We doodden de avond daar nog met een geocache in de buurt en een theetje in het eigenlijke Ibis hotel (heel wat opschudding daar toen de Amerikanen het nieuws over de bomaanslagen in Boston zagen). Om 10u gaan slapen, want we namen de shuttle ochtends al om 7u. Inchecken ging heel vlot zonder wachtrij en dankzij mijn Aldi kofferweegschaal waren beide valiezen perfect op gewicht! Goede investering dus. Na het traditionele ontbijtje op de luchthaven steeg onze vlucht met United Airlines om 10u op.

The big real life coincidence? The Zorians were going to demonstrate the weapon in the "Shiprock Desert", north of Gallup, New Mexico, which means I guess they planned to use the thing on land in the Navajo Nation. It so happens that the Trinity Site (of the plutonium implosion explosion) is only 100 miles or east of the Gallup area and the beautiful Shiprock. to experiment with a weapon like this, so choosing a location so close to the one that was used for an actual atomic explosion is pretty interesting. It doesn mean anything, of course, but it does have a certain amusement value. then there some fabulousness, like this:

Be skeptical please, I sure there are some comfortable gaming chairs, and the H chairs I owned before broke after the warranty expired; my previous Aeron chair (bought in the late 1990 lasted about 12 years. which is coincidentally the same amount as their warranty. But compared to most cheaper executive office chairs, or gaming chairs (which are the same thing, just different styling), I say the Embody or Aeron are sufficiently more expensive to make it a mixed bag, you can afford to replace several gaming chairs with the cost of one Embody, so one could theoretically replace them as soon as the cushion collapses, as they always do after about 18 months.

Hell, even if you just check called it would probably be for way less than all in so you wouldn have lost nearly as much.So basically jamming river is a huge mistake, leading pot on the flop is an ever huger one because it messed up the rest of the hand.

Use visual examples and stories to explain new concepts. When teaching math to young children, it is a good idea to use very visual examples.

There are 2 main muscles in the calf that point your toe and help you "spring off" when you walk or run. The gastroc is the big showy muscle, and is stretched best when your knee is straight. The soleus is under the gastroc, and is the more powerful muscle. Since the soleus doe not cross the knee joint, it is stretched most effectively when the knee is bent to slacken the gastroc. so stretch both ways!

The sad thing is, Biden a smart guy and the Times readers are smart enough to engage in a real discussion and even defense of the Obama administration chosen path to economic recovery.

If Biden disagrees with economists as respected as Krugman, then let him do so.

It that he like to be able to rent it out at a fair price, I interpreted that as meaning less than market, presumably because it nice to have tenants who live on your property with you, appreciate you for being fair to them and not gouging them. Also, tenants who pay less than market stick around longer and so you don lose money/energy to turnover. Remember, this guy is not a property manager/absentee landlord. Finding new tenants detracts from his personal time outside his day job.
A question arises: is it too risky to hunter in Poker. Will not you lose more? Will not rake swallow all profits? Here of course much depends on the level of the player. However, at low limits up to $1/$2 (it is no use to trying higher for a hunter and the bank does not allow to risk in this way) the level of the players is not too high, therefore anybody who will spend a couple of hours on studying the chance concept and basic principles of the game and print the table of the start hands, has good chance to become a plus player. Of course some negative losses are possible but in on line casinos the situation is the same therefore Poker rooms is more kindly soil for the hunting. And while acquiring playing experience a casino bonus hunter may well transfer to the class of professional casino players and start earning tens and even hundreds of dollars per hour WITHOUT BONUSES.

"The clubs did respond to the policy shocks and it depended on their financial capacity on how they could respond," he said. 
Reductive? Maybe, but the desire to imitate those people with the most status is a nearly universal impulse. Anthropologists call it prestigious imitation. Now think about how radically prestige changed with the birth of photography. Previously we might have looked to our parents or older siblings, village elders, or even the Queen as the most prestigious and therefore worthy of imitation, but with the invention of cinema and the creation of movie stars, all that changed. Early on in the cinematic era, anthropologist Marcel Maus, understood we were starting to shape our very bodies in an effort to imitate matinee idols. Writing in 1934, Maus had a "revelation" while lying in a hospital bed in New York.

Boardwalks, nesting boxes for ducks and other birds, bat boxes, osprey nesting platforms, local wildflower species, observation decks, figuring out what lived there and providing little "about the wildlife" boards, whatever it took.Nature doesn't concern itself to being confined to "properties." Before too long, the local wildlife would comfortably spread into my neighbor's land, especially with that pond, and it's highly likely a few threatened or even endangered species (frog, duck, turtle, etc) would spread there with some encouragement, besides deer, raccoons, and similar "pesky" friends.Confine my property into being protected?

Mark Schauss brought together some of the brightest minds working to prevent chronic inflammation. Common themes that were repeatedly presented by multiple experts are worth sharing. Here are ten insights into this silent killer:1) Most of the diseases that affect us in the 21st century are completely reversible with diet and lifestyle change.2) The five essential supplements for fighting chronic inflammation are:Get at least half of your fat intake from omega 3 fish oils because they are anti inflammatory and support the production of enzymes that are involved in the detoxification process.Maintain your vitamin D at 50 ng/ml year round because it is involved in p53 gene function, which checks for errors when a cell replicates, fixing or killing it so as to prevent cancer.For magnesium, this is partly because the soil is no longer rich in magnesium, making dietary sources of magnesium nearly unavailable.Processed foods rarely contain magnesium, and cheap magnesium supplements like magnesium oxide are not absorbable by the body.Additionally, phthalates (toxins found in personal care products among other things) have a chelating effect on zinc and magnesium.

The sad thing is, Biden a smart guy and the Times readers are smart enough to engage in a real discussion and even defense of the Obama administration chosen path to economic recovery.

If Biden disagrees with economists as respected as Krugman, then let him do so. That what Times readers deserve. Not political pablum served up with a side of propaganda.

Bush's plain talk is often bracing. over Iraq's intransigence is a good thing; it is what Bill Clinton should have done when Saddam Hussein thwarted inspections in 1998. And in the short run, Bush will have his way in Iraq, certainly; rolling up al Qaeda, probably; perhaps with Turkey and at the Security Council as well. But he has been extremely careless in the process, and there are bound to be consequences. The consequences in postwar Iraq are unknowable. The consequences in North Korea the production and sale of plutonium, or a military effort to thwart such sales could be cataclysmic. The transatlantic consequences may become more apparent after the war is over: the French, no doubt, have enjoyed their leading role in the current melodrama and may seek to make it permanent. They may attempt to organize a new alliance a loose one, no doubt to thwart American power. The portents are clear: it will be harder and harder for America to have its way, diplomatically, in the world.

"So you are to have THAT, too," she said in a choked voice. And without another word she had turned and gone across the fields homeward. Anne was deeply hurt; for the moment she felt as if she could never like Leslie again. But when Leslie came over a few evenings later she was so pleasant, so friendly, so frank, and witty, and winsome, that Anne was charmed into forgiveness and forgetfulness. Only, she never mentioned her darling hope to Leslie again; nor did Leslie ever refer to it. But one evening, when late winter was listening for the word of spring, she came over to the little house for a twilight chat; and when she went away she left a small, white box on the table. Anne found it after she was gone and opened it wonderingly. In it was a tiny white dress of exquisite workmanship  delicate embroidery, wonderful tucking, sheer loveliness. Every stitch in it was handwork; and the little frills of lace at neck and sleeves were of real Valenciennes. Lying on it was a card "with Leslie's love."

So Sarah Lynn comment is likely just her filling in the blanks for herself assuming it was something more than the two them taking off their shoes (which if I recall is all that happened). Hell, when you first see her reaction when Bojack says he tried to sleep with the daughter Sarah Lynn looks HORRIFIED, or as much as the characters can in this art style.But in the end, what Bojack did with Penny even though nothing happened at the time (he has since said he knows deep down inside he would gone through with it) is that it still morally wrong? He was a family friend, he was Penny friend based off the fact that he totally knew exactly how she want to get back at Diego regarding prom and such.

That doesn mean getting this movie made was easy. An early prospective producer suggested casting a white woman as the lead. Later, the filmmakers turned down a lucrative deal with Netflix to make the film with Warner Bros., which guaranteed it a higher profile release. This mattered, both for fans of Kevin Kwan best selling book series, which inspired the film, and for Asian audiences the world over who have waited decades to see themselves represented onscreen in all their diversity.

The issue is that TRP claims to be morally superior to the women they deal with when they are the male equivalent of those same women.

In my opinion the US (and plenty of other countries, but i live in the us) is only succeeding in providing some negative liberties (freedom from having your guns taken away, or freedom from government action over your speech, OG john locke type stuff) than creating any positive liberty (Security of any kind that would allow people to do what they want).
