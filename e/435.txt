If Sam Hyde wants to have his cake and eat it too, wants to have his opinions be confusing and nebulous and also wants to contribute to groups he disagrees with, that his right. He can do that. But the only thing I definitely know about him is that he made that donation and I don have to spend another second pondering or considering every possible nuance of his decision to know that I disagree with it. If he was trying to make a point, there were tons of other and better ways to do so. If he just made a mistake, fine. But the position and mindset he was in when he did the shitty thing that he did in no way absolves him of that shitty thing.

America's history of slavery and white people using the word as a derogatory term make it a bit upsetting. The reason black people in general don't want white people saying it is because of its history and that there are still many white people who use it as an insult today, making it so if another white person says it no matter how comfortable you are with them you can't help but question the intention. Whereas when another black person says it, we're both black and can't really insult each other with it making it more synonymous to the word brotha for us.

The planet is going to warm for centuries if we stopped ALL emissions today. Biodiversity is plumetting. 58% of wildlife has died since 1970, largely due to fragmentation (simply inhabiting the land). There almost no wilderness left, and it will take thousands of years for biodiversity to repair. No amount of conservation or technology is going to be a magic solution to these problems. They were not caused by consumption alone.

This dream could be important and trying to tell you something, so do something about it. Tell someone. If it's something like World War III or some other horrible thing, you should tell the Fox 5 News. This may sound really silly, but you should. There were some people who had dreams the night before 9/11 about what happened, and they didn't realize it would happen the next day and lots of innocent people died. So if you want to save kind people, tell someone.

That night the guys took us out again (at this point we feel like mail order brides or something) but they know all the best restaurants and we had coffee at a caf overlooking the Bosphorous and they were just really generous and friendly. Mustafa is obsessed with Wendi so he gave us his mobile phone to use for the month while he goes to Holland. Also, he organized a rental car for us for $10 a day through a friend of his.

Having employees give off the attitude that they don't want to be there or that the customer is an inconvenience is my number one deal breaker.

Get another $100 out and try again. Next time try to utilize some sort of safety net (I will stop playing when I lose this buy in, etc.) Sounds like you were massively tilted. In your head it was probably because the $1900 wasn real, it was all profit from the first $100. Also, if you ran up $100 $1900 I assume you weren playing .05/.10 or even .10/.25, where you really should have been playing, if not lower with a $100 bankroll. Try using the 10% rule, never put more than 10% of your "poker money" on one table at one time. Even lower for tournaments, try not to buy in for more than 3%. As your roll decreases, your buy ins decrease. Really dedicate yourself to beating lower limits, then moving up and seeing how games are different. Study, practice, track and learn. That ride up to $1900 was fun as shit probably, but it wasn built on solid poker fundamentals. If you want to treat poker as gambling, keep reloading that benjy and trying to make a score.

Secondhand kids stores, Goodwill, and Salvation Army are goldmines for barely used baby stuff, and given your age and situation they'd probably cut you a huge discount if not give you some items for free.

That is the true cause of most heart attacks, NOT LDL cholesterol.

The thing I never liked about it was that it was all about building a business. It was opportunism. In the months prior to the beginning of it, the guy running the thing was trying hard to get people to pay attention to his let plays to no avail (he still has posts on his account where he was ignoring subreddit rules to post advertisements for his let play channel).

He keeps trolling new ideas in the hope of uncovering one or more "hidden jewels.". 
At the beginning of the manga I can honestly say that it was a bit confusing as it lacked a very small explanation to get it through my head, though it was only for the very first pages and not like those manga that tend to not explain nothing at all in certain cases until a few chapters later. I appreciated that and it made it feel a bit more lively as it explained after a few more pages. 
I like that he sticks to his guns and doesn shy away from the leftist bullying attempts that come his way. 
I dated a guy long distance (for most of our relationship) for almost 3 years, and he did not understand my anxiety at all. Called me crazy, ignored my calls/texts, frequently went out drinking and got in some bad situations, which only sparked my anxiety even more.

So I slightly mis remembered the current R vs. D split in the Senate, thinking it was 52v48, but currently it 53v45 +2 Ind that caucus with Dem. From the OP post I was assuming that they meant that the vote would be 52 no and 48 yes, meaning the resolution would not pass and therefore not be sent to POTUS, ie, not be vetoed.. 
Fry must be counted among the most fully developed and representative Englishmen of his period; and the question arises whether, had fortune allowed him to concentrate on the things of the mind, not distracted by the lure of cricket, a lure intensified by his increasing mastery over the game, he would not have reached a high altitude in politics or critical literature.

There are even jumbo playing cards made especially for children. The Farmer in the Dell playing cards features all the characters from the song and comes in a 3.5 X5 inch playing card perfect for little hands to hold. 
While they were grateful about the pricing, it was the fact that the Metal 12 Row Casino Table Chip Tray with Cover and Lock came with a lock and key. I actually bought it because of the size, but it did make sense that they wanted to keep everything safe just in case something were to happen. In the end, it became one of the pieces of the puzzle that volunteers needed to make sure they did while using the poker chips.. 
I disagree, a lot of plays in RL only work because of bad positioning and rotation that is difficult to spot. A lot of the time people would point the finger at the wrong person, for example it can be an attacker making a slow rotation that ends up making the defender miss the save.
Another one I recall, dont ask me from where and what time, would be having your legs and arms amputated at the hips and shoulders. The wounds cauterized so you didnt bleed to death, and then having your eyes removed.

River is an easy check/fold, turning your hand into a bluff here makes no sense on this river.. 
Yes of course they want to join in. After all it looks so easy when the professionals raise all in with a Jack high and steal the pot on a complete bluff against two pairs. What they don't realise is that it takes years of practise to develop the instinct to know when they can bluff like that. 
It seems the least I can do to respect the language that the vast majority of Quebecois consider their native tongue (although maybe with how I speak French it more disrespect than respect?)..

Following the Beach Hotel decision to remove poker machines from their venue, Cr Paul Spooner wants to encourage other venues in the Shire to follow suit.
I've found Poker Room to be quite excellent (and Java based, useful for OS X users since most of the other sites I've seen require a Windows download), and the level of play won't kill you if you're just starting out. There's always some open tables, and you can always get more play money. I had AskedMeFi recently about any standalone poker games for OS X and was tipped off to pokerroom; it's certainly better than anything I could download (because apparently the AI available on the different Mac games sucks, whereas the real people you play with are much more reasonably irrational).. 
That all; religious freedom is only peripherally involved in a case where they accept money to do something, then do their best to treat certain cases as "separate but equal" or something along those lines.

I paid half the bills, maintained our home (and did a dandy job), reared 2 lovely babies, so he could work crazy hours (I talking like 12 20 hr days depending on the season), under the conditions of "I want a better life for them." Well, yes me too, but dollar for dollar, I pay half, while he made more. If I ran low on money to get to from work, I would ask him to borrow, because he always had it.

Ironically, the nerve block i had been given ended up making my leg mostly numb for nearly 3 weeks, without drugs the most I felt was pressure and an annoying sensation like the tingles you get when your leg is asleep.

In 1732, aromatic waters were further refined into cologne when Giovanni Maria Farina of Cologne, France, took over his uncle's business. Aqua Admirabilis, a lively blend of neroli, bergamot, lavender, and rosemary in grape alcohol, which has a distinct fruity scent, was used on the face and also treated sore gums and indigestion. Soldiers dubbed it "Eau de Cologne," meaning Cologne water, after the town, and the name cologne stuck to all perfumed waters since then. 
There was once a group of wizards and alchemists that wanted to make a smarter monster to use them as servants and slaves. They experimented on many creatures and were able to make a lot of them smart. But the plan backfired since one of the monsters read the wizards mind and they formed rebellion. They killed the wizards and escaped to nearest mountains.

However, breaking down a cohesive strategy   such as donking and defending against various forms   that took me a lot of time to learn and understand for someone whom I don know is not appealing.

I am a new immigrant to Canada from the USA. It a lot like starting from scratch. And it also the new year. So many things I want to accomplish but the biggest one for me, aside from learning to speak French, is writing every dang day. I feel as if I be able to do the other stuff that I want to do/get done like working out more (ie walking the dog more), or finishing up work projects, once I nail the writing thing. One page a day. I have a degree in fiction. I haven done much with it. My chops are rusty. I have ideas of stories that come to me all the time. I write down ideas in my go to notebook. But I haven been good at all with just starting a flow, which means starting with just one page. And then seeing what happens from there.
Sorry, I haven been able to reddit much the last few days. But, here some of my thoughts for new GMs.
We understand some of the reservations about Hillary Clinton. That she violated arcane government email protocols, a tempest in a tiny teapot if there ever was one, is no reason to vote against her. But the chain of donors and employees running through government to the Clinton foundation and back again should concern you   as it points out how Washington, on both sides of the aisle, is rotten with the whiff of money and influence peddling..

None of that includes western acts who are touring around the same time like Ariana Grande who, for example, was the reason I didn't try to get Red Velvet tickets because I had just bought tickets for her tour. Withholding releases and taking forever for groups to come back) is only effective to a certain degree because fans are just desperate for pretty much any new content that they'll eat it right up (although that mostly applies to Blackpink so I'm not sure if it's the same with his other groups?)

One of the primary benefits of a sports massage is that it boosts blood circulation in areas near the skin that may not get as much circulation normally. Working a muscle will momentarily push blood out of an area, and then allow blood to rush back in with fresh nutrients like oxygen. You can see this process at work: When you put pressure on skin, it pales as blood rushes out, while releasing pressure makes it redden as blood rushes back.

In the typical trope of the romance novel, the book New Moon portrays just an ordinary gal, Bella Swan  Kristen Stewart  who is not particularly beautiful (well, she is, but she not supposed to be), not particularly smart, and ALWAYS in need of protection from her preternaturally strong men  the vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob with his abs. The lead romantic male must be strong, but emotionally distant (Edward is so emotionless he always looks slightly constipated in these movies). But his love for the heroine cracks his emotional distance and brings him to her (and only her).

Beyond that, the most basic argument for the separation of sex and gender is the existence of trans people itself. Unless your argument is that trans people should not be accepted, that their identities are invalid, and that their symptoms are all purely due to mental illness, you have to acknowledge that sex and gender can be different. (Or you could argue biological sex is mutable/a matter of identity, which would be a really interesting viewpoint to take!) If you don acknowledge that, any claim of trans acceptance you have boils down to I think they faking it and they mentally ill, but I don want to be an open bigot or doublethink..

That tailender Bill Johnston topped Australia's batting averages on their 1953 Ashes tour owed a little to a sense of fun in his own skipper and his opponents. Johnston, who never made a first class fifty, was on a tour aggregate of 70 runs for only once out when his captain Lindsay Hassett realised the possibility of a bizarre stat, thereafter sending his bowler out to bat with a note asking the opposing team to play along and avoid dismissing him.

I personally subscribe to the descriptivistic view of language where the "rules" we write are our tools to describe language as it actually happens, but the people writing the rules don have any influence over the way the language is actually spoken (just look at the countries/organization that do try to control the language, such as France and see how much effect they have on the day to day speech of its inhabitants).

Regarding the ammonia / nitrite / nitrate levels, a thriving plant should work to reduce your overall nitrate levels (although I have heard there is a heavy preference for ammonia), while a dying plant or even just dead leaves will increase ammonia levels, which of course goes on to produce nitrite then finally increase nitrate levels through the nitrogen cycle.

Cats may have begun their domestication due to changes in human lifestyle. As nomads turned from hunting to raising their own crops and animals, cats began to prove their usefulness in ridding rodents from grains and became an accepted part of the family.

When reserving a spa day isn't in the wedding budget, set aside a little time to pamper yourself on your own. Yoga is a wonderful way to center your body and relieve anxiety and fatigue. Play soft music and watch a yoga DVD to practice stretching, meditation and breathing techniques in the comfort of your own home. When you're particularly stressed and are in need of a simple indulgence, quickly soak in a warm bath before bed. Add bath salts to the water and choose a pleasing scent that will calm your senses, like lavender or chamomile. Dead Sea salts are especially good for you; add them to a bath to relieve minor aches and pains, soothe skin ailments like acne, dry skin and psoriasis, and prevent wrinkles. While Dead Sea salts can be a little expensive and hard to find, Epsom salt is inexpensive and can be purchased from your local pharmacy or grocery store. The magnesium sulfate found in Epsom salt can reduce inflammation and pain and even detoxify your body.

After two weeks of dealing with KPN, the network provider, and my landlord, it been discovered that the unit is not wired and the network provider will need to drill and wire an internet connection to the apartment with the estimated completion date of mid April.I feel deceived by the landlord for not giving us the correct information about the apartment, but I don know what is in my rights as a tenant to demand prompt internet service.Is it typical to demand of my landlord to reduce the rent during the months for which we won have internet, and use that money to pay for a 4G internet device or unlimited mobile internet? Or is there another route I can take that is considered more reasonable here? I don want to go nuclear within the first two months of living here but I also need an internet connection in my home.

It's a long, grinding game of patience and attrition. And that's because it's all about tediously waiting for the percentages to line up in your favor   successful poker players only play about 20 percent of the hands they're dealt. That's right   80 percent of the time, they're spectators. And, they know exactly what percentage of hands they're playing, because this is the type of minutiae they keep track of.

In fact, many poker pros   especially the online players   are outright stats junkies, entering the details of every single session into analysis programs to calculate their overall win rate and help them fix any holes in their games.
