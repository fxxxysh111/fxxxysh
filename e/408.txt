Caveat to add is that and are ambiguous and fluid terms, and the corollary of this is that there is never a single most moderate position on anything. Following on further from this, we can only really compare the moderate position to absolute extreme stances, and what is really the point of this? After all we all know that the completely free and unfettered market, and the 100% state controlled economy are both undesirable. Obviously our economy should contain a mixture of free market forces and government intervention, and this is the position relative to the 2 extremes, but is there any real pride in taking this position?

Betting Patterns: If you see a betting pattern emerging where the poker bluffer is betting at pots in late position or on the button, that everyone has checked at, then you can guess that they are either extremely lucky or making a lot of plays. This is where you can either check your big hand to them or even double bluff by re raising them signifying a big hand when really all you have is a great read on their bluff.

Due to pot odds and implied odds you basically are getting a free roll for strong nut potential hands that can semi bluff strongly on the flop very profitably.

But even though noticeably large muscles wouldn be any more realistic, women are weaker to the extent that they are smaller. Just like men are. You mention tennis? Men thrash women at tennis. Amateur male soccer teams thrash professional female soccer teams. They can kick the ball farther and run faster, so it not even a matter of skill. A female warrior who could realistically compete with men would be an extreme outlier by our modern culture standards, like Brienne in Game of Thrones. I like her.

The sheer scale of the universe is what leads most to believe there is probably life. Our galaxy has the mass of 100 billion of our suns, but probably has closer to the range of 200 400 billion stars of varying sizes. Solar systems (stars with planets) in our galaxy could be as high as 100 billion as well. The number of galaxies in our observable universe is between (on the lowest end of math using observed galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field image) 176 billion and (far more likely knowing the limits of the instruments) 2 trillion galaxies.

In "real" poker, if the players runs out of money in the middle of a hand and cannot secure credit or a backer to cover a raised wager, they are out of the hand and lose the money they have already placed in the pot. See the movie "Big Hand for a Little Lady" for a comical practical explanation.

Islamabad: should thank your stars that you are not the prime minister in today Pakistan; you can have a moment peace during the day and a restful sleep at night; it is more of a curse than a luxury. said PML (N) whip Sheikh Aftab who is perhaps the most under rated politician in the ruling party. At least half of the government functioning in the Parliament rests on his shoulders and yet he remains a junior minister. He was responding to Javed Hashmi assertion that he had never aspired to become the prime minister. No sooner had Aftab uttered these golden words than walked in Nawaz Sharif, accompanied by a band of his senior ministers who are habitually absent from Parliament when the prime minister is not around. Aftab description of the prime minister life was written large over the face of Nawaz Sharif. Gone were the heady days when he relished his Kashmiri cuisine and could spare time for his music (he once showed journalists Zaffar Abbas, Nusrat Javed, Mohammad Malick and yours truly his collection of music, Geeta Dutt being his favourite). One could notice traces of sleepless nights and troubled days on his face even from the Press Gallery.

Sadly, this is often the case. analyzing each real estate expert evidence in detail, Justice Mesbur determined that she was unable to accept either expert opinion, adding, with some frustration, I recognize the valuation is an art, not a science, I would have expected the ultimate opinions to have been much closer to one another. then went on to parse at length, the differences between each expert, increasing the $14,000,000 value for the Toronto home proffered by one expert and discounting the other expert value of $17,600,000. She determined that the home was valued at $15,500,000 at the date of separation.

Considering the millions of possible hands a player can have in five card poker alone, that is an amazing rate of accuracy! Less confusion: Are you a pro with memory and math skills? If so, you still cannot match the accuracy rate of a good piece of poker odds calculator software. If you are in the majority of folks who find those two areas to be a bit more problematic, then taking advantage of the poker odds calculator is even more advantageous.

In Tripoli, Lebanon, a depressingly complacent 40 year old baker still lives with his mother. He is, with no exaggeration, the epitome of a "mama's boy." His mom cooks for him, cleans for him she even keeps his nights busy by acting as his poker buddy or by making him help her dye her hair. It's apparent that his life is a bit less than thrilling. Yet when his mother uncharacteristically takes a trip out of town, he is forced to finally make an effort to take his place as an adult. The film inter splices its series of long, static takes with documentary style interviews and panning shots of Tripoli, but without obvious reason. Adding to the unease with the film direction, the camera technique is inconsistently unsteady to give a sense of realistic voyeurism or, more believable, as a result of amateur filmmaking. To top it all off, the movie's untrained actors (friends and family of the directors) are unable to sustain their intentions for long. In their efforts to make dialogue seem raw and spontaneous, the actors instead throw out emotionless statements that make it even more painfully obvious how much more direction Attieh and Garcia should have given to polish the film.

I see the logic in the argument. Though one could argue that due to a stagnation of wages, minimum wage has failed to rise with inflation and has actually dropped.

Nataree is one of many soapy massage joints along Ratchadaphisek Road, which is ever so slightly outside the downtown area. The nearest public transport is Huay Khwang subway station. Take exit 3 out of the station and walk in the same direction that you come out of the exit (opposite to the flow of traffic). After about 2 minutes, you will find Nataree on your right, set back from the road. Just after a Thai restaurant, dip in to the little enclave and you will see Nataree. Actually, there are two Nataree joints, but go in the first one (or, when facing them, go into the one on the right). I believe the other one is a standard massage venue. 7/10

I say a lot of my live (and online fwiw) strategy is based on work I done with solvers, but it is still highly exploitative . People using solvers effectively aren using them to follow the equilibrium strat exactly, and the ones that are usually give up as its an overwhelming futile approach. Equilibrium, even pseudo equilibrium that a solver provides, is way too complicated to follow exactly. Despite this, using solvers to craft your strategy is a worthwhile endeavor. As you work more and more in a solver, patterns emerge. You develop an instinctive feel for how you should play and how villain should play given the range v. range interaction. As you start to see how far we deviate from equilibrium, your nodelocking work should help you understand how to best counter your opponents.

Let's say you get a dent in the hood   nothing too drastic, just a shallow, even dent with no sharp creases in an area that's pretty easy to reach. You think it'll be easy to pop it out on your own, so you begin to massage the underside while holding your shaping tool in place. You've made good progress so far, and a casual observer wouldn't even notice the flawed area. But it's not exactly perfect, and since it's been fairly easy to this point, you decide to keep massaging the area to make it flawless. After a few more minutes of massaging, you realize that you've pushed it just a little too far. And now you've got this flabby area on the hood where you stretched out the metal. And there's no easy way to shrink it back down. Keep going and it'll stretch even more. Lesson learned. And it's a pain in the butt. And it's expensive. And I've also made some bad calls in terms of judging what I can handle myself . and what I'd just make worse. That said, I've never bought a product from an infomercial to attempt a car repair.

DRURY, Don Don passed away suddenly, Friday, February 27, 2015, at age 60. Don will be missed by wife, Leesa MacKenzie and stepson, John Paul Esqueda MacKenzie. Don was predeceased by his mother Kathleen and father Gordon. Never an orphan, as he described himself, he has countless "brothers and sisters" from across the globe and certainly in this City of Hamilton   many of whom love him and would call him brother. Will be missed also by Moe Scally (like a sister), Joanna McCallum (like a daughter) and best friends, Doris Konow and Mark Mackesy. Don was a former City Councillor for Ward 3 and a long time employee of the Ministry of Labour, with the Office of the Worker Advisor. Although in many respects private, Don was someone who belonged to the people. He was funny, intelligent, witty, a trickster, a fighter to those in need and a friend to countless individuals; however, he also understood what was going on in the world in a most serious way. Above all, Don was generous. Don loved to travel and to read the New York Times, follow sports, especially his beloved Manchester United   and of course, host his biweekly poker games with cats, Sunny and Gordie, in the bleachers. Don will be especially missed by the Keyholders, a group who had keys to his home and were always welcome. Thinking of others to the end, Don donated his body to the Education Program in Anatomy at McMaster University. A Memorial Service will take place at St. at the Waterfront Banquet Centre, 555 Bay Street North (above the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club). Please bring your favourite Don Drury stories, as he would have it no other way.

If they make a sequel, Silksong or HK3, there are two options: retcon one of the endings to be a true ending, or inject more backstory into the world to weave a believable context around how the Knight both Is and Is Not the new Hollow Knight, how Hornet both Is and Is Not in there with him, how the infection both Does and Does Not still exist, and how the Void God both Is and Is Not rampaging around the sewers. Retcons are never a good choice, so I prefer to think the other option is more likely..

These past thirty days have been enormously instructive and reinforced my reasons for building a core portfolio around dividend paying equities. The first and most important reason to focus on dividend paying stocks is to capitalize on the enormous effects of compounding.

Basically i would consider it 80% discipline, and 20% read. The read she had on him was probably that he was a respectable player who got it in good. 3 bet preflop basically says "I have a good hand lets gamble." Checking the flop gave a lot of it away. She would be suspecting that he either had aces, kings, queens, or AQ AK. Checking the flop after 3 betting preflop basically narrows a lot of it down. Slow Aces, or AQ or AK. Turn comes, he checks the queen, which means he either is slow playing AQ, which doesn't really make sense, or he really thinks he has a weaker hand. Bet, he calls, the information here is that he does have a hand, just not a good one. River comes an ace, she bet, check shove. If you look at the information just based on what you have it makes total sense for him to have Aces, or AQ, there's no way he has the confidence the check shove AK because he has already represented a good hand. So here are her options, she is calling for a chop, the 5% he is bluffing AK, or he has Aces. AK here has represented too much to shove confidently, so very unlikely. So really her options are call for a chop, or lose. Generally you should never call for a chop unless you are certain what they have. It's a very very disciplined fold to admit that you are beat with a boat. But given the information the dude gave away too much to check shove the river. He gets a call if he shoves straight up.
They will get automatically exercised at expiration day (unless you close the option of course). For instance, a call expired ITM, will get exercised and if you don have the money to cover it, you will get a margin call, meaning you will have to deposit money into the account to fulfill margin requirements, or you could sell the shares immediately.
Oui, on prtend donner le  bon exemple  aux autres ! Il faut aussi rappeler que le CO2 que nous expirons, cela fait tout de mme partie de la vie, pour tous les animaux et tous les tres humains.

He didn remember after, I didn say it back, and all in all I just laughed it off. The second time he said it was about a month later, he was sober, very sincere and had clearly thought a long time about how to tell me, which makes it all the more awkward that my immediate response was "yeah.

You start with a magic ring. Of this I am not kidding! You make a ring around your fingers and you start your chain there. When I first learned crocheting we were told to chain 4, slip stitch to make a circle and then to go in and out of that circle for 4, 6, 8, or how many other stitches we needed to start the pattern, but this magic ring takes away that chaining circle..

You right in that he especially visible because he Turkish, but it disingenuous to pretend he the exception rather than the rule in regards to his viewpoint.I know but it just that modern arguments for acceptance of the term genocide regarding the events almost always use Taner Akcam as an support to back up their claims.

I joined a theater group, later I got a job where I had to approach strangers, and then I got a job as a teaching assistant where I had to hold classes. All of those were incredibly painful and exhausting at first, but having to do these things every week or every day, and being in an environment where I could work through my inhibitions with good friends, helped me get used to it.

A google search will not help them, a science book will not help them, their entire ideology is based on skepticism, so much so that they take any "proof" against their claims as threats designed to cloud "the truth". You can get through to someone like that. It why real science has not put any effort into actually trying to reason with people who think the earth is flat. It futile to debate someone who will not be moved by scientific fact due to them thinking the current scientific method is flawed and created to keep them down.

Christmas we were up kind of early (which was kind of painful after the drinking and nargileh smoking of the night before). We didn know how long it would take to get to Amman so we wanted to have extra time. Thank god   it was such a gray and foggy and rainy day that the visibility while driving in the mountains was about 20 feet. As always, we had to stop ten times along the way to ask directions. Luckily we were guided to the more direct Desert Highway (instead of the scenic mountainous route) and we made it back to Amman with plenty of time to spare. We basically navigated ourselves directly to the disgusting Palace Hotel in downtown Beirut, and pretty much felt like rockstars for having done so!

Let me be clear: one side and one side only has poisoned the well. The Democrats have tried, for decades, to play the game in good faith.

At the end of the summer, the SWAT teams pitch their recommendations to a panel of senior leaders   similar to a "Dragon's Den" scenario.
I realize I used an anecdote to make a point. Not the best way to do that. But, I mean, everyone loves until they find a reason to stop. Animals don go "Oh you know what, I hate the way he cleans pans and doesn contribute to chores, ugh." I think it far more about violating their trust that makes them stop loving you. And I think that takes a lot more effort to make happen than a human falling out of love with you. Cats, I think, are a lot harder to earn their love. It easy to love them but violate their boundaries, unlike dogs. Dogs just don have a lot of boundaries. But if you loved someone to pieces and they just disappeared one day, you still love them even a long time later. If you saw them again after several years, you still be so happy to see them because nothing happened to change how you feel about them. (Though we can realize that them disappearing may mean that they don love us or disrespect our friendship, so then we get mad and move on)
I watched the whole thing and it was amazing. I think that most people that claim to be "woke" or knowledgeable arent out here watching almost 5 hour long videos. I challenge everyone to watch this video with an open mind and pay attention to what is being presented. At the same time i wish joe would just shut the fuck up and let him talk lol. There was so many moments where we could have gone even deeper but joe stops to ask who are "they" and jones looses his train of thought. Really frustrating. They way i explain they to my people is that "they is anyone who isnt us, "they" are people who do not have humanities interest in mind" simple as that and move on.

As someone bellow mentioned, 4bet bluffing at 1/2 is generally lighting money on fire, but if you going to do it anyways, you should at least be doing it with some good blockers, suited wheel hands, ajs. 10 10 is a really bad hand to choose to turn into a bluff here, like I said you block nothing, which is really important since you said your main goal is fold equity, and as I mentioned, you crushed when you get called. If you insist on having a 4bet bluff here, a5s would be miles better..

I like to hang out with friends and play video games in my free time. Although, I plan to work a lot during school and during break, but I like to make sure I have enough time to do all three. When I hang out with my friends, we usually play poker and we always have a blast as someone new wins every time. I play video games with my friends as well, and we could play for as many hours in a day and have the same enjoyment each time.

Ever since the day on which she had made her confession to Anne Leslie had been a changed creature. There was no trace of her old coldness and reserve, no shadow of her old bitterness. The girlhood of which she had been cheated seemed to come back to her with the ripeness of womanhood; she expanded like a flower of flame and perfume; no laugh was readier than hers, no wit quicker, in the twilight circles of that enchanted summer. When she could not be with them all felt that some exquisite savor was lacking in their intercourse. Her beauty was illumined by the awakened soul within, as some rosy lamp might shine through a flawless vase of alabaster. There were hours when Anne's eyes seemed to ache with the splendor of her. As for Owen Ford, the "Margaret" of his book, although she had the soft brown hair and elfin face of the real girl who had vanished so long ago, "pillowed where lost Atlantis sleeps," had the personality of Leslie Moore, as it was revealed to him in those halcyon days at Four Winds Harbor.
