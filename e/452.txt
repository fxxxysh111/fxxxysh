For example, you could spend 150 EUR on training sites over some number of months, play a ton of hands, get a bunch of practice with the concepts, then pay a good coach 100 EUR to review some hands, look through your database to plug leaks, etc. Then you could invest another 250 EUR plus HALF of the money you make in poker into content, coaching, whatever. That basically the offer you should compare to something like BPC. The first option will have much more flexibility overall and less risk, especially in the short term. BPC could be vastly superior if it would take a lot of time and effort to get out of the micros; it would also cap your monetary investment into poker skill assuming you could follow the program requirements. There also the community aspect of being grouped with like minded individuals.

I actually just ran a sim in PIO for this flop in BU vs BB this morning. I gave us a 75% Cbet size on the flop and was betting over pairs at a near pure freq. I was experimenting using a flop overbet strategy for IP as well but looked like 75% had a higher EV. AA was the only overpair that checked back at some freq and I think it was 10% or so. So I mean if you want to add in that mix you can but doesn't seem that substantial to me. Turn is a mandatory call, river seems like a fold to me. You didn't butcher this hand by any stretch of the imagination.

I think Bernie missed his window, which feels weird saying since he was such a long shot to win the nomination two years ago. Bernie 2016 was a breath of fresh air because of the outsider y contrast he presented to Hillary, but now there are other potential and declared candidates that occupy that same niche but have more established records, a clearer story, and more charisma. I am not sure he will be more palatable this time around to mainline Democrats  while the party has moved ideologically towards him, some still hold grudges (unjustified or not) towards him for his actions in 2016. For example, one scientist I work with dislikes Bernie for taking a few weeks to concede after it was mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination. Senator Sanders will also probably continue to struggle to reach minority voters. Despite his excellent record on civil rights, I see no significant movement of minorities towards his camp.

Got fired today from my part time job. I have a 0 hour contract, so I only work when they need me. In my country, by law, a 0 hour contract becomes another contract of you have worked regularly (every weekend) for 6 months. So if I get less hours after those months, I still get paid for it without working for it. That what I found out last week, after not having worked for 3 4 months because they didn need me (but did hire other people for the same hours, okay.). So now they will have to pay me a bunch of money and are "letting me go" because of that.

To examine the differences in risk taking between teens and adults, researchers studied 33 healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17, along with 30 normal adults aged 30 to 50. They all engaged in a gambling game, in which they could take a definite $5 reward or choose between the possibility of getting a much larger payout or nothing at all. The payout was based on whether there was a greater number of red or blue poker chips in a stack of 100; to vary the ambiguity, larger or smaller portions of the stacks were hidden from view.

No, it's not gonna happen. In what world is it a financially lucrative decision to give another anime season to a manga that is pretty much all but dead? Especially if you're only asking for an adaptation of the end of the RdC; you don't even want a full adaptation of the manga with what's happening right now. So how would a new season, as you envision it, help to boost volume sales in any meaningful way? Remember, that's the whole reason manga adaptations get made in the first place. RdC ended over 80 chapters ago, it's old news. There's no financial reason to adapt old material that probably won't even be enough to fill an 11 episode season.

Obviously I disagree with you. It wasn "opinion" in the sense that there was no argument to it. It was just pure and simple propaganda. Biden a smart guy. He could have said "many people of good conscience disagree with out economic policies. here are the sorts of criticisms leveled at us. here why we doing what we doing despite these criticisms." I think the Times Op Ed editor could have said: more argument less propaganda please, Mr. Vice President. Most "opinion" pieces contain real evidence and real argumentation. Unless they comedic. Maybe Biden was doing a spoof of a politician writing an Op Ed?

The elaboration likelihood model proposed by Richard E. Petty and John T. Cacioppo in 1986 is an example of self persuasion theory. It posits three forces that cause receivers to elaborate in one of two ways when processing an ad. Here the term "elaboration" implies issue relevant thinking about such aspects of the ad as its topics, arguments, implications, consequences, promises and executional elements. The two routes that receivers can elaborate on are the central and the peripheral routes.

5: Honestly I have no idea if the cave was supposed to be a 451 reference! If anything I wouldn be surprised if someone was making a slightly rude reference to it NOT being "0451" the code from so many first person games.

A branded station   think Exxon or BP   can only buy its contracted brand of gasoline, which boasts a special recipe.

A close enough approximation to figure out the odds of getting the hand you want is to multiply the number of cards left in the deck that can complete your hand  4 if there are still 2 cards to be drawn, and  2 if there is only one card to be drawn. So, for example, if between the flop and your hand, you have 4 hearts, there are still 9 more hearts in the deck that can give you your flush   which gives you (roughly) 36% chance. If the next card on the table is a spade, you have an 18% chance of getting your flush.

They stumbled through controversies. They made plenty of enemies, sometimes intentionally.

If the issue of unequal pay was just in one industry than maybe it would be poor performance but if actors make more than actresses, male docs more than female docs, business men more than business women, then it gotta be a gender thing because I would imagine women don under preform in all areas of work. Somewhere there a guy making more because he a guy, for doing the same job and preforming the same. Of course anyone of any age or gender can not be good at their jobs and therefore make less money but if the national discrepancy of women making 75 cents to every 1 dollar a man makes, how can it be from solely job preformance?.

Lol that reminds me of a couple years ago. The marching band I was in in high school goes to Indianapolis to compete in bands of America grand nationals and we rented 2 out of 4 floors in a hotel. This one girl microwaved Mac and cheese without the water and it set off all of the fire alarms, filled the top 2 floors with smoke and the smell was god awful. We, along with all of the regular guests and all the staff, had to evacuate the hotel and stand out in the freezing cold until it was deemed safe to return(45 minutes). I feel bad for her. She got so much shit from everyone after that.

LAOP son's actions could have ruined the young woman's life (and it is likely she will have been emotionally damaged from this incident) so I don't really care about his consequences. I am impressed with the young woman to be strong enough to report him because let's not kid ourselves here, women are just expected to ignore this stuff, especially considering many would consider that since nothing was released publicly she has no "damages". I hope she has a good support system with her parents and friends as the legal system can be pretty shitty for sex crime victims.
That's fair, I know many places get a 2 4% charge to run credit cards on their end. Which adds up for them on purchases of that size being made regularly. Also if they buy previously enjoyed watches they may value the cash on hand.

It widely rumored that I hate the dog, and it kind of fun to perpetuate the myth. The truth is, I have nothing against Moose. The only difficulty I have is when people start believing he an actor. Acting to me is a craft, not a reflex. It takes years to master, and though it does have its rewards, the reward I seek is not a hot dog. Moose does tricks; I memorize lines, say words, even walk around and stuff. But I don need a trainer standing off camera, gesticulating wildly and waving around a piece of meat, to know where I supposed to look. Maybe instead of just slowly panning the camera to the window, cut to some gameplay or something that gives the viewer an idea of what playing the game will involve. And for a transition, instead of just a boring cut straight to black, maybe you could have a lightning strike knock the power out, giving you a good chance to cut?

When I first met my "queer spawn" student, she was pretty convinced that gay marriage was a revolution. Over the years, however, she became less convinced. After her father broke up with his long term partner, whom she still considered a parent, my student realized that her gay family was now not part of the gay marriage movement. One of her friends was raised by 4 mothers  the original pairing and then, after they split, the two new parents. How did the gay marriage movement represent their lives? Her dads, who were never married and were no longer even together? Her friend moms? The more she thought about it, she and other "queer spawn" were not terribly well represented by the gay marriage movement. Not only that, but she was unclear whether the people pushing the marriage agenda cared about larger, more important issues like health care or ending the wars.
If you want to work to support your child then reduced child care should be in your favour. Being a single parent is hard enough with out economical stress.

Its a little difficult to think of Ellsworth Kelly, Jacques Villon, Grant Wood, Laslo Moholy Nagy and Thomas Hart Benton as painters for war. But its true, and true for many of hundreds of other artists in the 1915 1918 era. Its not as though they were in the trenches gunning down the enemy or lobbing hand grenades into the swirling gunsmoke. They were camouflage1 artists employed as magicians, Wartime Magi, employed/drafted to make ships and such disappear. since it was (sort of) first noticed in 1915 that designs odd to the environment, stark geometric patterns and such, were capable of fooling the eye, people with design capacity were pressed into service, rendering offensive and defensive instruments of war optically semi impervious with variations of the then five year old modern nonrepresentational art. That must been a very odd position to wake up to every morning. course the idea of camouflage in the animal world is probably 250 million years old animals and insects have been blending into their environment for eons, and I sure too that early hominids did their fair share of walking behind brush. But the idea of hiding great amalgamations of very heavy metal with paint is really quite modern.

In Europe, Arabia, India, China, and throughout North America, dwellings were fumigated to drive out the evil spirits that were believed to cause illness while, at the same time, ridding the dwelling of fleas and bugs.

Patenting the WWW would have most certainly prevented it from ever becoming successful. The Web is mostly a communication standard   a contract between servers and clients for how to exchange data.

I think you are aware when you say here but here and SF bay tend to be people who want to min/max their career. I call it elitecode for a reason. Neither the degree or leetcode will hurt your chances of a job but my point was that both accomplish different things. Leetcode will help with the interview process and should be used as interview prep. The degree will increase your fundamental knowledge while leetcode is more about learning to identify patterns. Sure LSAT prep helps you do better but if you don know the fundamentals then trying to memorize problems is not effective. A lot of stuff isn tested during an interview but the OMSCS will look a lot better on your resume and help you get your foot in the door and negotiate higher salaries.

OPB: You sir are the one who is lazy. You have repeatedly disrespected me and my wonderful companion simply due to the fact that you do not wish to wake up too early in the morning. These issues are your problems and your problems alone. We are both employed and what is your current occupation sir? Preparing marijuana cigarettes is not an occupation. There are so many other negative aspects of your life that I could mention at this time but I feel it is unnecessary considering we both are already aware of these issues. If you continue to treat us in this manner, I will be forced to render you unconscious (or physically harmed in the least), should I gaze upon you. You act as if you are strong when communicating via electronic text based messages, yet you are a coward in person. My female companion would likely end you if you two were to engage in fisticuffs. What do you imagine to accomplish?

I was in middle school when I first got into doctor who and watched the first few series religiously, going back to classic who and buying all the novels and big finish and overpriced merchandise. I 25 now, though, and having a full time job / going through grad school kind of forced me to cool my passion. I caught all the Smith seasons and watched a few Capaldi episodes (I liked him a lot, too) but I never really got as much into it and only watched a few episodes from series 9 and 10. I think that puts me in a territory of "casual viewer"? Anyways, as a casual viewer, I loved series 11. I liked Moffat and his ultra complicated lore and even his obvious fanboyism showing through the episodes, but it kind of nice to just have an episode on and enjoy it rather than having to know all the backstory. All of the episodes from series 11 were standalones and while they kind of lack depth and character development I enjoyed the stories as themselves and appreciate that I can just turn it on even when I tired from work and have fun with pregnant dude in space or witch hunting with Allan Cummings even if I couldn catch last week episode or don know the series long arc. Series 11 definitely sparked my interest back and I really looking forward to more now.
We made sure there was always a difference between formula in her bottle and water in her sippy cup. When she turned one, we gave half formula and half cows milk. She took fine to it. So we straight up gave her cows milk and was happy to be rid of formula. Cows milk was like no change at all so we introduced another change and gave her milk in her sippy cup and never looked back. She hasn't had the bottle since.

Speaking as someone who, along with my kids, went completely gluten and dairy free for years: Yes, they absolutely will eat differently at others houses.

Suggest a pattern, playing a clean mind game/like a story with your bets, calls/raises. Though, doing nothing special is likely to win a hand when everything is going right. Still, experienced players, can win pretty often when nothing is going right by representing (as if) having the goods, by playing, but not by lying. If you are seen as being a consistent liar, people will ignore your bluff, and few (or no one) will be scared by your bluff. Play "tight"/seeming real, conservative (not loose) most often, then go strong, convincingly at the opportune moment; so your opponent gets "that sick, losing feeling"   believing you have another good hand, fearing and avoiding a big risk, and so they fold (that's how a bluff can work). No matter how much advice you've followed from this article, a sudden river (5th Street) bet will not tell a cohesive story on its own, to lead people to believe the suggestion you make.

You seem to think that polyamorous people have no morals whatsoever and just do whatever. I think that most actually have very strict guidelines what is okay and what is not. Also, you have to put the same amount of trust in your partner, if not more, to be faithful to the relationship.

$21.49 I 90/100The Mission Hill Reserve Series is crazy excellent value, and each year it simply outdoes the previous version. Case in point, the 2017 Sauvignon Blanc. Multiple pick times bring a vibrancy and freshness to this wine. Some 20 per cent of the wine spends time in oak and concrete (split about 50/50) while the balance remains on its lees in stainless steel. Look for a tropical pineapple, citrus nose that previews a taut, dry, lemon grass, lime palate and finishes with a creamy, sagebrush scented note. Impressive value. Shellfish anyone?

And in cases like these, dangers to things must always be 100% irrelevant in the face of dangers to human lives, so, not sure what your point is, especially when the "danger to humanity" also clearly implies "dangers to the rocket".

I really have a hard time believing he was a child molester. Although I like almost all his music, I did not idolize him like most.

Well yes, I do believe this. Socialism is the only system in which poor people's needs are taken into account, as opposed to those of the already rich and powerful. and it should be obvious that capitalism doesn't work for average people. government does not want poor people in Latin America to be better off, because America's giant companies won't have cheap labor to exploit anymore. I am truly ashamed to be an American, with such a government. The Soviet Union should have wiped America off the face of the planet in the Cuban Missile Crisis   then, this oppressive monster known as the United States would not to this day be able to suppress the working classes of this world with its capitalist ideology, which relies on preventing oppressed people from fighting back and demanding change.

He was devastated when he learned Lane had concealed so much from him, he tells Becroft. "I had no comprehension whatsoever that she had two babies in the four years I was going out with her."

I think your boyfriend is being quite foolish finishing a relationship over this. A lot of people do long distance, it's not really any different from that, and he could have easily gone over and visited you in several times during the year.

And that was true Friday at Sellersville Theater 1894.

Shot in mostly grays and blues with streaks of piercing light, Garenq conjures up an oppressing atmosphere.

This is the work of Etienne Marey (who has made a number of appearances on this blog), a very smart and versatile guy who would go from physiology to cinematography to aerodynamics in the course of his life and be a leader/pioneer in each field. Marey published this "strobophotograph" in his article "Analyse cinematique de la marche" in the Comptes Rendus on 19 May 1884 this was a brilliant effort in the analysis of human locomotion by making a dozen or two exposures on a single photo sheets of a reflective outlined walking figure. This was different from Marey birthyear and deathyear buddy, the other motion picture pioneer, Eadweard Muytbridge (1830 1904 for both). Marey introduced his "chronophotography" and studied aspects of movement and motion that had been dispersed to human history because of the inability to observe and record them with Marey, that issue necessary for the beginning of real scientific discourse was to a large extent solved.
